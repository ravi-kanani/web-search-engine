       <h2>We're Also Holding A Virtual Mastermind</h2> 
       <p>Around the time of our virtual summit from May 6-8, we'll also be running a <strong>special "virtual" mastermind meeting</strong> composed of sellers making at least $100k in revenue.</p> 
       <p><strong>There will be 3 tiers of Mastermind groups</strong></p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Sellers making over $1M in revenue</li> 
        <li>Sellers making over $250k in revenue</li> 
        <li>Sellers making over $100k in revenue</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>This will be a very <strong>intense virtual event</strong> with only 6-8 attendees in each Mastermind group. Each participant will come away with brand new insights about their business from another entrepreneur's perspective.</p> 
       <p>Many people attend the Sellers Summit just for the mastermind alone! <strong>Join our virtual Mastermind...</strong></p> 
       <ul> 
        <li><strong>If you like the idea</strong> of spending an afternoon with other enthusiastic, growth-oriented entrepreneurs and working "on" your business rather than "in" your business...</li> 
        <li><strong>If you appreciate</strong> the benefits of stepping away and bonding with other ecommerce entrepreneurs in a highly productive environment</li> 
        <li><strong>If you see the value</strong> of getting another pair of eyes on your business to find new ways to grow and expand</li>

       <h2>Not Your Ordinary Feel Good Event</h2> 
       <p>At the 2020 Sellers Summit, we're here to teach and for you to learn. In fact, I wouldn't call the Sellers Summit a "normal" virtual event.</p> 
       <h3>It's more like an intense 3 day ecommerce workshop</h3> 
       <p></p> 
       <p>After all, would you rather listen to a bunch of random entrepreneurs tell inspiring stories about their past or would you rather come away with real, actionable strategies that will actually make you money?</p> 
       <p>The Sellers Summit is the ultimate <strong>"ecommerce learning experience"</strong> where you will get inspired not by stories, but by gaining all of the knowledge required to run your own successful ecommerce business</p> 
       <p>My goal is to teach you in 3 days what most people struggle to learn in months, if not years.</p>
