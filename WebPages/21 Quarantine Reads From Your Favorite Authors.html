But remember that everyone is in this together — even the authors whose books are on your nightstand right now. Bustle has put together a list of <a class="PlU" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2020-03-17/authors-list-books-they-might-finally-read-in-quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21 books your favorite authors are reading while quarantined</a>, so you can read along with them, or crib reading recommendations from their notes.</p>
       <p>Many authors are finding comfort in pandemic-centric fiction. Like Crissy Van Meter, who is hunkering down with her copy of Gabriel García Márquez's classic novel <em>Love in the Time of Cholera</em>. Or Gish Jen, who's reading <em>They Came Like Swallows</em>, an epic about the Flu Epidemic of 1918 and how it impacts one individual family. But other novelists are seeking out escapism by way of their bookshelf. Abby Jimenez is devouring romance novels like <em>The Honey-Don’t List, </em>which has many parallels to the Netflix rom-com, <em>Set It Up</em>. And Stephanie Wrobel is all about the incisive take on celebrity culture and reality television, <em>Followers</em>.</p>
       <p>Read on for the 21 books your favorite authors are keeping calm with during quarantine. Let them inspire you, entertain you, and above all, offer you a little levity. </p>

        "Elegant, engaging, and complex, <em>The Tenth Muse</em> by Catherine Chung follows the story of Katherine — a Chinese-American girl with an incredible aptitude for math, who is growing up in the 1950s Midwest and whose life is defined by two mysteries: why her mother inexplicably left her, and her quest to solve one of the most elusive math problems in history. As she pursues the answers to these puzzles, that surprisingly intertwine, the journey takes her deep into secrets hidden during World War II and also into the harsh, patriarchal world of academia. I love this book because it asks big questions: Who am I? Where do I come from? What are the costs of female ambition? Of love? And answers them as they impact a single lifetime, on a deeply personal, intimate scale. Katherine is a protagonist who refuses to be silenced in a male-dominated world and an openly racist society and looks to the genius of women whose stories were lost, buried for strength, for inspiration. I think a lot of us can relate to feeling connections like that, through time. I don’t need all the novels I read to have a happy ending but I like stories with grit, that lean into hope. And even when confronted with the possibility that what she seeks might ultimately be unattainable, Katherine persists."

        "There’s two types of people in the world — the ones that need a well-deserved break from COVID-19 coverage and the ones that popped some extra-buttered popcorn and queued up <em>Contagion</em> on Netflix. I’m the latter sort, and immediately revisited <em>Blindness</em> by José Saramago, in which the inhabitants of an unnamed city lose their sight one by one. It’s stayed with me because of the vibrant language with which Saramago renders this psychological dive into how a mystery epidemic brings out the worst in people. Upon reread it feels eerily prescient and the novel gets dark, but what emerges are these immeasurable bright spots of hope and humanity. The fear of disease becomes secondary to the real story — one about love and sacrifice and the surprising ways a community can come together (in the metaphorical, social-distancing sense) and start to rebuild."

        "I bought this book in Boston in late February, on my first (and it looks like, for now, only) leg of my book tour for my novel <em>The Illness Lesson</em>, and read it shortly after, when the entire world had changed. I had high expectations; it has exceeded them. <em>Oligarchy </em>is dark and gothic and hilarious and so sharp on the sentence level I can feel my mind waking up when I read it. It’s set at an English boarding school, where a group of adolescent girls take on anorexia as a sort of group project (groomed in this, we will learn, by sinister forces). It’s perfect quarantine reading in that it makes me very grateful I’m no longer quarantined inside the mind of a teenage girl — that endless hyperaware reading of peers and self, an entrapping cycle of comparison; that constant, exhausting turning of every feeling inward. And yet it’s pure aesthetic pleasure to live in these pages too, because Thomas allows these girls their full intelligence. Here’s a skewering description of one character’s disgust for a member of the school’s staff: 'From her neck to her knees, a zone that should be all interest and angles and light and shade, there is just one great milky mass, like a boring hike on the moon.' Yes, just like that. Or another: 'She is well-groomed and well-maintained, but she looks like money rather than sex or love.' There’s a piercing clarity to the vision here. It’s the kind of seeing that only art makes possible. And so this book has been, for me, an urgently needed reminder of the gifts of reading and writing — during this time when it might be easy enough to sink under and stop doing either."

        "I usually have several books going at once. I just finished <em>There There</em> by Tommy Orange, which was harrowing and illuminating. I just started <em>Girl, Woman, Other </em>(last year's Booker Prize winner) by Bernardine Evaristo, and I’m already hooked — reminding me of the life I lived in London in the late 1970s. And then, for the last 50 years I’ve more or less been reading <em>Lord of the Rings</em> on a continuous loop. Of late have been thinking of the classic exchange in which Frodo says, 'I wish none of this had happened,' and Gandalf responds, 'So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.'"

        "Last week, I read a number of quietly devastating books but this week, I felt like I really needed to read something funny. I started Ali Wong’s <em>Dear Girls</em> and slid off the couch laughing. The premise is that she tells her two young daughters what she went through and the advice that she can give based on her experiences. I love this book for many reasons — first because she is such an excellent writer that pays great attention to perfect word choice, but also because it makes me think so much about how I don’t know what kind of lives my conservative Korean parents lived before they had me, because they presented such a very limited version of themselves. I wish <em>my</em> father had written a brutally honest account of his youth before he passed away, and predicted what advice I would need. Ali Wong explodes every preconception about Asians as a model minority and a good parent, and in the process cements her transcendence into an even better role model in both capacities. These days, I feel that the racist vitriol hurled at Asian faces in America stems on a large part from the preconception of Asians as a passive model minority, and we need more Asians to explode that idea the way Ali Wong does so raunchily."

        "I’ve been reading and rereading the poems in Michael Prior’s second collection, which grapples with the legacy of Japanese Canadian incarceration during World War II. The burning province of the title references wildfires that ravaged British Columbia in 2015 and 2017 — a recurring backdrop in the book. These poems map out the ways in which historical traumas and grief endure from generation to generation, and yet, throughout, there is an unwavering appreciation for the beauty of all living things — stuttering fireflies, a corgi straining on her leash, flowers surviving in salt water, earless newborn salamanders… The poet Ishion Hutchinson calls Prior’s voice 'tenderly apocalyptic.' Exactly the kind of voice I’ve needed to turn to these days."

Shippen's debut novel, <em>The Infinite Noise</em>, was tender and lovely and achingly kind.

I read <em>Crossing to Safety</em> for the first time at least 25 years ago, and it has remained in my mind since that time as the perfect novel. That was long before I started writing and even reading more critically, so I have been somewhat reluctant to return to it, and perhaps have that impression tainted. But, as we're all learning so distinctly, there's no day like the present one and I feel inexplicably compelled to return to that story of life, marriage and friendship. The silver lining of this quarantine period can be open time, solitude and a return to simple pleasures. I'm looking forward to rediscovering my favorite novel in the coming days."

        "A Beverly Jenkins romance is like literary comfort food: reliably delicious every time. So, reading <em>Night Hawk</em> during this difficult week was a no-brainer, and I’m so glad I did. The hero gives me olden-days Batman vibes, the heroine is the funniest, most badass lady I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading, and their romp across the Wild West as reluctant jailer and defiant prisoner is swoon-worthy fun."

        "I am re-reading <em>They Came Like Swallows</em>, William Maxwell's masterpiece about the Flu Epidemic of 1918 and its effect on one family. Illness, regret, recovery, loss: it's our times in another key. We watch as ordinary lives take an extraordinary turn — the flu felling some and sparing others, and laying bare their emotional lives as it goes. People don't survive but love does in this book. It is at once devastating and steadying. I can't recommend it highly enough."

        "Amidst the rise of blatant racism against Asians, how lucky we are to also have Cathy Park Hong's <em>Minor Feelings, </em>the work of Asian American racial theory we have been waiting for. In essays that read at turns like criticism, poetry, theory, and memoir, Hong puts language to feelings so murky and dissonant that even the inquisitive mind may be tempted to look away in shame. But I am grateful for her courage: the precision and depth of her questioning is a fine companion for these times of anxious solitude. Each essay is compulsively readable in its own right, but more pleasurable is how the pieces build up, with inventive, surprising movement, to a clarion call to action: for Asian Americans to reject the false lure of whiteness, unzip our histories from invisibility, and step out from amnesia into activism and art. Not since turning to Baldwin after the 2016 election have I found this kind of solace and urgency in reading."

        "I'm a promiscuous reader so I usually have about 3 books on the go at once. The one I'm finding most comforting at the moment is <em>Hope in the Dark: Untold Histories, Wild Possibilities</em> by Rebecca Solnit. It was originally written not long after September 11th and the Iraq War, though it's been re-issued and updated with prefaces since then. I was in my early teens when all that happened, younger and more naive that I am now. The recent outbreak has given me a similar sort of feeling of despair mixed with the hope that maybe people will start to become better, to look out for each other, and to enable us to move to a fairer tomorrow. That maybe we'll realize we need to rethink society to protect us against something like this happening again in the future. I really appreciate how Solnit doesn't shy away from difficult moments in history and yet still manages to help lift the despair and show that yes, things are terrible, and hard, but there are so many people doing amazing work. We are more powerful than we know. Remember: 'And when you face a politics that aspires to make you fearful, alienated, and isolated, joy is a fine initial act of insurrection.' I'm trying to find moments of joy in this strange, shifting new normal we are in now."

        "I’ve begun a reread of Anita Brookner’s fiction, starting (for no special reason) with <em>Fraud</em>. Brookner has slipped out of fashion, but her ruminative, inward-looking fiction, with its naturally self-isolating characters, may be a corrective to over-excitement. Her work is cohesive, astringent and far funnier than her critics stopped to notice. And there are 24 novels, and if you like one, you will like them all — so you can see out your quarantine in contentment."

What I can say is that the dedication — the <em>dedication</em> — to this collection may be the best short story I've ever read: 'It seems right to dedicate this collection to my friend Sybil Claiborne, my colleague in the Writing and Mother Trade. I visited her fifth-floor apartment on Barrow Street one day in 1957. There before my very eyes were her two husbands disappointed by the eggs. After that we talked and talked for nearly forty years. Then she died. Three days before that, she said slowly, with the delicacy of an unsatisfied person with only a dozen words left, Grace, the real question is — how are we to live our lives?' Are you flat on your back? Have you texted a friend in all caps? If so, good news: Grace Paley is for you and you are for her and she's going to do her darndest to help you get through this quarantine in one piece."

The characterization is too-notch, and that includes the city — I like New York, but seeing it through the eyes of a character who adores it made me adore it. Maybe order a calligraphy lesson book while you’re at it... this book made me want to take calligraphy lessons, and I have the handwriting of a drunk toddler writing with their non dominant hand.

Still, I’m a hopeless romantic and everything about this book, especially the longing and this epic love story, makes me swoon.

The story takes place in two timelines: the first is thirty years in the future, set in a Californian village where government-appointed celebrities live their lives in front of a camera 24/7; the second is set in present day, where two friends are willing to do whatever it takes to make it big. It's a hugely imaginative story about ambition, friendship, and social media. The writing is crisp and hilarious. What more could you want? This one was such a joy to read."

As she pursues the answers to these puzzles, that surprisingly intertwine, the journey takes her deep into secrets hidden during World War II and also into the harsh, patriarchal world of academia. I love this book because it asks big questions: Who am I? Where do I come from? What are the costs of female ambition? Of love? And answers them as they impact a single lifetime, on a deeply personal, intimate scale. Katherine is a protagonist who refuses to be silenced in a male-dominated world and an openly racist society and looks to the genius of women whose stories were lost, buried for strength, for inspiration. I think a lot of us can relate to feeling connections like that, through time. I don’t need all the novels I read to have a happy ending but I like stories with grit, that lean into hope.

It’s stayed with me because of the vibrant language with which Saramago renders this psychological dive into how a mystery epidemic brings out the worst in people. Upon reread it feels eerily prescient and the novel gets dark, but what emerges are these immeasurable bright spots of hope and humanity.

I had high expectations; it has exceeded them. "],[0,[2],1,"Oligarchy "],[0,[],0,"is dark and gothic and hilarious and so sharp on the sentence level I can feel my mind waking up when I read it. It’s set at an English boarding school, where a group of adolescent girls take on anorexia as a sort of group project (groomed in this, we will learn, by sinister forces). It’s perfect quarantine reading in that it makes me very grateful I’m no longer quarantined inside the mind of a teenage girl — that endless hyperaware reading of peers and self, an entrapping cycle of comparison; that constant, exhausting turning of every feeling inward. And yet it’s pure aesthetic pleasure to live in these pages too, because Thomas allows these girls their full intelligence. Here’s a skewering description of one character’s disgust for a member of the school’s staff: 'From her neck to her knees, a zone that should be all interest and angles and light and shade, there is just one great milky mass, like a boring hike on the moon.' Yes, just like that. Or another: 'She is well-groomed and well-maintained, but she looks like money rather than sex or love.' There’s a piercing clarity to the vision here. It’s the kind of seeing that only art makes possible.
