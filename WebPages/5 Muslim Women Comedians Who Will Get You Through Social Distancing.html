       <p><strong>Quarantine Survival Tip</strong>: Meditate</p>
       <p>To be honest, I don’t remember life B.C. — <em>before corona</em>. My parents were both born in Baghdad, Iraq. It must have been huge for them, given that they’re immigrants, for their daughter to suddenly be like, “I don’t want to use my college degree. I want to make jokes.” But my mom is a fan; she comments on all my Instagram jokes.</p>
       <p>As a college-touring comedian, the majority of my performances are centered around certain dates — spring break [and] the end of the year are huge for me. I lost the bulk of my performances, or they’re being pushed to next fall. One school is letting me do it virtually for an hour, like a Zoom stand-up performance. I hope my parents don't say, “I told you so.” Like... please.</p>

       <p><strong>Quarantine Survival Tip</strong>: Feel all your feelings and channel that energy to create something</p>
       <p>It's enough dealing with the stereotype that women aren't funny, but add Arab and Muslim to the mix, and it's a turducken of racism and sexism. Our body-hair jokes are real, but most of us have been culturally shamed into getting it removed. It's easier to perform for open-minded people in places like New York City, but performing in remote parts in the country, I'm always afraid, "Am I going to trigger the wrong person?"</p>
       <p>People don't know that Muslim women are diverse and that we don't all subscribe to the same religious ideals and philosophies. That's why I co-created the web series <a class="PlU" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBBkwFRlqCw7eYQGPZ2XuQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Muslim Girls DTF: Discuss Their Faith</a>, so people can see we have different points of view, especially when it comes to religion and culture.</p>
       <p>As a comedian, most of my income is from touring. I was supposed to start a six-city tour, but due to coronavirus that got cancelled. There's no telling what this industry will look like in a few months. A lot of us are doing virtual open mics on Instagram Live or virtual shows through Zoom. I joined my friend, comedian <a class="PlU" href="https://twitter.com/alisultancomedy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali Sultan</a>, in producing a weekly Zoom show called <a class="PlU" href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-comics-find-a-way-to-laugh-while-it-hurts/569126932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Distancing Comedy</a>.

       <p><strong>Age</strong>: 23, if anyone in Hollywood asks</p>
       <p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Between New York and Los Angeles</p>
       <p><strong>Currently Social Distancing In</strong>: Los Angeles, all by myself, but I have a <a class="PlU" href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/11/22/tech/web/bellini-boyfriend-pillow/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boyfriend pillow</a> I've named Nathaniel</p>
       <p><strong>Career Highlight</strong>: Appearing on the <em>Steve Harvey Show</em> and producing <a class="PlU" href="http://www.facialrecognitioncomedy.com/producers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facial Recognition Comedy</a> </p>
       <p><strong>Role Model</strong>: Joan Rivers </p>
       <p><strong>Quarantine Survival Tip</strong>: Try wearing a bra at least once a week. It's hard for me to make adult decisions when I'm not wearing a bra. </p>
       <p>Like so many comics, I've lost at least a hundred gigs at this point. I really miss stand-up. I have a microphone in my house, so I'll walk around with it and blurt out thoughts. I'm thinking of a live stand-up show through Zoom, and putting all my stuffed animals and Nathaniel, my boyfriend pillow, on the couch.</p>
       <p>But quarantine has given me time to work on my book, all [about] the lies I've told leading my double life: lying to my parents, leaving the house, and trying to have some semblance of an "American girl's life."</p>
       <p>It's still a boys' club [in comedy], even though there are very talented women finally getting a spotlight. I produce <a class="PlU" href="http://facialrecognitioncomedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a show that's <em>all</em> women of color</a>. I promise we have more in common than not. I know you're all looking up "exotic chicks" on Pornhub, so if we're good enough for Pornhub, we're good enough for your YouTube feeds, Instagram, and social media feeds, too!</p>

       <p><strong>Quarantine Survival Tip</strong>: Download TikTok</p>
       <p>We don't get the same respect as our non-Brown counterparts. [At] one of my first open mics, a guy started ragging on Indians, and he goes, “Why are Indians so materialistic?” I was like, “I don't know, bro. I'm not Indian.” </p>
       <p>As a Brown woman and a Muslim in the comedy community, people seem [to think] there can only be <em>one</em>. There can only be <em>one</em> Muslim Brown woman killing it at the game. But how many shows feature all white comedians? That's one of the reasons me and <a class="PlU" href="https://lpr.com/lpr_artists/pooja-reddy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pooja Reddy</a> created our show, <a class="PlU" href="https://thetanknyc.org/calendar-1/2020/1/11/kutti-gang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kutti Gang</a>. We have a roster every other month with South Asian comedians, who are women, LGBTQ, gender-nonconforming. We fill up our seats, which shows we don't need to be in competition with each other. We need to support each other.</p>

       <p><strong>Quarantine Survival Tip</strong>: FaceTime friends and family</p>
       <p>My family's from Pakistan. When people ask me where I’m from, I always say, “Do you want to know where I'm from, or where I'm <em>from</em> from?” Some of the biggest challenges are the misconceptions people have [about] what Brown women’s comedy should sound like. When you're on stage, people say, “You know what you should do? It would be better if you talked about X, Y, or Z. Then you'd be more marketable! <em>This</em> would make your comedy better.” </p>
       <p>It's challenging [when] people think you need to be more “marketable," when people tell you what you should and shouldn't say about your culture. People feel like they can give input on what cultural things you speak to. [But ultimately,] the great thing about artists and performers is that they love to be creative, and they'll find an outlet to do that. If you want to do stand-up, you'll find a way to do stand-up.</p>
