This Policy is intended to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Website. Please take a minute to read and understand the Policy. This Policy should also be read in conjunction with our <a href="/privacy/?site=giovannafletcher.com">Privacy Policy</a> and our <a href="/terms/?site=giovannafletcher.com">General Terms</a>.</p>

        </ul>

You will find a list of all cookies used by our Website in the “How Our Website Uses Cookies” section of this Policy.

        <h2>Control your cookie settings</h2>

        <p>The following link contains further information about cookies: http://www.aboutcookies.org/.</p> 
        <h2>How Our Website Uses Cookies</h2> 
        <p>We use several different types of cookies. In particular, we use: necessary cookies which enable certain fundamental website features; functionality cookies which allow us to remember choices you make (e.g. your cookie preference); and performance cookies which monitor usage of our Website. Some of these are session cookies which are temporary and allow us to link your actions during a single visit to our site, and which are erased when you close your browser. Others are persistent cookies which remain on your device for the period of time specified in the cookie. The following is a more detailed explanation of the types of cookies we use, categorised by the purpose of the cookies:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li><strong>Necessary Cookies</strong>: Necessary cookies are essential and help you navigate the Website. These cookies are anonymous, and do not collect or store any personally identifying information about you. Without these cookies, we may not be able to provide the services you have asked for. For example, these cookies make sure that you only have to verify your age by responding to the age-gate once on your first visit, rather than every time you visit the Website. These cookies also help to support website security and basic functionality and are necessary for the proper operation of our Website, so if you block these cookies we can't guarantee your use or the security of our Website during your visit.</li> 
         <li><strong>Functionality Cookies</strong>: Functionality cookies are used to provide you the best user experience. They also allow the website to remember choices made (such as language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features.</li> 
         <li><strong>Performance Cookies</strong>: Performance cookies help us to understand the behaviour of our visitors and their usage of the Website in an aggregated manner. This allows us to continuously improve the Website to provide the best user experience. These cookies are also used to help us understand how effective our advertising is; for instance these cookies tell us which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. All information these cookies collect is aggregated, to assist us to improve how a website works. Some of these cookies may managed by third parties (such as Google and Facebook). We have no control over the dissemination of third party cookies and you should check the relevant third party’s website for more information.</li> 
        </ul>
