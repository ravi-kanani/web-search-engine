    <p>Here’s a small sampling of newsletter articles:</p> 
    <p><a href="/spy">No more spy pixels</a><br>I don’t know if you’ve opened or read my newsletter.</p> 
    <p><a href="/timtoady">Most advice is too prescriptive to be useful</a><br>In other words, Tim Toady is a racecar driver.</p> 
    <p><a href="/wealth">How to build wealth slowly</a><br>You don’t have to pick stocks or have huge swaths of money to start investing.</p> 
    <p><a href="/thinks">Thinking thinky thinks</a><br>We’re in a weird place right now, those of us who make a living from thinking.</p> 
    <p><a href="/union2020">State of the Union, 2020</a><br>For the fifth year in a row, I present to you the Paul Jarvis state of the union address.</p> 
    <p><a href="/enemy">The enemy</a><br>I’ve noticed a concerning trend lately: small business owners who sell anything are being seen and labelled as the enemy by some folks online.</p> 
    <p><a href="/lovework">Do we have to love our work?</a><br>When employers are looking to hire, they always seem to want people that are passionate about the company's mission. Is that necessary?</p> 
    <p><a href="/hide">But I have nothing to hide</a><br>Privacy isn’t just for those who have nefarious reasons to hide things from others, but for everyone.</p> 
    <p><a href="/insta">Keeping up with the Insta-Joneses</a><br>It’s a social arms race, much like a military one, where no one actually wins.</p> 
    <p><a href="/advice">The advice gold rush</a><br>The problem with this situation is much like the real Gold Rush: it’s mostly hype and bullshit, while a few people get rich off the misconceptions of the general public.</p> 
    <p><a href="/distractions">Work like you’re driving</a><br>We’ve been sold the idea that notifications are always important and we should allow them to constantly distract us.</p> 
    <p><a href="/go">Take back your online privacy</a><br>Create your own digital grab-and-go kit</p> 
    <p><a href="/hits">Greatest hits</a><br>I think more bloggers, podcasters, and content creators in general might consider offering up their “greatest hits” on a more frequent basis.</p> 
    <p><a href="/union2019">State of the Union, 2019</a><br>For the fourth year in a row, I present to you my state of the union address.</p> 
    <p><a href="/course">How to create and sell an online course in WordPress: a step-by-step guide</a><br>Go from zero to a fully launched WordPress course without programming, technical skills or any prior knowledge.</p> 
    <p><a href="/blogger">I’d rather be a blogger</a><br>Content marketing and blogging may be diametrically opposed to each other, but one isn’t bad and the other good.</p> 
    <p><a href="/enough">Enough</a><br>Exterior mindfulness (some call it minimalism) only works when we solve for enough.</p> 
    <p><a href="/truth">The measure of truth</a><br>It’s hard to think that something we believe to be correct could be wrong. It hurts our ego.</p> 
    <p><a href="/opportunity">The true cost of an amazing opportunity</a><br>I can count on zero of my fingers how many times someone’s told me about an “amazing opportunity” which actually turned into something awesome.</p> 
    <p><a href="/productive">What’s the point of productivity?</a><br>If you succeed at maximum productivity, where will your own time and energy go?</p> 
    <p><a href="/capitalism">Capitalism is a snowball rolling down a steep hill</a><br>Capitalism isn’t an immutable law, but simply something we collectively believe in.</p> 
    <p><a href="/union2018">State of the Union, 2018</a><br>I have no idea what’s to come in 2018 beyond a rough and simple plan, but I’m excited. Even though my style, outlook and writings are mostly “angry man shouts at the computer screen”, I’m actually hopeful. I hope you are too.</p> 
    <p><a href="/business">Four rules for a minimalist business</a><br>The Sunday Dispatches newsletter, weekly articles since 2012—written by Paul Jarvis and read by 35k+ subscribers.</p> 
    <p><a href="/motivational">Motivational quotes are ruining your life</a><br>There are few things that incite rage in me like seeing a motivational quote on social media.</p> 
    <p><a href="/gravy">Happiness and gravy</a><br>I expect very little from anything I do.</p> 
    <p><a href="/mind">I think I’ve lost my mind</a><br>Do you ever get a sense of dread or feel overwhelmed when you think about your list of what you need to do within a certain amount of time?</p> 
    <p><a href="/union2017">State of the Union, 2017</a><br>To start, 2016 was probably the most rollercoaster year for me ever.</p> 
    <p><a href="/off">I put a lot of people off</a><br>If you let your ethics and point of view into your brand, you’re going to leave money off the table.</p> 
    <p><a href="/growth">I don’t actually care about growth</a><br>I’m better at working than delegating work any way.</p> 
    <p><a href="/passion">Follow your passion</a><br>Trying to find your passion is a recipe for disaster - or at best, a recipe for horrible disappointment (note: the recipe includes pickles).</p> 
    <p><a href="/anger">I’m mostly motivated by anger</a><br>In the end, it’s not about trying to train ourselves to never get mad. That sounds like a recipe for disaster resulting in ripped shirts and green skin...</p> 
    <p><a href="/war">There is a war going on for your mind</a><br>We end up believing the stories we tell ourselves</p> 
    <p><a href="/union2016">State of the Union, 2016</a><br>I’ve spent the last few months quietly reflecting on both 2015 and what lies ahead for 2016.</p> 
    <p><a href="/mental">Mental Minimalism</a><br>What if we applied minimalism to our mental space?</p> 
    <p><a href="/break">There’s no such thing as a big break</a><br>Achievement is never the result of a single action, it’s the build-up of all of our actions.</p> 
    <p><a href="/apples">No one on the Internet is living the life you think they are</a><br>I’m not, you’re not, no one is. And that’s totally ok! Everyone’s got their own ups and downs. Everyone’s life is filled with fuck-ups, mistakes, disasters but also amazing beauty.</p> 
    <p><a href="/simple">On simplifying: pizza and complications</a><br>We like to complicate things. Product launches, service offerings, websites, pizza…</p> 
    <p><a href="/peak">What if your best work is behind you?</a><br>It’s a numbers game, and not everything is a winner.</p> 
    <p><a href="/shit">Stop doing shit you don’t like</a><br>Consider yourself in the choices you make.</p> 
    <p><a href="/expression">The motivating and scary allure of expressing yourself in your work</a><br>What makes any of us us&nbsp;isn’t our set of skills, experience or accolades—it’s how we use our personalities and self-expression in our work.</p> 
    <p><a href="/focus">Focus and Control</a><br>We can pretty much succeed at anything. Conversely, we can fail at anything, too.</p> 
    <p><a href="/survivorship">Survivorship Bias and Hungry, Hungry Hippos</a><br>When Tim Ferriss or Seth Godin (or insert name of successful person here) write and release a book in a new and different way, of course it’s going to do well. They’re Tim and Seth!</p> 
    <p><a href="/whale">The problem with curated photos on social media</a><br>Maybe the next time you take a photo and post it you’ll question your motivations as well.</p> 
    <p><a href="/trolls">What do you do when the trolls come marching in?</a><br>I’ve been called a spammer, a hack, a link-baiter, a self-centred and flippant asshole, and shoddy excuse for a writer who would do better if I stopped putting articles out.</p> 
    <p><a href="/bears">Why I’m so negative about positivity</a><br>Let’s talk about white bears and Stay Puff Marshmallow Men.</p> 
    <p><a href="/quit">Call me a quitter, just ask Vince Lombardi</a><br>There's the old adage, a quitter never wins and a winner never quits, that tells us to slog on when something's not working, and tough things out until they do.</p> 
    <p><a href="/cake">Why your work needs both cake and icing</a><br>Marketing is icing. If there’s not a cake underneath, it’d be pretty hard for it stand up in the shape of a cake by itself. We can’t just focus on making icing. We need to also make the cake.</p> 
    <p><a href="/attention">Attention is a gift you give to your work</a><br>The more attention you devote to something, the less space fear can occupy.</p> 
    <p><a href="/rats">Find your rat people</a><br>For your creativity to support you, you need to find your 1%. Your rat people.</p> 
    <p><a href="/more">The Metric of More</a><br>The problem with the metric of more is that it’s dehumanizing. It’s easily the biggest problem with this new hyper-connected economy.</p> 
    <p><a href="/work">Do what you love</a><br>Even as someone who works for myself and makes a living off of creativity, it’s not always fun and holding hands while letting the rays of sunshine wash over my face.</p> 
    <p><a href="/rich">How to be rich like me</a><br>People assume that if they’ve heard of you, you must be raking it in.</p> 
    <p><a href="/goals">No goals</a><br>I decided not to have any goals. Not a single one. Not then, not now. I still avoid them as much as possible, almost as much as I resist owning a suit and tie.</p> 
    <p><a href="/write">I wrote an article no one wanted</a><br>No, not this one, a different one (that’d be too meta).</p> 
    <p><a href="/love">A (fall out of) love note</a><br>Fall out of love with your inner critic immediately. Kill its voice before it kills you.</p> 
    <p><a href="/compare">I don’t live up to my online self</a><br>Online me is a fearless, straight-shooting, awesome(ish) communicator. While nothing about that is an actual lie, it’s not always true.</p> 
    <p><a href="/best">When is the best time to create?</a><br>Creating great work is a numbers game. The more time we spend creating, the more likely we are to create something great.</p> 
    <p><a href="/art">Fuck stats, make art</a><br>Trying to follow a formula, script or tactic to get more traffic, sales or followers never works in the long run because it screams inauthenticity.</p>
