            <p>For WooCommerce hosting you need an optimized hosting solution equipped to handle WooCommerce stores out of the box. </p> 
            <p>WooCommerce is the world’s most popular eCommerce platform. It is used by millions of small and large businesses all over the world. It runs on WordPress, so you will obviously need a hosting provider that supports WordPress. </p> 
            <p>But that’s not all. </p> 
            <p>You will need a domain name (e.g. wpbeginner.com) and an SSL Certificate to accept online payments. You will also need the back-end servers to be optimized for WooCommerce for better performance.</p> 
            <p>As your online store grows, you will have to consider how to handle that traffic with no downtime. </p> 
            <p>A good WooCommerce hosting company should offer you all these things that you’ll not get with a typical <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/the-truth-about-shared-wordpress-web-hosting/" title="The Truth About Best Shared WordPress Web Hosting">shared WordPress hosting</a> account. To sweeten the deal, you will also get support from staff trained to deal with WooCommerce websites on a daily basis. </p> 
            <p>The idea behind WooCommerce hosting is to offer a hassle free way to set up your online store. This allows you the freedom to focus on growing your business. </p> 
            <p>Think of it as a platform designed specifically for your ecommerce store with an army of hosting engineers working in the background. </p>

            <p>WooCommerce hosting sounds amazing but it has its own advantages and disadvantages. Before you make a decision, take a look at the pros and cons of WooCommerce hosting. </p> 
            <h3>Advantages of WooCommerce Hosting</h3> 
            <ul> 
             <li><strong>WooCommerce Ready</strong> – WooCommerce hosting companies offer pre-installed WooCommerce with a ready to use design to go with.</li> 
             <li><strong>High Performance</strong> – Speed is not just important for user experience but also for SEO. WooCommerce hosting platforms offer faster load times for smoother ecommerce transactions.</li> 
             <li><strong>Security</strong> – WooCommerce hosting plans come with SSL certificate. This adds a security layer around data transferring from customer’s browser to your website.</li> 
             <li><strong>WooCommerce Support</strong> We all need help now and then. With WooCommerce hosting you get help from actual WooCommerce experts via email, live chat, or phone.</li> 
             <li><strong>Hosting Features</strong> Apart from WooCommerce specific features, you get all the usual hosting features like unmetered bandwidth, huge disk space, email accounts, and more.</li> 
            </ul> 
            <p>Now you would probably think that this all sounds so amazing, what are the disadvantages? </p> 
            <h3>Disadvantages of WooCommerce Hosting</h3> 
            <ul> 
             <li><strong>Price</strong> – Prices for WooCommerce hosting plans are slightly higher than average shared WordPress hosting plans. </li> 
             <li><strong>Pre-Installed Software</strong> – Some advanced users may want to install WooCommerce on their own. Pre-installed software may also include WooCommerce ready designs and bonus extensions that some users may not need.</li> 
             <li><strong>Maintenance</strong> – Not all WooCommerce hosting plans offer automatic updates. You will still need to set up automated backups and install updates.</li> 
            </ul> 
            <p>Now that you have looked at the pros and cons of WooCommerce hosting, you are probably still wondering if its the right solution for you? </p> 
            <h4>When do you need WooCommerce Hosting?</h4> 
            <p>If you are a beginner and don’t intend to sell more than a couple of items, then you can go for a shared WordPress hosting account. We recommend using <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/" target="_blank" title="Bluehost" rel="nofollow">Bluehost</a>, they are one of the officially recommended WordPress hosting companies. </p> 
            <p>If you are a small business with intention to open a fully functional online store, then you would be better off with WooCommerce hosting. </p> 
            <p>Particularly if you don’t know the technical side of installing and setting up WordPress and WooCommerce, then choosing the right WooCommerce hosting will save you a lot of time.</p> 
            <p>As a business owner you have the option to go for a limited shared hosting plan and then hire someone to manage technical stuff or learn things as you go. This will take up your time and you’ll probably end up paying more than you expected. </p> 
            <p>Your second option is to go on the hassle free route with a WooCommerce hosting plan. You’ll have a blazing fast online store ready to go with no technical skills required. </p> 
            <p>In the end, it comes down to your own priorities. If keeping it low cost is most important factor then you can go for regular WordPress hosting. </p> 
            <p>On the other hand, if you want to start selling quickly, then the cost of WooCommerce hosting makes more sense and is easily justifiable. </p> 
            <p>Now that you have read all about choosing the WooCommerce hosting, it is time for you to make the decision. </p> 
            <p>As a WordPress resource site we have had the opportunity to work with several top hosting companies in the industry. After having helped 100,000+ users and years of experience, our founder Syed Balkhi have personally hand-picked the most well-reputed and top WooCommerce hosting companies for you. </p> 
            <p>Each of these WooCommerce hosting companies offer excellent performance, superior infrastructure, and knowledgeable support. We give each of them a perfect 5 out of 5 star rating. Check out the list of best WooCommerce hosting providers.</p>

         <h3 id="hosting-detailed">Detailed WooCommerce Hosting Performance Comparison</h3> 
         <p>The main reason why WPBeginner users trust us is because our reviews are based on actual usage, real-time tests, and accurate data. </p> 
         <p>Instead of using the information provided by hosting companies, we actually sign up for each WooCommerce hosting provider and thoroughly test their services. </p> 
         <p>We use professional third-party benchmarking tools like Pingdom, LoadImpact, and Bitcatcha. We run thorough tests for performance and reliability of each company, so we can help you choose the best WooCommerce hosting for your business.</p> 
         <p>For accurate testing across all WooCommerce hosting companies, we create a sample website on each hosting provider. After that we install a default theme and fill the site with dummy data including images and media. This way our tests resemble an average website. </p> 
         <p>Here is our step by step testing process: </p> 
         <p>First, we use Pingdom, an industry leading website speed test service, to measure our sample website speed across multiple WooCommerce hosting companies.</p> 
         <p>Next, we use Load Impact service to send virtual users (VU) to each website to see how the hosting server would handle increased requests from multiple connections at once. This helps us see how the individual WooCommerce hosting company would perform during peak traffic.</p> 
         <p>Last but not least, we use Bitcatcha service to test server response times across numerous geographical locations including United States, London, Singapore, Sao Paulo, India, Sydney, and Japan. This helps us decide which WooCommerce hosting is best for which geographical location.</p> 
         <p>Now that you know our test process, let’s compare the performance of the best WooCommerce hosting companies.</p> 
         <h4><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/siteground-woocommerce/" target="_blank" title="SiteGround" rel="nofollow">1. SiteGround</a></h4> 
         <p>SiteGround is one of the top-rated hosting company in the WooCommerce community. They provide unique in-house performance optimization and security which is why they’re an officially recommended WooCommerce hosting provider. WPBeginner site is also hosted on SiteGround.</p> 
         <p>Here are the results from our SiteGround performance tests:</p> 
         <p><img title="Speed test results for SiteGround" src="https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/speed-test-siteground.jpg" alt="Speed test results for SiteGround" width="610" height="243" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48914"></p> 
         <p>As you can see in the test result, our SiteGround test site loaded in less than a second (649 ms to be precise) for a server in Dallas, Texas. Our test site is faster than 95% of tested sites, which is incredible. </p> 
         <p>After that, we ran the Load Impact test on SiteGround servers. We gradually built up to 100 unique visitors at once to see how the server would handle increased requests from multiple connections at once.</p> 
         <p><img title="Load Impact test on Siteground" src="https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/loadimpact-siteground.jpg" alt="Load Impact test on Siteground" width="610" height="240" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48915"></p> 
         <p>In this chart, the blue line indicates the number of active virtual users on the site. The green line is the server load time. SiteGround performed almost consistently except for a spike at 50 users on the site. It quickly recovered and page load time remained steadily low even with more users.</p> 
         <p>Next, we ran response time test, we used Bitcatcha to test more accurate server response time from various geographical locations.</p> 
         <p><img title="SiteGround response time" src="https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/responsetime-siteground.png" alt="SiteGround response time" width="604" height="165" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48916"></p> 
         <p>Our SiteGround test site performed really well in the United States and all other locations except Japan.</p> 
         <p>If your audience is in Asia, then you can ask SiteGround to move you to their Asia-Pacific servers to remedy this.</p> 
         <p>In our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/hosting/siteground/" title="SiteGround">detailed SiteGround review</a>, we also evaluated their customer support, features, and pricing. </p> 
         <p>After our analysis, we find SiteGround to be a great option for WooCommerce hosting for startups because their support is incredibly helpful.</p>

         <p>Bluehost is one of the largest hosting companies in the world and an officially recommended WooCommerce hosting provider. </p> 
         <p>Here are the results from our Bluehost performance tests: </p> 
         <p><img title="Bluehost speed test results" src="https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluehost-speed-test.jpg" alt="Bluehost speed test results" width="610" height="231" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48908"></p> 
         <p>As you can see in the screenshot above, our test site loaded in less than two seconds. That’s faster than 85% of all tested websites. Considering that the test site wasn’t using any caching plugins or <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-performance-speed/" title="The Ultimate Guide to Boost WordPress Speed &amp; Performance">performance optimization tips</a>, this result is very good.</p> 
         <p>Next, we ran the Load Impact test on Bluehost site. We gradually built up to 100 unique visitors at once to see how the server would handle increased requests from multiple connections at once.</p> 
         <p>Here is the result screenshot:</p> 
         <p><img title="Bluehost LoadImpact test result" src="https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/loadimpact-bluehost.jpg" alt="Bluehost LoadImpact test result" width="610" height="237" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48910"></p> 
         <p>In this chart, the blue line indicates number of active virtual users on the site, and the green line is the server load time. As you can see the server load remained stable through out the test even at peak traffic.</p> 
         <p>In the next phase, we used Bitcatcha to test server response time more accurately from different geographical locations.</p> 
         <p><img title="Bluehost response time test" src="https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bluehost-responsetime-test.png" alt="Bluehost response time test" width="609" height="172" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48911"></p> 
         <p>Response times for our Bluehost test site were exceptionally great in the United States loading under a fraction of a second. Response time in other locations was a bit higher but still under less than a second.</p> 
         <p>If your target customers are in the United States, then this would hugely benefit your WooCommerce store. </p> 
         <p>We also evaluated their customer support, features, and pricing in our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/hosting/bluehost/" title="Bluehost">detailed Bluehost review</a>. After this thorough analysis, we believe that Bluehost is a great WooCommerce hosting provider to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-start-an-online-store/" title="How to Start an Online Store in 2020 (Step by Step)">start your online store</a>. </p>

         <p>WP Engine is one of the most popular managed WordPress and WooCommerce hosting provider. They offer in-house performance optimization, managed updates. 1-click staging environment, and more. </p> 
         <p>Here are the results from our WP Engine performance tests:</p>

         <p>As you can see, our test site loaded in less than a second for a server in New York City, NY. That’s faster than 96% of all tested sites. Considering that we didn’t need to install any performance optimization this result is quite good. </p> 
         <p>But how does WP Engine performs under traffic? </p> 
         <p>We ran the Load Impact test on WP Engine server where we gradually built up to 100 unique visitors at once to see how the server would handle increased requests from multiple connections at once.</p> 
         <p><img title="WP Engine Load Impact test" src="https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wpengine-loadimpact.png" alt="WP Engine Load Impact test" width="550" height="207" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48923"></p> 
         <p>The green line represents page load time and the blue line represents number of users on the site. As you can see, our test site performed really well up to 80 users, after that it started to slow down.</p> 
         <p>As you can see in the chart, that WP Engine server performance remained steady throughout the test as the numbers of users increased. </p> 
         <p>After the load impact test, we used Bitcatcha to test more accurate server response time from various geographical locations.</p> 
         <p><img title="WP Engine response time" src="https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wpengine-resposetime.png" alt="WP Engine response time" width="550" height="165" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48924"></p> 
         <p>As you can see in the results, WP Engine server response time remained under less than half a second on all geographic locations. It was particularly great in the United States. </p> 
         <p>In our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/hosting/wpengine/" title="WP Engine">detailed WP Engine review</a>, we also evaluated their customer support, features, and pricing. After our analysis, we find WP Engine to be the best option for managed WordPress and WooCommerce hosting.</p>

          <li><strong>PROS:</strong> Optimized for WordPress and WooCommerce with a stable managed hosting platform</li> 
          <li><strong>PROS:</strong> 1-click staging environment, free SSL, and integrated support to add CDN service as an addon</li>

         <p>Liquid Web is another popular choice among the WooCommerce and WordPress community. They offer multiple levels of WooCommerce hosting plans including VPS, cloud sites, managed, and dedicated plans with 24/7 support. </p> 
         <p>Here are the test results from our Liquid Web performance tests: </p>

         <p>As you can see in the test result, our Liquid Web test site loaded in less than a second for a server in San Jose, California. That means our site is faster than 91% of tested sites.</p> 
         <p>Next, we ran the Load Impact test on Liquid Web servers where we gradually built up to 100 unique visitors at once to see how the server would handle increased requests from multiple connections at once.</p> 
         <p><img title="Load Impact test on Liquid Web" src="https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/liquidweb-loadimpact.png" alt="Load Impact test on Liquid Web" width="550" height="206" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48920"></p> 
         <p>The blue line is the number of active virtual users on the site, and the green line is the server load time. As you can see the server load remained stable through out the test even at peak traffic.</p> 
         <p>After that, we ran response times test to see how fast Liquid Web servers respond to requests from different geographic locations. </p>

         <h4><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hostgator/" target="_blank" title="HostGator" rel="nofollow">5. HostGator</a></h4> 
         <p>HostGator is one of the top web hosting companies. They host over 8 million domains. WPBeginner website is hosted on HostGator dedicated servers, and we have been using them since 2007 for our various websites.</p> 
         <p>Here are the results from our HostGator performance tests:</p> 
         <p><img title="HostGator speed Test" src="https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/speedtest-hostgator.jpg" alt="HostGator speed Test" width="610" height="238" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48925"></p> 
         <p>As you can see in the screenshot, our test site loaded in just under a second for a server in Dallas, Texas. That’s faster than 94% of all tested sites. Considering that our test site wasn’t using any caching plugins or performance optimization tips, this result is great.</p> 
         <p>Next, we wanted to test how does HostGator perform during peak traffic?</p> 
         <p>We ran the Load Impact test on HostGator servers. We gradually built up to 100 unique visitors at once to see how the server would handle increased requests from multiple connections at once.</p> 
         <p><img title="Load Impact result for HostGator" src="https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/loadimpact-hostgator.jpg" alt="Load Impact result for HostGator" width="610" height="237" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48926"></p> 
         <p>In this chart the green line indicates page load time and the blue line represents number of users on the site. As you can see, our test site performed really well up to 80 users, after that it started to slow down.</p> 
         <p>It is quite normal for shared hosting environments as you share server resources with other sites on the server. As your WooCommerce store grows you’ll need to move to VPS or managed hosting providers. </p> 
         <p>Next, we tested the server response time from different geographic locations. We used Bitcatcha to test more accurate server response time. </p> 
         <p><img title="HostGator response time" src="https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcatcha-hostgator.png" alt="HostGator response time" width="603" height="167" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48927"></p> 
         <p>As you can see our test site responded in less than a second for all locations. In the United States, the response time was merely 37 ms. </p> 
         <p>We also evaluated HostGator’s customer service, pricing, and features in our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/hosting/hostgator/" title="HostGator">detailed HostGator review</a>. </p> 
         <ul>

          <li><strong>CONS:</strong> No free domain and renewal fees are higher</li> 
         </ul>

         <h3>WooCommerce Hosting FAQs</h3> 
         <p>Having helped thousands of users, we have heard just about every hosting question. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about WooCommerce hosting: </p> 
         <p><strong>Do I need WooCommerce hosting to start an online store?</strong></p> 
         <p>If you are building an online store with WooCommerce, then you’ll need WooCommerce hosting. Hosting is the place where all your website’s files are stored. Every website and online store uses a hosting provider. </p> 
         <p><strong>Can I install WooCommerce on my shared WordPress hosting account?</strong> </p> 
         <p>Yes, you can. However, shared WordPress hosting plans are designed to cater the needs of small business and personal websites. WooCommerce is a transactional app that needs more resources particularly when you have more than a hundred customers on your website. This is why you need a WooCommerce hosting plan, so that you can run your online store without any downtime and at faster speeds.</p> 
         <p><strong>Are there any free WooCommerce hosting providers?</strong> </p> 
         <p>None that we are aware of. Even if you find a free WooCommerce hosting, we will strongly recommend that you stay away from them. In most cases, free hosting providers put advertisements on your website. They may even distribute malware to your customers. Last but not least, they can shut down your website at anytime without any notification. Avoid anyone who offers to give you free hosting, specially if you are serious about your site.</p> 
         <p><strong>How much does it cost to build an online store with WooCommerce?</strong> </p> 
         <p>The total cost of your WooCommerce store is calculated based on hosting costs, domain name, and SSL certificate. The cost of maintaining your online store grows as your business grows. We have created a detailed guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-wordpress-website/" title="How Much Does It Really Cost to Build a WordPress Website?">how much does it cost to build a website</a>, jump to the ecommerce section for tips on keeping your costs down. </p> 
         <p><strong>I already purchased a domain. Can I use it with my WooCommerce hosting?</strong> </p> 
         <p>Yes, you can. Once you purchase a domain name, you are free to use it with any hosting company. All you need to do is go to your domain settings and point its DNS to your WooCommerce hosting company. Each of our top WooCommerce hosting companies have step by step instructions on how to do that. See our guide on the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/whats-the-difference-between-domain-name-and-web-hosting-explained/" title="What’s the Difference Between Domain Name and Web Hosting (Explained)">difference between domain name and web hosting</a>. </p> 
         <p><strong>Do I need to buy domain and WooCommerce hosting from same company?</strong> </p> 
         <p>No you don’t. You can buy a domain name from one company and WooCommerce hosting from another. However, it does help to get them from the same company as you will not have to change DNS settings, and you will be able to manage your domain and hosting under the same dashboard. </p> 
         <p><strong>Do I need to buy any addons when signing up for WooCommerce hosting?</strong> </p> 
         <p>During the sign up process, some hosting companies will offer to sell you add-on services. You can safely uncheck them as they would add to the cost of your hosting bill. </p> 
         <p>Later on, if you feel you need one of these add-on services, then you can simply add them to your hosting plan from your account dashboard. </p> 
         <p><strong>How many customers can these WooCommerce hosting companies handle?</strong></p> 
         <p>All hosting companies in our best WooCommerce hosting list handle millions of pageviews every day. They are all equipped to handle smaller stores as well as large online stores even during peak holiday shopping traffic. </p> 
         <p>The traffic your site can handle largely depends on the plan you choose. With shared WooCommerce hosting providers like Bluehost, SiteGround, and HostGator, your website will be able to handle 1,000 – 5,000 visitors a day with speed optimization. </p> 
         <p>With managed hosting providers, you should be able to handle as much traffic as you need because their team would automatically scale your account as needed.</p> 
         <p><strong>Do WooCommerce hosting companies keep backups of my site?</strong> </p> 
         <p>Yes, many of them do. However, we don’t recommend relying on your hosting company’s backups. You must always create your own backups by using a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/7-best-wordpress-backup-plugins-compared-pros-and-cons/" title="7 Best WordPress Backup Plugins Compared (Pros and Cons)">WordPress backup plugin</a>. </p> 
         <p><strong>Can I change my WooCommerce hosting later?</strong> </p> 
         <p>Yes, you can totally change your WooCommerce hosting company if you are unhappy with them. Most hosting companies offer migration services that you can utilize with minimum downtime. You can also move your website on your own, see our guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-move-wordpress-to-a-new-host-or-server-with-no-downtime/" title="How to Move WordPress to a New Host or Server With No Downtime">how to move a WordPress site to new host</a>. </p> 
         <p><strong>What are the best WooCommerce hosting companies in your opinion?</strong> </p>
