          <p>The goal of Khan Academy Kids is to help young learners everywhere learn to read, thrive in a classroom, count, be creative, ask questions, and—above all—build a love of learning. When we launched Khan Academy Kids in 2018, we wanted to help kids from all backgrounds and all walks of life be kindergarten ready. This spring many of the children who are using our app will graduate from kindergarten and move on to first grade. We’re excited to be able to continue the learning journey with them by providing first-grade lessons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Like the rest of the app, our new first-grade lessons are designed with a whole-child focus. Our program engages kids in core subjects like early literacy, reading, writing, language, and math, while encouraging creativity and building social-emotional skills. Khan Academy Kids is aligned with Common Core standards and the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, and it was developed in collaboration with education experts at Stanford University.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The new first-grade lessons are available now on the Khan Academy Kids. The app is 100% free with no ads, in-app purchases, or subscriptions. Download the app today on iOS or Android.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Overall, Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy is the top choice of students preparing for the SAT. In a 2019 survey of more than 65,000 SAT test takers, nearly four times as many students said they practiced with Official SAT Practice than paid for commercial test prep.</p>
          <p>“Official SAT Practice has achieved remarkable reach since its launch five years ago,” said College Board CEO David Coleman. “The fact that 10 million students have accessed high quality SAT practice resources without paying a dollar is exactly why we partnered with Khan Academy. Every student deserves the opportunity to practice for and succeed on the SAT, no matter what their family’s income level.”</p>
          <p>College Board and Khan Academy are committed to supporting teachers across the country to help their students make the most of Official SAT Practice free resources.</p>
          <p>“What’s really exciting is the level of usage we’ve seen in classrooms,” said Khan Academy founder Sal Khan. “Official SAT Practice was designed to be powerful for individual students preparing on their own, but this can be supercharged when it’s leveraged in a classroom setting where students get support from peers and teachers.”&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Khan noted teachers are the heart of the classroom and know what’s best for their students. “They know how to help students on the path to college,” he said. “We’re grateful for everything teachers do every day to help students achieve their dreams.”</p>

          <p>The College Board is celebrating the 10 million sign-up milestone during SAT Practice Kickoff Week January 27-31, 2020 with a campaign to encourage high school students to join the movement and create their own Official SAT Practice accounts.

          <p>“I highly recommend <a href="https://rangerrick.org/magazines/"><i>Ranger Rick</i> (and <i>Ranger Rick Jr</i>)</a> and<i> <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/subscribe/kids-magazines-bundle_search?ds_rl=1265457&amp;ds_rl=1274719&amp;ds_rl=1265457&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIu-vY3rKh5gIViPhkCh1lYAKgEAAYASAAEgJApvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">National Geographic Kids</a></i> magazine subscriptions.”<br>Anna Berns,<br>Program manager, international content / localization community liaison</p>
          <p><b>Kiwi Crates</b></p>
          <p>“I like giving <a href="https://www.kiwico.com/">Kiwi Crates</a>, which are great for the five- to eight-year-olds in my life, but Kiwi Co. also has crates for different age groups. I like giving these crates because each one includes super fun, hands-on STEAM projects with associated science and math instruction. I like to give a monthly subscription so they are a gift that keeps on giving.”<br>Megan Cohn,<br>Biology content creator</p>

          <h2><b>Books</b></h2>
          <p>The Khan Academy content team loves to give books as gifts to encourage relationship building and independent learning.</p>
          <p><b>A board book for babies</b></p>
          <p>“I always give board books as part of my baby shower gifts because the first thing a child should learn about a book is that it helps to build relationships.”<br>Charlotte Auen,<br>Content creator, math</p>
          <p><b>Pre-K through elementary</b></p>
          <p>“<a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781328470386">The book <i>Lottie and Walter</i></a> is good for pre-K to third grade—a story about overcoming fear and believing in yourself.<br><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780763680909"><i>The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane</i></a> is a great book to read aloud to young elementary kids or to give as an independent read for older kids. It’s a beautiful story about how we change for the better if we open our hearts up.”<br>Allison Leedie,<br>Content creator, English language arts</p>
          <p>“My six-year-old daughter loves <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250035851"><i>Bedtime Math</i></a> so much she wakes me up in the morning to do more of it. The problems are engaging. Each one has three levels of difficulty, so kids of different ages and math readiness can all engage.”<br>Vicki Lang,<br>Senior content manager, math</p>
          <p><b>Middle school recommendations</b></p>
          <p>“I would gift puzzle mystery books! They’re a fun way to stretch your brain and fuel your curiosity. Plus, there’s nothing more fun than solving a mystery before the main character does. My favorites: <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780142401200"><i>The Westing Game</i></a> by Ellen Raskin,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780307931474"><i>Escape from Mr. Lemoncello’s Library</i></a> by Chris Grabenstein, and <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780439372978"><i>Chasing Vermeer</i></a> by Blue Balliett.”<br>Kim Elliott,<br>Senior content creator, humanities</p>
          <p>“<a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780547258300"><i>Graceling</i></a> is for middle school and up. It’s just a great epic fantasy novel with amazing characters to root for.”<br>Allison Leedie,<br>Content creator, English language arts</p>
          <p><b>HIgh school and beyond</b></p>
          <p><i>“<a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781596914520/Apostolos-Doxiadis/Logicomix">Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth</a></i> is a graphic novel about Bertrand Russell’s quest for fortifying the logical foundations of mathematics. This amazing book brings out the humanity in the most abstract science of them all.<br><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781107534056"><i>Proofs and Refutations</i></a> by Imre Lakatos is a harder read and more appropriate for people who have grappled with proving theorems before. Nevertheless, it read like a thriller to me. The book is a Socratic dialogue between a teacher and some students about a proof of a famous theorem and its related definitions, which touches upon the nature of mathematical discovery.”<br>Tomer Gal,<br>Content creator, math</p>

          <h2><b>Games and toys </b></h2>
          <p>A lot of learning can happen when playing the games and toys picked by our content team. Adults will enjoy these picks, too!</p>
          <p><b>Guess Who? game</b></p>
          <p>“<a href="https://shop.hasbro.com/en-us/product/guess-who-classic-game:7DEC61D9-5056-9047-F55F-FC686C17D23F">Guess Who? is a great educational game</a> for elementary ages and up for practicing categorizing, questioning, and noticing. You can swap out the characters and create new game sheets with historical figures, quadratic graphs, or elements from the periodic table — really anything that has similarities and unique features that you want children to discover. The game, as is or with modified characters, works in any language.”<br>Charlotte Auen,<br>Content creator, math</p>
          <p><b>QWIXX and Rat-a-tat Cat</b></p>
          <p>“Both <a href="https://gamewright.com/product/Qwixx">QWIXX </a>(dice) are and <a href="https://gamewright.com/product/Rat-a-Tat-Cat">Rat-a-tat Cat</a> (cards) are quick to play and a lot of fun. Also, they are great strategic games for elementary-age kids but are fun for everyone!”<br>Lindsay Spears,<br>Senior content creator, math</p>
          <p><b>U.S. Presidents Playing Cards and Women Cards</b></p>
          <p>“Most kids can’t name all of the presidents, so <a href="https://eugenetoyandhobby.com/shop/bicycle-u-s-presidents-playing-cards/">the U.S. Presidents Playing Cards</a> are a good way to remember faces and names. They are also organized in order of succession, so kids could memorize the order just by playing with them if they were playing solitaire or something similar. I also really like the <a href="https://www.thewomancards.com/products/the-woman-cards-tech-deck">Women Cards Tech Deck</a>.”<br>Leah Marquez,<br>Content creator, social studies</p>
          <p><b>Perplexus Original</b></p>
          <p>“I love the <a href="http://www.spinmastergames.com/game-detail.php?pid=p10380">Perplexus</a>. It is a 3-D puzzle that my kids have spent countless hours on.”<br>Lindsay Spears,<br>Senior content creator, math</p>
