           <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins_of_the_Board">Origins of the Board</span></h2> 
           <p>The introduction of gunpowder to Europe led to innovations in offensive weapons, such as cannon, and defences, such as fortifications. From the 1320s a member of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Households_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Royal Households of the United Kingdom">Royal Household</a>, the 'Keeper of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_Wardrobe" title="Privy Wardrobe">Privy Wardrobe</a> in the Tower of London', became increasingly responsible for the procurement, storage and distribution of weapons. His office and main arsenal were located in the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Tower_(Tower_of_London)" title="White Tower (Tower of London)">White Tower</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> This 'Privy Wardrobe in the Tower' grew, both in size and significance, after the start of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War" title="Hundred Years' War">Hundred Years' War</a>. </p>
           <p>In the following century, the influence of the Privy Wardrobe and its staff receded and no new Keepers were appointed after 1476. In its place a distinct <b>Office of Ordnance</b> began to establish itself at the Tower, responsible for firearms and artillery and staffed in the 1460s by a Master, a Clerk and a Yeoman.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tomlinson79_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Tomlinson79-4">[4]</a></sup> In the 1540s, under <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>, the Ordnance Office was expanded, new officers were appointed and their principal duties clarified. </p>
           <p>In 1671, the Office of Ordnance took over the work of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Armouries" title="Royal Armouries">Office of Armoury</a> at the Tower (a parallel body originally responsible for armour and <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edged_weapons" title="Edged weapons">edged weapons</a> but whose activities had gradually widened causing a degree of duplication).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> At this time the Ordnance Office also began to take on oversight of the nation's forts and fortifications. In 1683 the board of management (first assembled in 1597) was formally constituted as the <b>Board of Ordnance</b> by Warrant of King Charles II; it consisted of five Principal Officers meeting under the chairmanship of the Master-General. At the same time it was given a new constitution ('Instructions') by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Legge,_1st_Baron_Dartmouth" title="George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth">Lord Dartmouth</a>, the Master-General. These detailed Instructions continued, with relatively little change, to provide the working framework for the Board and its officers until the early 19th century.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tomlinson79_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-Tomlinson79-4">[4]</a></sup> The Board was a decision-making body, answerable to the Master-General who had power of veto. (He was also empowered to act independently of the Board). They were required to meet at least twice a week (8am every Tuesday and Thursday) at the Tower in order to transact business. </p>

           <p>By the mid-16th century the Master was assisted by five 'Principal Officers' who later went on to form the Board, which thus consisted of: </p>
           <p>Two overseers: </p>

           </ul> 
           <p>The offices of Master of the Ordnance and Clerk of the Ordnance may be said to date from 1414, when Letters Patent were issued on behalf of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England" title="Henry V of England">Henry V of England</a> to 'Nicholas Merbury, Master of our Works, Engines, Cannons and other kinds of Ordnance for War, and to John Louth, Clerk of the same Works'<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-arrows_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-arrows-2">[2]</a></sup> (though it appears that these were appointments for service in the field of war rather than to a permanent position).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tomlinson79_4-2"><a href="#cite_note-Tomlinson79-4">[4]</a></sup> Merbury was present at the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Harfleur" title="Siege of Harfleur">Siege of Harfleur</a> and (albeit without his guns) at the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt" title="Battle of Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> By 1450 Master of Ordnance was a permanent appointment, firmly based at the Tower of London. </p>
           <p>The office of Yeoman of the Ordnance (established in 1430 to oversee both the storage of weapons and accoutrements and their delivery for use in the field) was abolished in 1543 and its duties split between two new officers: the Storekeeper of the Ordnance and Clerk of the Deliveries.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Sharpe93_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sharpe93-8">[8]</a></sup> At the same time the office of Surveyor of the Ordnance was also established. </p>
           <p>Until 1544 the Master had generally managed the day-to-day activities of the Ordnance Office. In that year, however, <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Henry_VIII" title="King Henry VIII">King Henry VIII</a> appointed his brother-in-law <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Seymour,_1st_Baron_Seymour_of_Sudeley" title="Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley">Thomas Seymour</a> as Master of the Ordnance, displacing the incumbent <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Morris_(Master_of_the_Ordnance)" title="Christopher Morris (Master of the Ordnance)">Sir Christopher Morris</a>, who continued his previous work but with a new title: Lieutenant of the Ordnance. Thereafter the Lieutenant (or Lieutenant-General) had day-to-day oversight of the Board's activities, while Master (or Master-General) had more the role of a statesman and supervisor (albeit still with specific responsibilities to the Board and its work).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tomlinson79_4-3"><a href="#cite_note-Tomlinson79-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
           <p>From the 17th century through till 1828 the Master-General routinely had a seat in <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(United_Kingdom)" title="Cabinet (United Kingdom)">Cabinet</a>, and thus served as <i>de facto</i> principal military adviser to the government. Some of the most illustrious soldiers of their generation served as Master-General: <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough" title="John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough">Marlborough</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cadogan,_1st_Earl_Cadogan" title="William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan">Cadogan</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis" title="Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis">Cornwallis</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Rawdon-Hastings,_1st_Marquess_of_Hastings" title="Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings">Hastings</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Wellington</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hardinge,_1st_Viscount_Hardinge" title="Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge">Hardinge</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-arrows_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-arrows-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
           <p>While the offices of Master-General and Lieutenant-General were almost always filled by prominent soldiers, the Ordnance Office was a largely civilian organisation up until the formation of its Artillery and Engineer corps in the early 18th century. Prior to 1716, civilians were generally employed as gunners and engineers by the Board; Storekeepers and their subordinates were also civilians (and remained so through till the Board's demise in the 1850s) as were those engaged in manufacturing. Having established the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Artillery" title="Royal Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Engineers" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>, however, the Board had parallel oversight of both a Military and a Civil Establishment. The Master-General was head of both Establishments; on a practical level, the Lieutenant-General had day-to-day oversight of the military personnel and the Surveyor-General oversaw the civil departments.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Roper1998_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Roper1998-9">[9]</a></sup> </p> 
           <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_personnel">Other personnel</span></h3> 
           <p>From its earliest years, the Ordnance Office was staffed by a large number of Clerks to manage its substantial administrative functions. A number of other officials reported to the board, including furbishers, proofmasters, keepers and fireworkers. </p>
           <p>Two appointments stand out, as they (like the six Board members) were appointed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_Patent" title="Letters Patent">Letters Patent</a> under the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm" title="Great Seal of the Realm">Great Seal of the Realm</a>: namely the <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Gunner" title="Master Gunner">Master Gunner</a> of England and the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Royal_Engineer" title="Chief Royal Engineer">Chief Engineer</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tomlinson79_4-4"><a href="#cite_note-Tomlinson79-4">[4]</a></sup> These were the senior technicians on the staff. The appointment of Master Gunner was first made as early as 1485, though it ceased after the establishment of the Regiment of Artillery in the 18th century; that of Chief Engineer was instituted in 1660. </p>
           <p>The <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer_of_the_Ordnance" title="Treasurer of the Ordnance">Treasurer of the Ordnance</a> was another important officer of the department, although he did not sit on the board.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tomlinson79_4-5"><a href="#cite_note-Tomlinson79-4">[4]</a></sup> This office was instituted in 1670 (its duties having previously been discharged by the Lieutenant-General); the post was consolidated with several others in 1836 to form that of <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paymaster-General" title="Paymaster-General">Paymaster-General</a>. </p>
           <p>The <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Naval_Ordnance" title="Master of Naval Ordnance">Master of Naval Ordnance</a> was a specific office established in 1546 who was assigned to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_Marine" title="Council of the Marine">Council of the Marine</a> and acted as a liaison between both boards.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> </p>
           <p>The Board also had a network of officers in place in key forts, ordnance yards and other installations throughout the Realm (including overseas). The senior Ordnance officer in these locations was usually termed the Storekeeper, and he was responsible directly to the Board. Prior to the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_the_Crowns" title="Union of the Crowns">Union of the Crowns</a> there was a Master of the Ordnance in the North (with oversight of Berwick, Newcastle and the nearby coastal forts) who had greater autonomy, though he was reliant on the London office for most supplies.

           <p>In the medieval period, storage and supply of weapons and armaments was the responsibility of the King's <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardrobe_(government)" title="Wardrobe (government)">Wardrobe</a>. Royal palaces (including the Tower of London) were therefore used for storage of armour, weapons and (in time) gunpowder. When the Office of Ordnance came into being, the Tower of London was already established as the main repository, and it remained the administrative centre of the new Board. Gunpowder was stored in the White Tower (and continued to be kept there until the mid-19th century). Small arms, ammunition, armour and other equipment were stored elsewhere within the Tower precinct, a succession of Storehouses and Armouries having been built for such purposes since the fourteenth century. From the mid-16th century bulkier items began to be stored in warehouses in the nearby <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minories" title="Minories">Minories</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Stewart96_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Stewart96-11">[11]</a></sup> and cannons were <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_test" title="Proof test">proof-tested</a> on the '<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Artillery_Ground" title="Old Artillery Ground">Old Artillery Ground</a>' to the north. </p>
           <p>Within the Tower, the New Armouries of 1664 served the Board as a small arms store (it can still be seen today in the Inner Ward). The vast Grand Storehouse of 1692 served not just as a store, but also as a museum of ordnance, precursor to today's <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Armouries" title="Royal Armouries">Royal Armouries</a>. (It was destroyed (along with its contents, some 60,000 objects) in a fire in 1841).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> </p>

           <p>In the mid-17th century the Board began to use land at Woolwich for storing and proving its guns. The land (known as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Arsenal" title="Royal Arsenal">The Warren</a>) was purchased in 1671 and in 1682 a thousand cannons and ten thousand cannonballs were transferred to Woolwich from the Tower and the Minories. At the same time, the Old Artillery Ground was sold and the staff and equipment involved in proof testing moved to Woolwich.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-arrows_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-arrows-2">[2]</a></sup> From 1688 all new ordnance items were ordered to be delivered to Woolwich rather than the Tower (thereafter the Tower continued to be used as the Board's main repository for general stores).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> </p>
           <p>The Woolwich Warren (later renamed the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Arsenal" title="Royal Arsenal">Royal Arsenal</a>) continued to serve as Britain's principal ordnance depot until the mid-twentieth century. It also developed into a major manufacturing site (see below). </p>

           <p>The Board established storage and maintenance areas close to the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy_Dockyard" title="Royal Navy Dockyard">Royal Dockyards</a> to enable easy transfer of guns, ammunition, powder, etc. on board ships (for use by the Navy at sea or for delivery to the Army in areas of conflict). They also provided ordnance supplies for the defensive fortifications of the Dockyard itself, and secure storage space for ships in port (Royal Naval ships returning from duties at sea were obliged to unload their stores of powder and ammunition; if a ship was to spend time '<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_ordinary" title="In ordinary">in ordinary</a>' (i.e. out of commission) it had its guns removed as well). </p>
           <p>In the 16th century the Ordnance Office had established 'annexes' in Chatham, Deptford and Woolwich; others were to follow in the vicinity of the other major Dockyards. These facilities, generally known as Gun Wharves, developed into purpose-built Ordnance Yards in the course of the 18th century. Built alongside deep-water quays, they usually comprised an assortment of buildings for storage, administration blocks, workshops (for woodwork, paintwork and metalwork) together with accommodation for officers, usually built around a central Grand Storehouse (primarily used for gun carriages). Exterior courtyards were laid out for the storage of cannonballs.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> </p>

           <p>Ordnance Yards were also constructed in colonial ports overseas; like their counterparts in Britain, these were usually built in the vicinity of naval dockyards. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Naval_Dockyard,_Bermuda" title="Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda">Bermuda's</a>, begun in the 1830s, remains largely intact behind the dockyard fortifications; its magazines and storehouses are arranged around a small pool, where boats would arrive by way of a tunnel through the ramparts to be loaded with ammunition.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Coad2013_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-Coad2013-24">[24]</a></sup> </p> 
           <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Gunpowder_storage">Gunpowder storage</span></h4> 
           <p>For storage of gunpowder, a nearby fortified building was often used initially: the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Tower" title="Square Tower">Square Tower</a> at Portsmouth, the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Citadel,_Plymouth" title="Royal Citadel, Plymouth">Citadel</a> at Plymouth, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upnor_Castle" title="Upnor Castle">Upnor Castle</a> at Chatham; later, the Ordnance Board created purpose-built <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_magazine" title="Gunpowder magazine">Gunpowder Magazines</a>, often apart from the Yards, and at a safe distance from inhabited areas.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-m.english-heritage.org.uk_23-1"><a href="#cite_note-m.english-heritage.org.uk-23">[23]</a></sup> There were also smaller magazines, supervised by Ordnance Board staff, at several fortified locations around the British Isles (from <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Castle,_Isles_of_Scilly" title="Star Castle, Isles of Scilly">Star Castle</a> on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilly_Isles" title="Scilly Isles">Scilly Isles</a>, to <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_George,_Scotland" title="Fort George, Scotland">Fort George</a> near <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness" title="Inverness">Inverness</a>). </p>
           <p>The Tower of London remained the main, central repository until 1694, when a new gunpowder depot was established on the banks of the Thames at <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Peninsula" title="Greenwich Peninsula">Greenwich Peninsula</a>. The location was chosen both for reasons of safety (it was largely uninhabited marshland) and for convenience (because gunpowder barrels were invariably delivered by boat). The powder arrived at Greenwich from the manufacturers. Once there it was not only stored, prior to being despatched to wherever it might be needed, but a sample from each batch was <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_test" title="Proof test">proof tested</a>.

           <p>Very soon, however, the Board was coming under pressure from local residents to remove the gunpowder store from Greenwich. Eventually, in 1763, a new set of magazines were built, along with a new proof-house, further downriver at <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purfleet" title="Purfleet">Purfleet</a>. Named the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_magazine#Purfleet,_Essex" title="Gunpowder magazine">Royal Gunpowder Magazine</a>, it was likewise used as a central store, to receive and approve gunpowder from the manufacturers prior to distribution around the country. (Soon afterwards the Greenwich magazine closed, and it was later demolished.) </p>
           <p>At around the same time, significant improvements were made to the gunpowder depots at the Dockyards (where the Board was still often using old buildings in built-up areas). New purpose-built storage facilities were constructed close to the principal Dockyards at Portsmouth (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priddy%27s_Hard" title="Priddy's Hard">Priddy's Hard</a>) and Devonport (Keyham Point), and at Chatham the Upnor facility was (eventually) expanded. These centres continued to grow, as the processes for refining and preserving gunpowder became more complicated and as new explosives began to be used, requiring their own storage and maintenance areas. </p>
           <p>In 1850, Devonport's magazine depot was moved from Keyham to a new complex at Bull Point (where it was integrated with a nearby proofing and purifying facility) - this proved to be the last major construction project of the Board of Ordnance before its disestablishment. </p> 
           <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_items">Other items</span></h4> 
           <p>The Board of Ordnance was responsible, throughout its existence, for supplying the Army and Navy with weapons and ammunition. Other items were provided by various other boards and agencies (or, in earlier times, by private contractors). From 1822, however, the Board was given responsibility for sourcing, storing and supplying a variety of other items for the Army, including tents and camp equipment (formerly the remit of the Army's Storekeeper-General) and 'barrack stores' (for which the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissariat#British_Army" title="Commissariat">Commissariat</a> had been responsible since 1807). Later, in 1834, the Board inherited (also from the Commissariat) the task of providing food and 'fuel' (namely coal and candles for use in barracks) for all homeland troops, as well as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forage" title="Forage">forage</a> for cavalry regiments.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Roper1998_9-1"><a href="#cite_note-Roper1998-9">[9]</a></sup> </p>

           <p>Prior to the 18th century the Board had generally relied on private contracts for the provision of armaments: small arms often came from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Gun_Quarter" title="Birmingham Gun Quarter">Birmingham Gun Quarter</a>, gunpowder from <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faversham_explosives_industry" title="Faversham explosives industry">Faversham</a> (also, later, from <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltham_Abbey_(town)" title="Waltham Abbey (town)">Waltham Abbey</a>).

Around the year 1635, a Francis Coningsby was appointed 'Commissary-General of all His Majesty's Castles in England and Wales'. From 1660 the title was Engineer-in-Chief. The Chief Engineer had responsibility for drawing up designs, supervising site surveys and building works, and visiting established defence sites to evaluate their state of repair, readiness etc. An illustrious holder of this post was <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Bernard_de_Gomme" title="Sir Bernard de Gomme">Sir Bernard de Gomme</a>. In 1802 the post of Inspector General of Fortifications was established, and this official took over supervision of these works.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> </p> 
           <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Barracks">Barracks</span></h4> 
           <p>The Board also had responsibility for the building, upkeep and management of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks" title="Barracks">barracks</a> and associated structures (except during a 30-year period, 1792-1822, when responsibility was transferred to a separate Barrack Office).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> Before this time, barracks were a rarity in mainland Britain and (other than those attached to royal residences) they were generally only found within <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison" title="Garrison">garrisoned</a> fortifications. In the wake of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, however, there was a spate of barrack building and the new post of Barrackmaster-General was established to oversee it; he was answerable not to the Board of Ordnance but to the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_at_War" title="Secretary at War">Secretary at War</a>. (The Board, though, retained responsibility for providing and provisioning barracks for its own corps). Apparent mismanagement in the Barrack Office led to a series of inquiries, however, and following the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> responsibility for barracks was returned to the Board of Ordnance.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Roper1998_9-2"><a href="#cite_note-Roper1998-9">[9]</a></sup> </p> 
           <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Personnel:_the_Ordnance_Corps">Personnel: the Ordnance Corps</span></h3> 
           <p>A number of different Corps were established by the Board of Ordnance to carry out its work both in its home establishments and on the field of battle; they had (and to some extent retain) a very distinctive identity and ethos. Principal among these were the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Artillery" title="Royal Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> and the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Engineers" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>. These Corps were under the authority of the Board of Ordnance, rather than the War Office (until the Board's demise in 1855). They were not part of the Army, and their officers' commissions were issued by the Master-General of the Ordnance rather than by the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-Chief_of_the_Forces" title="Commander-in-Chief of the Forces">Commander-in-Chief of the Forces</a>. The Ordnance Medical Department was established to provide surgeons for these corps. </p> 
           <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Royal_Artillery">Royal Artillery</span></h4> 
           <p>In 1716 the Duke of Marlborough, in his capacity as Master General of the Ordnance, oversaw the formation (by Royal Warrant) of two permanent companies of field artillery, based (together with their guns) at the Warren (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Arsenal" title="Royal Arsenal">Royal Arsenal</a>), Woolwich. Prior to this, <a class="mw-redirect" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_piece" title="Artillery piece">artillery pieces</a> had been conveyed to the front line in any conflict by <i>ad hoc</i> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_(military)" title="Train (military)">artillery trains</a> (their personnel convened for a limited duration by Royal Warrant). The men of the new artillery companies (which became the Royal Regiment of Artillery from 1722) now provided troops for this purpose; before long, they were also providing guns and heavy artillery for forts and garrisons around the country and indeed across the Empire. In addition, the Artillerymen did on-site work at the Arsenal and at other Ordnance Board facilities, from preparing fuses and proving weapons to providing a guard. 1793 saw the formation of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Horse_Artillery" title="Royal Horse Artillery">Royal Horse Artillery</a> (who were likewise under the authority of the Board of Ordnance) to provide artillery support to the Cavalry.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> </p> 
           <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Royal_Engineers">Royal Engineers</span></h4> 
           <p>From the start, the Board (and its predecessor the Office) of Ordnance had had a department of military engineers and surveyors to build and improve harbours, forts and other fortifications. In 1716 a Corps of Engineers was founded by the Board of Ordnance, again at their Woolwich base. Initially an officer-only corps, the Engineers (called Royal Engineers from 1787) were engaged in the design, construction and ongoing maintenance of defences, fortifications and other military installations. They were also engaged for large-scale civilian projects from time to time. A civilian corps of 'artificers' provided the non-commissioned workforce of carpenters, stonemasons, bricklayers and other labourers; this corps was militarized in 1787, and named the Royal Military Artificers (they were then renamed the Royal Sappers and Miners 25 years later). The year after the demise of the Ordnance Board, the Sappers and Miners were fully amalgamated into the Royal Engineers, and at the same time the Corps moved from Woolwich to its present headquarters in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham,_Kent" title="Chatham, Kent">Chatham</a>. </p> 
           <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_corps">Other corps</span></h4> 
           <p>A <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Army_Ordnance_Corps#Before_Crimea" title="Royal Army Ordnance Corps">Field Train Department</a> was established in 1792 to serve as 'the field force element of the Board of Ordnance Storekeeping system';<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Sharpe1993_30-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sharpe1993-30">[30]</a></sup> staffed by uniformed civilians, the Department had oversight of the supply and provision of small arms, ammunition and other armaments to all front-line troops. After the Board's demise, the Ordnance Field Train was consolidated, together with the Ordnance Storekeepers and others, into a new Military Store Department, which eventually formed a key part of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Army_Ordnance_Corps" title="Royal Army Ordnance Corps">Royal Army Ordnance Corps</a>. </p>
           <p>In 1796 a Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers was raised (separate from the Royal Artillery itself) to provide horses and drivers for conveying guns from place to place.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Sharpe93_8-1"><a href="#cite_note-Sharpe93-8">[8]</a></sup> (Before this time civilian drivers were used and horses either requisitioned or hired on contract).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Roper1998_9-3"><a href="#cite_note-Roper1998-9">[9]</a></sup> In 1822 the Corps of Drivers was fully amalgamated into the Royal Artillery. </p>

           <p>The Board of Ordnance placed a high value on providing its future officers with a scientific and military education. In the eighteenth century there was no requirement for would-be Army officers to receive any formal military education; but the Board, in contrast, moved fast (after the establishment of its artillery and engineer corps) to provide for the education of its officer cadets. The Board was also ahead of the Army in its provision of advanced training for officers. </p> 
           <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Royal_Military_Academy">The Royal Military Academy</span></h4> 
           <p>In 1720 there were moves to set up an 'academy' within the Warren at Woolwich where the corps were based; and on 30 April 1741 the Academy was formally established there by Royal Warrant. The fact that the Warren itself was a place of scientific experiment and innovation no doubt helped form the style of education that emerged. Initially, it was a gathering of 'gentlemen cadets', brought together to learn 'gunnery, fortification, mathematics and a little French'. By 1764, the institution had been renamed the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Military_Academy,_Woolwich" title="Royal Military Academy, Woolwich">Royal Military Academy</a>, and in the words of the Survey of London, 'it became a uniquely enlightened establishment in which training comprehended writing, arithmetic, algebra, Latin, French, mathematics, fortification, together with the attack and defence of fortified places, gunnery, mining and laboratory-works [...] along with the gentlemanly skills of dancing and fencing’.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-SL48_33-0"><a href="#cite_note-SL48-33">[33]</a></sup> In time, the Academy outgrew its original home in the Arsenal, and in 1806 it moved into new headquarters on <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolwich_Common" title="Woolwich Common">Woolwich Common</a>.

            <p>from L&amp;M Companion<br>Established in its modern form under Henry VIII at about the same time as the Navy Board, it was responsible until 1855 for the manufacture and supply of munitions to both army and navy. It consisted of a Master (the equivalent of the Navy Tresurer) and a board of officers similar to the Principal Officers of the Navy and similarly charged with the duty of mutual supervision--the Lieutenant Surveyor, Clerk Storekeeper, Clerk of deliveries and (after 1670) Treasurer. In 1664-70 and 1679-82 their work was performed by commissioners. The offices and principal storehouses were in the Tower where many of the officers had official lodgings. By this time much of the 'materiel' was manufactured elsewhere than the Tower, in gunpowder facyories and gun foundaries. </p> 
            <p>In common with other departments in the late 17th century--such as the Treasury and Pepys's Navy Office and Admiralty--the Ordnance was to a significent extent, though not completely, reformed under the pressure of increased business. It gew in size--from 9 clerks in 1660 to 38 in 1703, and from 175 technical officers in 1675 to around 450 under Anne--and at the same time improved efficiency. Pepys greatly admired its methods. The Commissioners of 1664-70 began a process whereby contractors were paid 'in course', salaries were substituted for fees and life-tenures were abolished. From 1667 the office assumed responsibility for all fortifications in the kingdom. The Instuctions of 1683 issued by Lord Dartmouth, the Master, codified new and old practices.</p>

            <p>The production and storage of gunpowder was a dangerous matter, and lots of it was stored in the Tower of London, close to Pepys' office and home. This article has lots of interesting details:</p>
