Does this mean we'll be getting a Shakespeare sonnet every day for the foreseeable future?\nWe can only hope... "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=yaXmYTP4OU72MXhA8KR9R1oY1UA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=gvrvoAayaNjwvH6oqelqvJORA7o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=Ej72kg3B_240jI44XZjAgXlYsaY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=8QpvMZoEZ6a2criCIF1pT7YrtqM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Sir Patrick Stewart is reading soothing Shakespeare on Twitter while social distancing","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=Ej72kg3B_240jI44XZjAgXlYsaY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=Ej72kg3B_240jI44XZjAgXlYsaY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Sir Patrick Stewart is reading soothing Shakespeare on Twitter while social distancing","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Slay those sonnets, Captain.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Sir Patrick Stewart is reading soothing Shakespeare on Twitter while social distancing"}]

In recent weeks, we've seen a whole host of Instagram messages and videos from actors, some of which have been better received than others.\nIt's probably fair to say that Gal Gadot's star-packed rendition of \"Imagine\" wasn't exactly the most popular effort — but it certainly seems to be inspiring others.\n24-year-old LA-based film-maker Austin Harris was one of the many people who saw the viral video ‚ and it ended up prompting him to make his own version.\nThe twist? Instead of \"Imagine,\" he and his friends performed (of all things) Toni Collette's brutal monologue from the horror movie Hereditary.\n\"I honestly felt bad about how much they were being roasted because it seemed so earnest,\" Harris told Mashable. \"So I wanted to do an ironic version of that with something that on the surface is absolutely not uplifting.\"\nBehold:\nI was so inspired by those celebrities singing “Imagine” that I asked some friends to come together to perform Toni Collette’s “I am your mother” monologue from Hereditary pic.twitter.com/BrR5ejSBV4— Austin S. Harris (@austinsharris) March 25, 2020\n\nHarris explained that he chose Hereditary because it's one of his all-time favourite movies.\n\"What I love most about the movie is that while it’s really scary, it also has a lot of darkly comedic moments, and this monologue really encapsulates that,\" he said. \"Toni Collette is especially incredible in this scene — the range of emotion is insane. There’s some funny lines, some crying, some screaming — it’s really difficult, frankly. So I figured it’d be fun to make my friends try and do that.\"\nSEE ALSO: 7 ways to help quell coronavirus-related anxiety\nLuckily, many of Harris' friends are actors — and judging by the range of performances in the video (including the glorious \"ya sista dead\" moment from Jaz Garner and the frankly Oscar-worthy crying from Mikey Levitt), they were more than up to the task. Harris explained that he put the monologue into a Google doc and asked everyone to highlight the parts they wanted to read, so he could then stitch the results together.\nIn order of appearance: Kristen Van Nest, @harrishunt, @tondonguyen (countdown snuggie kid yeah), @Thecinemadoll, Max Banta, @kim_hoyos, me, @MikeyLevitt (tears boy)...— Austin S. Harris (@austinsharris) March 25, 2020\n\n... Isaiah Hoban Halvorsen, @jazdidwhat (but ya sista dead), Aleah Quiñones, Rachel Hilson (fresh off This Is Us), @mrshk_dzbl, @realjanamiley (buy toilet paper from her), @AaronDJacob, Analisa Gutierrez in an inspired outfit, and my darling @jahmiaable— Austin S. Harris (@austinsharris) March 25, 2020\n\n\"I really made this hoping that all of my friends, and some friends of friends, could see it and laugh,\" Harris said. \"Everyone in the video is either in college or fresh out, most of us in the entertainment field, so we’re always itching to make something, let alone when we’re trapped in our houses with nothing else to do.\" Obviously in the back of my mind I’m hoping it goes viral, but you can’t get your hopes up for that kind of thing. But when it started going viral — everyone was really excited. I’m especially happy for my actor friends who are getting some attention.\"\nHarris said that everyone was really excited when the video — which at the time of writing has almost 1.5 million views — started going viral.\n\"I initially made this to sort of make fun of the people who think a video is going to heal the nation, but seeing that it made people laugh in this scary, anxious time really made me happy,\" he said."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112577%252F94f04684-e80a-44e6-95fb-1be1ba3975e4.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=jdkhMn4bSZbk0MqVtHTJYZFFqZo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112577%252F94f04684-e80a-44e6-95fb-1be1ba3975e4.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=0sGKd38EOvKQupmg_uheXShJUTk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112577%252F94f04684-e80a-44e6-95fb-1be1ba3975e4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=g1aBcPfcuB2D8wBlQFlkSoPp3Jk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112577%252F94f04684-e80a-44e6-95fb-1be1ba3975e4.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=RFE068t5RprErF0hRt3-_S7dlYc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112577%252F94f04684-e80a-44e6-95fb-1be1ba3975e4.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=ZS2EH8vzUTgyayamkoZydvgGQog=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112577%252F94f04684-e80a-44e6-95fb-1be1ba3975e4.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=yRU9v8F8uLL6ydH2orsrsfdPJvk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"These friends parodied that celebrity 'Imagine' video with the speech from 'Hereditary'","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112577%252F94f04684-e80a-44e6-95fb-1be1ba3975e4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=g1aBcPfcuB2D8wBlQFlkSoPp3Jk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112577%252F94f04684-e80a-44e6-95fb-1be1ba3975e4.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=ZS2EH8vzUTgyayamkoZydvgGQog=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112577%252F94f04684-e80a-44e6-95fb-1be1ba3975e4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=g1aBcPfcuB2D8wBlQFlkSoPp3Jk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"These friends parodied that celebrity 'Imagine' video with the speech from 'Hereditary'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"Don't you ever raise your voice at me!\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"These friends parodied that celebrity 'Imagine' video with the speech from 'Hereditary'"},{"_id":"5e7c7e45ca2f0c5b94000004","id":"/video/jimmy-fallon-niall-horan-golf-video-chat/","title":"Jimmy Fallon and Niall Horan play golf over video chat","title_tag":null,"author":"Sam Haysom","post_date":"2020-03-26T10:04:52+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 10:04:52 +0000","formatted_date":"1 day ago","sort_key":"1JhyrU","link":"https://mashable.com/video/jimmy-fallon-niall-horan-golf-video-chat/","content":{"plain":"Jimmy Fallon's been using his working-from-home time pretty effectively.

It's all happening.\nThe former One Directioner appears via video chat as the latest guest on the home edition of The Tonight Show, promoting both his new album, Heartbreak Weather, and the charity he's supporting, Meals on Wheels.\nThe two chat about their new lives under social distancing, Horan hits some golf balls, and the whole thing ends with an acoustic performance of Horan's track, \"Dear Patience.\"\n\"I wrote it at a time when I needed to be patient,\" he says, \"and if anyone needs to be patient right now, it's all of us.\"Inside a Verily coronavirus testing site: How it

This includes one of the series' stars Courteney Cox, who joined Jimmy Kimmel via video call for a quick round of Friends trivia.\n\"I don't remember even being on the show,\" Cox confessed, shortly before being soundly thrashed by Kimmel's cousin from his home on Staten Island. \"I have such a bad memory.\"\nAs such, the actor has been spending her free socially distant time binge-watching Friends, which will probably come in handy once the reunion is back on. \"I just started season one — it's really good!\"\nCox and Kimmel also gave a shout out to Meals on Wheels, encouraging people to donate in these tough times. \"They're always there delivering meals to people who need meals, and now people really need meals because you can't leave the house,\" said Kimmel.Inside a Verily

bubbling across the planet with the spread of the coronavirus – and even Time Lords can feel it.\nJodie Whittaker, otherwise known as the 13th Doctor in the Doctor Who series, posted an \"emergency transmission\" as her onscreen counterpart in a moment of socially distanced solidarity with her human friends on Wednesday, via the BBC's official Twitter account.\n\"This is an emergency transmission,\" she says in the clip. \"If you're seeing this the TARDIS must have detected an upsurge in psychological signals from somewhere in space and time. Basically, I think somebody somewhere might be a little bit worried.\" \nShe's right.\nLike most folks in the UK, the Doctor is staying inside as per the rules of the government's lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the virus — but it's not the only reason she's looking out the window.\n\"I'm actually just self-isolating, or as I like to call it, hiding from an army on Sontarans. But keep that to yourself,\" she adds, before moving on to her pretty heartwarming five-step plan for dealing with any worrying situation.\nSEE ALSO: Dealing with coronavirus-related anxiety? Try stress baking.\n“One: Remember — you’ll get through this. And things will be all right, even if they look uncertain. Even if you’re worried, darkness never prevails,” she says.\n\"Two: Tell jokes, even bad ones. Especially bad ones. I’m brilliant at bad ones. Three: Be kind. Even kinder than you were yesterday, and I know you were super kind yesterday. Look out for each other. You won't be the only one worried. Talking will help, sharing will help.

Some have gone down well, others less so.\nThe latest effort comes from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is currently self-isolating after his wife, Sophie, tested positive for coronavirus. On Monday, Trudeau shared a video of himself talking about the measures people can take to ease the spread.\n\"Help spread the word with your own video,\" he wrote, \"and tag your friends to remind them to stay home too.\"\nYou need to stay home. And so do your friends and family members. Help spread the word with your own video - and tag your friends to remind them to stay home too. And together, we can #PlankTheCurve. @MichaelBuble and @VancityReynolds - can you help? #StayAtHomeSaveLives pic.twitter.com/f1PQQrzMIK— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 23, 2020\n\nThe video was posted shortly after Trudeau's latest press conference, in which he told Canadians to observe social distancing practices, hinting that greater measures could be taken if people don't \"go home and stay home.\"\nTrudeau used the hashtags #PlankTheCurve and #StayAtHomeSaveLives, tagging fellow Canadians Ryan Reynolds and Michael Buble to help him share the message.\nSEE ALSO: Still doubt coronavirus concerns? Watch this doctor's powerful speech.\nReynolds dropped his own effort 10 minutes later.\nAnother important message from an important celebrity. Let’s spread the word not the virus.

Right after healthcare workers, of course...first responders, people working essential services, er, ping pong players...mannequins...um, childhood imaginary friends...like, 400 other types of people...look, stay at home! Practice social distancing, wash your hands. \n\"We are gonna get through this thing.

Everyone. Doesn't matter who you are, where you're from.

Noah also talks about the charity he's currently raising money for, No Kid Hungry, which aims to feed the children who will have lost healthy meals due to recent school closures.\n\"For me, feeding kids is something you take for granted,\" says Noah. \"I know what it was like to grow up in a home where we didn't have food all the time.

the theatre at the moment due to coronavirus social distancing measures, but that doesn't mean you can't still watch famous actors reciting iambic pentameter.\nYou just need to head over to Sir Patrick Stewart's Twitter feed for that.\nOn Saturday, the legendary stage and screen actor — who was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company for over 15 years — shared a video of himself reciting an old classic: Shakespeare's Sonnet 116.\npic.twitter.com/dA92uM4Hr3— Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) March 21, 2020\n\nStewart didn't mention why he picked that particular sonnet, although the lyric about love being \"an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken\" seems pretty relevant at the moment.\nSEE ALSO: Still doubt coronavirus concerns? Watch this doctor's powerful speech.\nThe video got a solid 9,000+ retweets, and on Sunday night Stewart decided to post a follow-up.\n1. I was delighted by the response to yesterday's posting of Shakespeare's Sonnet 116, and it has led me to undertake what follows...— Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) March 22, 2020\n\n2. When I was a child in the 1940s, my mother would cut up slices of fruit for me (there wasn't much) and as she put it in front of me she would say, \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\" How about, “A sonnet a day keeps the doctor away”? So...here we go: Sonnet 1. pic.twitter.com/kDoMNhdqcI— Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) March 22, 2020\n\nYep, he's started at the beginning, with Sonnet 1. Does this mean we'll be getting a Shakespeare sonnet every day for the foreseeable future?\nWe can only hope... "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=yaXmYTP4OU72MXhA8KR9R1oY1UA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=gvrvoAayaNjwvH6oqelqvJORA7o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=zxUqIG--PHD4OhLxEW7gWupeuVg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112359%252Ff5f24d43-d4f6-42fc-95b7-b8c528cfb7c2.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=E4CnI3iQ9wtUi6O9XaIbErCD1FI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

Apparently, Rita Wilson's is taking a break from reading Ender's Game to spit every bar of a classic rap jam.\nRita Wilson and husband Tom Hanks have been quarantined in Australia since the couple reported on March 11 that they had tested positive for coronavirus. Both have been posting to social media semi-frequently, updating the world on their symptoms and incorrectly eating Australian food.\nThings took a turn for the weird — but impressive! — on Sunday. Wilson posted a video of herself wearing mascara and a floral headband while reading the dystopian 1985 sci-fi novel Ender's Game. She also happens to be listening to the 1992 rap song \"Hip Hop Hooray\" by Naughty by Nature. The gal's got taste!\nAfter a few moments, the song grabs Wilson's attention. \"Hey, hooo, hey, hooo\" she starts quietly singing to herself. Quietly that is, UNTIL she ferociously breaks out into the rap lyrics at the outset of the verse right along with the NBN crew. She ends up rapping the whole dang thing for over four minutes, and then goes back to reading her novel. RITA, what is going on???\n         View this post on Instagram           See it to believe it A post shared by  Rita Wilson (@ritawilson) on Mar 21, 2020 at 11:31pm PDT\nThe rap video was apparently the product of too much time in (semi) solitary. Wilson captioned the video \"Quarantine Stir Crazy.\" Same, Rita. Same.\nWilson got the stamp of approval from the song's original MCs. The official Naughty by Nature Instagram account posted the video with an approving caption and gave Wilson multiple shout outs in their story.\n         View this post on Instagram           Wow!!! Super shout to @ritawilson for spittin' those Classic Naughty bars during her Quarantine!! Wishing her and hubby @tomhanks a Speedy recovery!!! She has skills!! 💯💯💯💯 #KICKCORONASASS #naughtybynature #shaderoom #balleralert #tmz #worldstarhiphop #breakfastclub #hot97whosnext #mediatakeout A post shared by  Official Naughty By Nature (@naughtybynature4ever) on Mar 22, 2020 at 9:26am PDT\nTons of celebs also lauded Wilson's skillz in the comments. Kim Kardashian posted the comment \"The best video EVER!!!!!!\" Real Housewife Kyle Richards implores Rita to \"Get better soon!! Come home!\" And in the comments of the video on Naughty by Nature's page, fellow 90s rappers Cypress Hill simply comments: \"👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼.\" \nTo which we can only give a hard agree. Get well soon, Rita!\nUPDATE: March 22, 2020, 5:11 p.m. EDT A previous version of this article misidentified Kyle Richards as Kyle Richardson. That has been updated."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1251529%252F7d69c2fd-a724-40d9-bbfa-e86c39e23cb0.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=_Ma1uM7UkwIUdiBL-J9Fd7wuFjI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=1BZRZn7ugHYj4HKhyw7TRwVXnf4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=I6HRw7I-UPeRP5xzaIwTaVyxxSw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=K9mkA8X4AzSIkQ1IEwKqI98mTQU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=YMARkLiPD7OTABjuBm7ZAv0wNFk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=j9U_cWH8bpSDy7dKILKCLYAr1RU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Rita Wilson rapping 90s hip hop is our quarantine queen","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=I6HRw7I-UPeRP5xzaIwTaVyxxSw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=UptI6jcjZWB6BEr9J7YLxNnmdbI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=OwxKmLjXJlqHApQZ43GXruJ_Agw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=YMARkLiPD7OTABjuBm7ZAv0wNFk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=I6HRw7I-UPeRP5xzaIwTaVyxxSw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Rita Wilson rapping 90s hip hop is our quarantine queen","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Coronavirus got her \"stir crazy.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Rita Wilson rapping 90s hip hop is our quarantine queen"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":32}

before being soundly thrashed by Kimmel's cousin from his home on Staten Island. \"I have such a bad memory.\"\nAs such, the actor has been spending her free socially distant time binge-watching

countries enter lockdown and social distancing conditions to help ease the spread of coronavirus, more and more celebrities have been weighing in on social media.\nSome of their messages have been quirky and informative, while others have been amusing. Some have gone down well, others less so.\nThe latest effort comes from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is currently self-isolating after his wife, Sophie, tested positive for coronavirus. On Monday, Trudeau shared a video of himself talking about the measures people can take to ease the spread.\n\"Help spread the word with your own video,\" he wrote, \"and tag your friends to remind them to stay home too.\"\nYou need to stay home. And so do your friends and family members. Help spread the word with your own video - and tag your friends to remind them to stay home too. And together, we can #PlankTheCurve. @MichaelBuble and @VancityReynolds - can you help? #StayAtHomeSaveLives pic.twitter.com/f1PQQrzMIK— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 23, 2020\n\nThe video was posted shortly after Trudeau's latest press conference, in which he told Canadians to observe social distancing practices, hinting that greater measures could be taken if people don't \"go home and stay home.\"\nTrudeau used the hashtags #PlankTheCurve and #StayAtHomeSaveLives, tagging fellow Canadians Ryan Reynolds and Michael Buble to help him share the message.\nSEE ALSO: Still doubt coronavirus concerns? Watch this doctor's powerful speech.\nReynolds dropped his own effort 10 minutes later.\nAnother important message from an important celebrity. Let’s spread the word not the virus.

Right after healthcare workers, of course...first responders, people working essential services, er, ping pong players...mannequins...um, childhood imaginary friends...like, 400 other types of people...look, stay at home! Practice social distancing, wash your hands. \n\"We are gonna get through this thing. We're gonna get through this thing together.\"\nReynolds went on to tag some more celebrities, including an impressively hairy Seth Rogen, who tagged the likes of Shawn Mendes and Lilly Singh, also fellow Canadians.\nHelp #PlanktheCurve. Please let’s not get sick.  @Lilly @BaruchelNDG @ShawnMendes pic.twitter.com/KcRfqHshmL— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 24, 2020\n\nLooks like there are going to be more videos where those came from, whether it sticks to Canadian celebrities or not.\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, has now infected around 335,000 people worldwide.

Noah also talks about the charity he's currently raising money for, No Kid Hungry, which aims to feed the children who will have lost healthy meals due to recent school closures.\n\"For me, feeding kids is something you take for granted,\" says Noah. \"I know what it was like to grow up in a home where we didn't have food all the time.

television history.\nTo celebrate The Office's milestone anniversary, former co-stars Jenna Fischer (Pam Beesly) and Angela Kinsey (Angela Martin) spoke with Mashable about the show's enduring legacy, a potential reboot, and their new podcast, Office Ladies.\nThe two also reflected on some of the show's most memorable moments, and shared their favorite cold opens of the series.\nSEE ALSO: John Krasinski couldn't stop laughing when filming this episode of 'The Office' with Steve Carell\n\"I know my favorite cold open,\" Kinsey said during a phone interview without taking a beat to think. \"I will never ever forget watching the fire drill cold open in the 'Stress Relief' episode [Season 5, Episode 14]. Dwight has locked us all in the office to teach us how to survive a fire, and it's just absolute mayhem from start to finish. Everything about that opening we rehearsed with our camera operators and our crew, and it was like learning a really intricate dance. On 'action' every single little thing had to happen. It was like a domino effect.\"\n\"Save Bandit!\" she exclaimed with a laugh. \"How many times do you go to work and throw an enormous cat through the ceiling?\"\nKinsey went on to explain that the cold open also featured an accidentally brilliant blooper. \"We ran into Randall [Einhorn, one of the show's camera operators] on accident and he fell over with the camera, did sort of a somersault, and just kept going. We left it in. That was not planned.\"\nTo this day I can't watch the \"Stress Relief\" cold open without experiencing the kind of laughter that makes my body bounce up and down and tears leak from the corners of my eyes. So in honor of the show's 15th anniversary, let us all rewatch the mayhem unfold.\n\n\"[Stress Relief] was gonna be mine!\" Fischer said before thoughtfully throwing out two other noteworthy favorites. \"Hands down for me is the fire drill, but so that we're not the same, two things sprung to mind. One's when we did the lip dub, which was kind of similar because it was so fun whenever we got to break out and do something that required choreography, timing, and rehearsal.\"\n\"But having just rewatched the show I have this huge appreciation for the fitness orb cold open [Season 2, Episode 8]. I think one of the things I love about it is how we captured what was basically a blooper — with the fitness orb popping — and we kept it in,\" Fischer, who's partial to any cold open that includes a Jim prank, said.\n\"I'll never forget all of our shock and surprise when it happened and what it was like on set when the ball popped and Rainn went flying. We disintegrated into laughter.\" \nFans can watch The Office now on Netflix.

Apparently, Rita Wilson's is taking a break from reading Ender's Game to spit every bar of a classic rap jam.\nRita Wilson and husband Tom Hanks have been quarantined in Australia since the couple reported on March 11 that they had tested positive for coronavirus. Both have been posting to social media semi-frequently, updating the world on their symptoms and incorrectly eating Australian food.\nThings took a turn for the weird — but impressive! — on Sunday. Wilson posted a video of herself wearing mascara and a floral headband while reading the dystopian 1985 sci-fi novel Ender's Game. She also happens to be listening to the 1992 rap song \"Hip Hop Hooray\" by Naughty by Nature. The gal's got taste!\nAfter a few moments, the song grabs Wilson's attention. \"Hey, hooo, hey, hooo\" she starts quietly singing to herself. Quietly that is, UNTIL she ferociously breaks out into the rap lyrics at the outset of the verse right along with the NBN crew. She ends up rapping the whole dang thing for over four minutes, and then goes back to reading her novel. RITA, what is going on???\n         View this post on Instagram           See it to believe it A post shared by  Rita Wilson (@ritawilson) on Mar 21, 2020 at 11:31pm PDT\nThe rap video was apparently the product of too much time in (semi) solitary. Wilson captioned the video \"Quarantine Stir Crazy.\" Same, Rita. Same.\nWilson got the stamp of approval from the song's original MCs. The official Naughty by Nature Instagram account posted the video with an approving caption and gave Wilson multiple shout outs in their story.\n         View this post on Instagram           Wow!!! Super shout to @ritawilson for spittin' those Classic Naughty bars during her Quarantine!! Wishing her and hubby @tomhanks a Speedy recovery!!! She has skills!! 💯💯💯💯 #KICKCORONASASS #naughtybynature #shaderoom #balleralert #tmz #worldstarhiphop #breakfastclub #hot97whosnext #mediatakeout A post shared by  Official Naughty By Nature (@naughtybynature4ever) on Mar 22, 2020 at 9:26am PDT\nTons of celebs also lauded Wilson's skillz in the comments. Kim Kardashian posted the comment \"The best video EVER!!!!!!\" Real Housewife Kyle Richards implores Rita to \"Get better soon!! Come home!\" And in the comments of the video on Naughty by Nature's page, fellow 90s rappers Cypress Hill simply comments: \"👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼.\" \nTo which we can only give a hard agree. Get well soon, Rita!\nUPDATE: March 22, 2020, 5:11 p.m. EDT A previous version of this article misidentified Kyle Richards as Kyle Richardson. That has been updated."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1251529%252F7d69c2fd-a724-40d9-bbfa-e86c39e23cb0.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=_Ma1uM7UkwIUdiBL-J9Fd7wuFjI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=1BZRZn7ugHYj4HKhyw7TRwVXnf4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=I6HRw7I-UPeRP5xzaIwTaVyxxSw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=K9mkA8X4AzSIkQ1IEwKqI98mTQU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=YMARkLiPD7OTABjuBm7ZAv0wNFk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=j9U_cWH8bpSDy7dKILKCLYAr1RU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Rita Wilson rapping 90s hip hop is our quarantine queen","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=I6HRw7I-UPeRP5xzaIwTaVyxxSw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=UptI6jcjZWB6BEr9J7YLxNnmdbI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=OwxKmLjXJlqHApQZ43GXruJ_Agw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=YMARkLiPD7OTABjuBm7ZAv0wNFk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112355%252Fbac69fcf-970a-4467-b7b2-a382f6f8498f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=I6HRw7I-UPeRP5xzaIwTaVyxxSw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Rita Wilson rapping 90s hip hop is our quarantine queen","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Coronavirus got her \"stir crazy.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Rita Wilson rapping 90s hip hop is our quarantine queen"}]
