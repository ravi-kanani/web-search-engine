But today's wide-scale shutdown of cities, extreme social distancing measures, and plummeting transportation usage will have no immediate, meaningful impact on Earth's colossal carbon dioxide woes or the planet's relentless warming trend.\nThe rising atmospheric concentrations of the potent heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide — now at its highest levels in at least 800,000 years, but more likely millions of years — hasn't slowed much, if at all. And an event that will cost countless lives wasn't ever a climate fix, anyhow.\n\"This is not anyone’s idea of a solution to the climate crisis,\" said Kristopher Karnauskas, a climate scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder.\nSlowing down the rise in CO2 will mean big, long-term societal changes. If widespread economic shutdowns persist through the coming months, we'll likely see a slowing down of rising CO2 numbers in the atmosphere. But, critically, this won't make a dent in the mass, or pile, of carbon dioxide we've built up over the last 150 years. \n\"The pile is still there,\" said Ralph Keeling, the director of the Scripps CO2 Program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \"We're not getting rid of the pile.\"\nTo better understand, let's look at the big picture, and then zoom in.\nThe big, big picture\nThe graph below shows how Earth's carbon dioxide emissions have skyrocketed in the last century or so. Compared to the last 800,000 years, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are rising sharply.\n\nThe last 60 years\nHere, we can see that atmospheric CO2 numbers have kept rising, unabated, since the 1960s. (The red, saw-like line shows how each year atmospheric CO2 levels also naturally rise and fall when the great forests of the Northern Hemisphere gulp up CO2 during the warm seasons, and then release it back into the atmosphere in the fall.) \n\nThe last year\nBelow is a zoomed-in look at CO2 numbers over the last year. We can see one of the seasonal drops, or valleys, amid the incessantly rising CO2 numbers. There might be a slight slowdown in February and March — maybe partly attributable to China's colossal coronavirus shutdown — but nothing extreme or beyond what could have happened naturally. \n\"There's not much suggestion yet of a clear turndown in the growth rate,\" said Keeling.\nBut, if global economies continue to slow during these periods of extreme social isolation and business closures, a slowing trend could become more apparent in the coming months, Keeling said. \n\nYet, the big picture is clear: Earth has a massive stockpile of accumulated CO2. The pandemic might temporarily slow the relentless growth of these emissions, but it will hardly make a dent in the overall problem (see above: \"The big, big picture.\") The pandemic alone won’t impact the long-term, amassing CO2 trend we’ve seen over the last century.\nWhat's more, countries will seek to stimulate their stagnant economies, like the $2 trillion dollar spending bill in Congress — which would be the biggest single stimulus in the nation's history. These robust stimulus efforts will boost carbon emissions, as the industrialized world largely runs on fossil fuels.\n\"There’s going to be some kind of rebound,\" said Karnauskas. \"They’re going to work double-time to make up for it.\"\nIf CO₂ emissions drop an extreme 10% in 2020, would we see it in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations?Unlikely. ~45% of CO₂ emissions remain in the atmosphere: ~42*0.45=19GtCO₂/yr.A 10% drop would mean ~17GtCO₂/yr. Well within natural variability!https://t.co/2MNQn6JRCI pic.twitter.com/19HF4re9qE— Glen Peters (@Peters_Glen) March 23, 2020\n\nLooking more like a one-time drop in year-to-date CO2 change, and if it had anything to do with #COVIDー19, perhaps due to China's measures? https://t.co/SXkCWFV231 pic.twitter.com/TqYq2S1Jif— Kris Karnauskas (@OceansClimateCU) March 22, 2020\n\nThere is, however, the possibility that this historic pandemic will drive longer-term societal changes that permanently slow the rise in atmospheric carbon concentrations. \n\"When we come out of this, how does it change our behavior?\" asked Keeling. \"The world won’t be the same when we come out of this.\"\nAfter months of not flying, commuting less, and working from home, perhaps there will be permanent shifts in how we choose to live. This could mean using less energy, emitting less carbon, and eventually lowering the CO2 in our atmosphere.\nSEE ALSO: You can't kill the coronavirus. That's OK.\nBut, these CO2 concentrations will still keep going up until we drop carbon emissions to zero, emphasized Karnauskas. We're far, far, far away from achieving that. In 2019, for example, carbon emissions rose to their highest levels ever. Humanity dumped some 38.6 billion tons of CO2 into the air last year. Reducing that to zero will take herculean changes.\nOnce society curbs this pandemic — if we commit to following critical social distancing measures — it will be easy to see if we ultimately cut emissions. Atmospheric carbon concentrations don't lie. They've been going up for well over a century. \n\"You can’t hide the emissions,\" said Karnauskas."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=hNBX5zlLd-sViOTsmplWYMkGhDo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=f5eHcPkgoI62bJmYb21Z4lvYkaM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F800x360.png?signature=hiBmhIlSSAkdcb5IiLEsJWhKJWw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F1600x720.png?signature=ZQr4yz2cuWo6XNrNAQkOBcsIneU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Coronavirus won’t make a dent in the climate problem","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F800x360.png?signature=hiBmhIlSSAkdcb5IiLEsJWhKJWw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"800","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F800x360.png?signature=hiBmhIlSSAkdcb5IiLEsJWhKJWw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","sizes":"800w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Coronavirus won’t make a dent in the climate problem","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"We're not getting rid of the pile.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Science","channel_label":"Science","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Science/","tweet_text":"Coronavirus won’t make a dent in the climate problem"}

Although Arctic sea ice this season reached its biggest extent since 2013, it's still significantly lower than it was four decades ago. The Arctic is the fastest-warming region on Earth, and though there will always be fluctuating winters, sea ice is in a deep decline. \n\"While this year's maximum sea ice extent was a bump up from the last few years, it is still well below average and far from conditions in the 1980s and 1990s,\" said Zack Labe, a climate scientist and Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Irvine. \n\"The bottom line is that the Arctic is still trending over the long term toward less extensive ice cover throughout the year, but with year to year variations,\" agreed Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. \nSimilarly, the official announcement has been made by the @NSIDC (https://t.co/k9tBTaVJmL) ---> \"The 2020 maximum sea ice extent is the eleventh lowest in the 42-year satellite record.\" Small differences in ranking are expected between sea ice data sets. pic.twitter.com/RZOwdZmjdX— Zack Labe (@ZLabe) March 24, 2020\n\nOfficially, after a pretty cold Arctic winter, the maximum, or largest, amount of sea ice was the eleventh lowest in 42 years of satellite record-keeping, which was the highest in eight years. \"It doesn’t in any way indicate a rebound, but rather year-to-year variations, which we expect to see,\" said Meier.\nThe colder winter was largely caused by a well-known fluctuating weather pattern, called the Arctic Oscillation. This year, zones of high pressure below the Arctic kept the cooler Arctic air, and the infamous polar vortex, locked in place. That meant an increase in sea ice. But nothing extreme. \nIt's dark in the high north over winter, but overall, the Arctic suffers from a vicious sun-related cycle that decimates its ice. It's called the albedo effect, wherein bright white sea ice melts (often due to warmer air temperatures). This leaves large swathes of dark ocean exposed to absorb more heat from the sun, which warms the ocean and in turn melts more ice. It's a relentless feedback loop of melting. \nBy the end of summer, this leaves sea ice profoundly melted before each winter begins.\n\"The 13 lowest [sea ice] extents in the satellite era have all occurred in the last 13 years,\" the National Snow and Ice Data Center said last year. \nAnd just like that, Bering Sea #seaice extent has declined more than 35% from its March 12 maximum; March 25 extent is the 4th lowest in the 42 year @NSIDC satellite era. Big losses Gulf of Anadyr and southeast Bering. #akwx #Arctic @Climatologist49 @seaice_de @KNOMnews @ZLabe pic.twitter.com/MFIp86hmWA— Rick Thoman (@AlaskaWx) March 26, 2020\n\nDramatic decline of sea ice cover in the Bering Sea (near Alaska) during the last week. This is a result of a change in weather conditions (e.g., southerly winds; https://t.co/HdIFf8Vm7V). Data from @NSIDC. pic.twitter.com/nOXWBZesGC— Zack Labe (@ZLabe) March 25, 2020\n\nOn top of the Arctic's relentless warming trend, fluctuating weather will always play a role in shaping the extent and volume of sea ice. Sometimes this will lead to bumps in sea ice, and sometimes dips. \n\"Changes in daily weather conditions play a major role in the evolution of Arctic sea ice,\" said Labe.\nSEE ALSO: Coronavirus won’t make a dent in the climate problem\nFor example, storms and winds have decimated sea ice in the Bering Sea over the last week. This rapidly dropped Arctic sea ice to its fourth-lowest levels, for this time of year, on record. \nBut the big picture remains clear. The climate situation remains unchanged. Earth is relentlessly warming — 19 of the last 20 years are the warmest on record — and the Arctic is dramatically changing.\n\"The basic story is the same, but this year represents a bit of an upward 'bump' on the overall downward trend,\" said Meier."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1256877%252F4cf2ab5e-95ef-4fdc-903b-72e4a506d09d.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=L9Glu5gGT3-Cp7F_UhEu8_sXOZk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=RbeE1oJ2XaXKSgzgpOAAa9yxOtg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F280x158.png?signature=mjFWSK5C11LIa8IgbnLSdUfuqFI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F560x316.png?signature=r3YAB4O7wNt_fH9O9bHaJLvQbao=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Even after a frigid winter, Arctic sea ice is still really low","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F280x158.png?signature=mjFWSK5C11LIa8IgbnLSdUfuqFI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=P9ZTTj7lR5uvQLUKSx8PALVjY6Y=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F280x158.png?signature=mjFWSK5C11LIa8IgbnLSdUfuqFI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Even after a frigid winter, Arctic sea ice is still really low","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"It is still well below average.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Science","channel_label":"Science","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Science/","tweet_text":"Even after a frigid winter, Arctic sea ice is still really low"},{"_id":"5e6bb1d2f11b2c54a4000054","id":"/article/antarctica-greenland-melting-gigatonne-ice/","title":"NASA sticks a colossal ice block in NYC in new video","title_tag":null,"author":"Mark Kaufman","post_date":"2020-03-13T16:16:17+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 16:16:17 +0000","formatted_date":"03/13/2020","sort_key":"1JcShE","link":"https://mashable.com/article/antarctica-greenland-melting-gigatonne-ice/","content":{"plain":"The greatest masses of ice on Earth, in Antarctica and Greenland, aren't just melting — this melt is accelerating. \nHow much ice are these critical polar regions losing into the oceans? NASA uses satellites to diligently measure the conditions of these colossal ice sheets. Between 2002 to 2017, the GRACE satellite observed 5,641 gigatonnes of ice loss. (For reference, a single gigatonne is equivalent to 1 billion metric tons — and there are about 2,200 pounds in a single metric ton.)\n\"This is enough to cover Texas in a sheet of ice 26 feet high,\" said NASA. \nTo help visualize a single gigatonne, NASA made a new video, shown below in its shorter form (via Instagram) and longer form, which is only 24 seconds and definitely worth your time. As NASA notes, a gigatonne of ice in 843-acre Central Park would reach 1,119 feet high.\nThat's taller than Manhattan's iconic Chrysler Building, once the tallest building in the world.\n         View this post on Instagram           Satellite data show that Antarctica and Greenland are losing hundreds of gigatonnes of (land-based) ice each year. But how big is just one gigatonne? • Visit the link in our bio for answers (and cool visualizations). • 📽: One gigatonne of ice in the context of New York City's Central Park.

And Greenland's rate of melt has accelerated by seven times since the 1990s.\nBoth of these historically unprecedented events are ultimately driven by a relentlessly heating planet, as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations continue to skyrocket. \nIn Greenland — home to an ice sheet two and a half times the size of Texas — a warming atmosphere is driving much of this melt. Meanwhile, in Antarctica, warmer ocean waters are eating away at the ends of glaciers that float over the ocean, known as ice shelves. This poses a giant problem. \nThe mighty Thwaites glacier, one of the largest glaciers on Earth, lies in Antarctica. Warmer ocean waters are melting away the ice shelf at a \"tremendous rate,\" and in the coming decades the glacier may pass the point of no return — meaning unstoppable amounts of Thwaites' ice on the Antarctic continent will pour into the sea.\n\"Thwaites is the one spot in Antarctica that has the potential to dump an enormous amount of water into the ocean over the next decades,\" Sridhar Anandakrishnan, a professor of glaciology at Penn State University, told Mashable. \nSEE ALSO: What, exactly, does Congress understand about the world's most threatening glacier?\nThwaites alone could trigger over two feet of sea level rise this century. \nAlready, though, many gigatons of ice are pouring in the sea. Under extremely optimistic (if not nearly impossible) scenarios wherein global society curbs Earth's warming at an ambitious 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-Industrial Revolution temperatures, the relatively conservative UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects around two feet of sea level rise this century.\nBut it could be more, much more. This depends on how much society curbs its carbon emissions in the coming decade and beyond, and potentially stabilizes the warming climate."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1244199%252Fc16063fe-b340-4178-aaec-a43e6fcdf694.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=0dWJayduj3PNsAqI7SOsm9uRzNU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=rEhkkVIPhp5RQ2Sz-4UbtEo2vXk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F280x158.png?signature=2ALRpWajFkaKA28qRYqqA6HK6ZU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F560x316.png?signature=3WAnUnIpJkXHoYSpcrEFS0flMKI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"NASA sticks a colossal ice block in NYC in new video","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F280x158.png?signature=2ALRpWajFkaKA28qRYqqA6HK6ZU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=px8zRPQCCAKDkl6X1v5bpAuD4HM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F280x158.png?signature=2ALRpWajFkaKA28qRYqqA6HK6ZU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"NASA sticks a colossal ice block in NYC in new video","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG2WMQ0N","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"What does a gigatonne of ice look like?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Science","channel_label":"Science","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Science/","tweet_text":"NASA sticks a colossal ice block in NYC in new video"}]

This #storm will bring 1-3\" of #rain, a few #thunderstorms with #hail, and gusty #winds to #SoCal and the #Southwest. pic.twitter.com/B1v49HbgaY— NOAA Satellites - Public Affairs (@NOAASatellitePA) March 9, 2020\n\nAnd this cyclone brought along a big friend. Below, or to the south of the cyclone, is a long line of clouds, known as an atmospheric river. These are formidable bands of moisture that often deluge California with potent rain and snow, sometimes to damaging degrees. Spinning mid-latitude cyclones often drive these long bands of moisture, as they pull the atmospheric river behind the storm, explained Weber.\nIn this case, the bulk of the atmospheric river, also dubbed a \"river in the sky,\" has slammed into Baja California, Mexico's long, wild peninsula.\nSEE ALSO: What, exactly, does Congress understand about the world's most threatening glacier?\nEven so, areas around Southern California that have had \"very much below average\" rainfall will still get some much needed precipitation.\nOverall, California just had its driest February on record, with the northern parts of the state particularly dry. But this mid-latitude cyclone won't help Northern California out, this time, anyway.\nThe Lower 48 states just had their sixth warmest winter on record, with pretty much all of California experiencing above-average temperatures. These temperatures, combined with unusually low rainfall, foreshadow another ominous wildfire season. \n\n "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1240355%252Fc9605955-2a35-4b6c-9c68-b89ad07d1acc.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=t-HsXYLOzJ8iJ--U4qmexOCfD2w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111809%252Fa47fa9be-6b48-46ea-976e-8b75d29c5920.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=SdFXsbv8M7h-NfSfhhlYXihijms=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111809%252Fa47fa9be-6b48-46ea-976e-8b75d29c5920.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ngSvGUdKMxgOylJYAi6Z75yd7Ys=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111809%252Fa47fa9be-6b48-46ea-976e-8b75d29c5920.png%252F712x410.png?signature=Ct0VP10gOZvR_PEUEmitu9PfyDw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111809%252Fa47fa9be-6b48-46ea-976e-8b75d29c5920.png%252F280x157.png?signature=Ow4x42bq_1hwrTmJVtU4FE6qV58=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111809%252Fa47fa9be-6b48-46ea-976e-8b75d29c5920.png%252F560x314.png?signature=zvXyFRy-lDvyU5JSDZWe1LXEdow=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"A mid-latitude cyclone on March 10, 2020.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-california-rain-cyclone.png","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-california-rain-cyclone.png","micro":1},"src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1240355%252Fc9605955-2a35-4b6c-9c68-b89ad07d1acc.png%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=-fqz4NoVC9XxH_u2lWbgVqMCB90=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1240355%252Fc9605955-2a35-4b6c-9c68-b89ad07d1acc.png%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=08Y9l1nxzLSWOU_ydwP5X3BXqz0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"A mid-latitude cyclone on March 10, 2020."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  noaa / colorado state university / goes 17"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"This cyclone is soaking Southern California with welcome rain","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"It's a good ole mid-latitude cyclone.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Science","channel_label":"Science","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Science/","tweet_text":"This cyclone is soaking Southern California with welcome rain"},{"_id":"5e62c740f11b2c09b400002d","id":"/article/shell-international-womens-day/","title":"Shell will change its name to She'll for International Women's Day, effectively solving sexism","title_tag":null,"author":"Morgan Sung","post_date":"2020-03-06T21:57:19+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 06 Mar 2020 21:57:19 +0000","formatted_date":"03/06/2020","sort_key":"1Jawjg","link":"https://mashable.com/article/shell-international-womens-day/","content":{"plain":"In a stunning display of performative feminism, Shell is changing its name to She'll for International Women's Day. \nWell, one Shell.

Yes, it will still get you drunk.","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Thompson","post_date":"2020-02-28T16:44:58+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 16:44:58 +0000","formatted_date":"02/28/2020","sort_key":"1J80Qw","link":"https://mashable.com/article/gin-garden-peas/","content":{"plain":"Garden peas are probably the last thing you'd ever expect to go into your gin and tonic. \nBut, scientists at Abertay University and the James Hutton Institute in Scotland have created a gin using garden peas. Yes, you read that correctly. The gin is called Nàdar — which means 'nature' in Gaelic — and scientists claim it has a smaller environmental footprint that traditionally distilled gins made using wheat. \nEach 700ml bottle of Nàdar has a carbon footprint of -1.54 kg CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent), \"meaning it avoids more carbon dioxide emissions than it creates,\" according to an Abertay University statement. \nWhile it's well-known that gin is made from juniper berries, it actually requires a base spirit — most often made from wheat — which the botanicals are then added to. \"Traditional beverages like beer and whiskey are produced from cereals which do require quite a lot of artificial fertiliser,\" said Graeme Walker, professor of zymology at Abertay University, who supervised the pea gin project. \"This has an impact on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.\"\n\nTo compare, a 1 litre bottle of Tanqueray gin has a carbon footprint of 1.8kg CO2. That said, it's also pretty tricky to calculate because a Tanqueray G&T sipped in the U.S. has a significantly higher footprint compared to one imbibed in London. The pea gin's environmental performance is down to the fact that all useful parts of the peas — from the dehulling down to the distilling — are used to create home-grown animal feed. \nIt took five years of research in collaboration with Arbikie Distillery — a working farm on the east coast of Angus, Scotland — to develop the gin. So, why peas, you may well be wondering? PhD student Kirsty Black — the lead researcher on the project — told Mashable that peas, and legumes in general, are a \"great choice of crop for environmental and biodiversity reasons.\" Arbikie Distillery doesn't ship in any products to make its gin because it's a working farm — they grow all the wheat, barley, potatoes etc. on site. \n\"Most of the crops that we grow nowadays require the use of fertiliser to provide the nitrogen they need to produce the desired quality and quantity of harvest,\" Black explained. \"Unfortunately, fertiliser use is now known to have a negative environmental impact.\"\n\nPlants need nitrogen (N) for their growth and reproduction. \"Despite nearly 80 percent of our atmosphere being N, it is in its non reactive form so unusable by plants,\" said Black. This is where legumes like peas, beans, and lentils come in. \nPeas have a natural ability to source the nitrogen they need for growth using a process called 'biological nitrogen fixation' — which means you don't need to use environmentally damaging synthetic fertilisers. Legumes differ from most plants because they're able to fix nitrogen from the air with a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in root nodules — converting non-reactive nitrogen into reactive nitrogen. \"This allows legumes to be self sufficient, not requiring any nitrogen fertiliser, but they also share this nitrogen with surrounding plants and leave residues in the soil reducing the need for fertiliser use on subsequent crops.\"\nSEE ALSO: This beer is made from surplus 'wonky' crumpets\nThe distilling process also creates a waste product called 'pot ale' — made from the leftover pea protein and spent yeast, which can be used as a highly nutritious animal feed. The first patch of Arbikie pea gin pot ale is currently being fed to cows on a farm neighbouring the distillery in Montrose, in Angus, Scotland. \nSo, does it taste like peas? Mashable actually managed to sample the pea gin and can confirm there isn't a pea taste to it. We added tonic water and a slice of lemon to the mix and sampled it in a gin and tonic. Our final verdict: very enjoyable; tastes like gin; has a slight aftertaste that we couldn't quite put our finger on. \n\n\"Using peas doesn’t impact the final taste of the gin,\" said Black. \"To make any gin the most common method is to distill your botanicals with a neutral base spirit. Here we’ve made this base spirit out of peas but the flavours in the gin are from the botanicals we’ve chosen to use.\"\nThe gin recipe they've opted to use comprises typical gin botanicals including juniper, coriander, lemon grass, and lime leaves. \"Gin is basically a neutral spirit flavoured with botanicals including juniper — it is the juniper that makes gin gin!\" she added. For those worried that the pea gin is less junipery, Black confirmed that it had the same amount of juniper as normal gins. \n\nSo, what needs to change in the gin industry in order to move towards more sustainable distilling practices? \n\"We just need to ensure we consider sustainability and environmental impact when making any decision within a business, whether that’s relating to what your base spirit is made from, what botanicals you use or how it is packaged — they can all make a difference,\" said Black.\nSo, how do you ensure botanicals are sourced sustainably? \"For all botanicals the important thing is to obtain them in a sustainable manner whether you are growing them yourself, harvesting from the wild or by purchasing from a reputable supplier. You obviously don’t want to impact the wild population of plants negatively,\" Black added. \nCheers to getting drunk sustainably. \nYou can buy Arbikie's Nàdar Gin online for £43.00 per 700ml bottle. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1224302%252F900d089d-4fc0-4a12-b9f3-52b46a88fc1b.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=p3fPaoPpsY6ULaDOBNuHQ3WwW7M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111300%252Fa1436829-b98c-4d38-ae79-959b343ca60d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=jnUrFIqXPN_sPRSEOu6zDYgu8lU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111300%252Fa1436829-b98c-4d38-ae79-959b343ca60d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=C-U6l2-zjdbVzqTadRpeyn-D8KY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111300%252Fa1436829-b98c-4d38-ae79-959b343ca60d.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=eplinDjhTlVvFYBo92gg8O6d1ao=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111300%252Fa1436829-b98c-4d38-ae79-959b343ca60d.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=aybEk0Rexq82koRVy1nSCkwmrwM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111300%252Fa1436829-b98c-4d38-ae79-959b343ca60d.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=dyZE4JatnpPq6VyAdmxn7U6TBqs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Kirsty Black, the PhD researcher who spearheaded the pea gin project.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-gin-garden-peas.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-gin-garden-peas.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1224302%252F900d089d-4fc0-4a12-b9f3-52b46a88fc1b.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=HFQ7Ry13EmWmbvOW3djJUrVSlaQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1224302%252F900d089d-4fc0-4a12-b9f3-52b46a88fc1b.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=oNHkJYn3VB-5zCyRBAhFyVkG-mU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Kirsty Black, the PhD researcher who spearheaded the pea gin project."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  abertay university"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Scientists made an environmentally friendly gin from peas.

This could make Heathrow, by far, the busiest airport on Earth.\nBut three UK judges on Thursday blocked the construction of a new, more than 10,000-foot-long stretch of asphalt. In a lawsuit brought by environmental groups, the judges found the government's runway plan failed to consider how the added air traffic — which will emit prodigious amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide — would impact the UK's commitment to slash its carbon emissions, as agreed to in the historic Paris climate accords.\nThe lapse is \"legally fatal\" to the runway plans, the judges wrote.\n\"The Paris Agreement ought to have been taken into account by the Secretary of State in the preparation of the [runway plans] and an explanation given as to how it was taken into account, but it was not,\" they said. \nThe new runway, however, could still potentially get built one day — if Heathrow explains how it wouldn't hinder the nation's aims to ambitiously slash carbon emissions. (The judges emphasized they can't totally ban a third runway, only that the plans for the runway didn't take into account the nation's Paris commitments.) \nBut when it comes to carbon emissions, airplanes have a big problem. That's because big airliners — which make up around 95 percent of commercial aviation emissions — will continue to burn liquid fuels, at least through much of the century. \"We will continue to use jet fuel for as far as the eye can see,\" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said earlier in Februray. And jet fuels are largely made from oil products. \n\nBREAKING: We won! Today we blocked the Tory government plans to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport.Today’s judgment is a major victory for all Londoners who are passionate about tackling the climate emergency and cleaning up our air.  https://t.co/59MEn2X6Lw— Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) February 27, 2020\n\nIf airlines want to boldly slash emissions, however, they have an option: fuels made from plants, commonly called biofuels. Yes, when burned in an engine, biofuels will still emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But, critically, biofuels don't require that any new oil be fracked and drilled out of the Earth, adding new sources of CO2 to the air. \n\"Instead of releasing carbon as CO2 that’s been in the earth for billions of years, this is from a plant,” Andrew Sutton, who works on the chemical energy storage team at Los Alamos National Laboratory, told Mashable. \nIt is possible, though challenging, for airlines to ramp up their use of biofuels over the next 10 or 15 years, explained aviation engineer Timothy Takahashi. But there's very little infrastructure and production of biofuels today. These greener fuels made up less than one-tenth of one percent of aviation fuels burned in 2018.\nIf future planes passing through Heathrow ran on biofuels, perhaps the airport could justify the addition of a new runway, and tens of millions more annual passengers.\nSEE ALSO: What, exactly, does Congress understand about the world's most threatening glacier?\nThere's also a hot buzzword in the aviation industry that can play a smaller role in helping any airline, or airport, meet it ambitious climate targets: carbon offsets. The practice involves paying for projects that absorb carbon dioxide from the air (conserving land, planting trees) or technology that replaces fossil fuel burning (wind and solar projects) to offset carbon dioxide released.\nThe problem is that planting lots of trees, for example, doesn't slow civilization's rising carbon emissions, nor does it immediately soak up carbon from the air. Even if 1 trillion trees were planted on Earth by 2050, it wouldn't remotely solve Earth's growing carbon emissions problem. And, of course, there's the increasing problem of forests burning down in a hotter climate, which pumps carbon dioxide right back into the atmosphere.\nMeanwhile, new wind farms are great, but those wind farms will not stop planes from emitting carbon into the atmosphere — and global carbon emissons must drop to zero for the planet to stop warming. \nImportantly, the aviation industry today already emits more carbon into the atmosphere than nearly every nation on Earth, and aviation CO2 emissions have risen by 32 percent since 2013. Around 20,000 planes fly around Earth today, but some 50,000 planes are projected to take to the air by 2040.\nAirplane traffic is expected to triple in the next 25 years.\nUnless airlines rapidly transition to biofuels, more runways will almost certainly mean much more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1224321%252F849bac6d-a40b-4293-bb51-806cac13efc2.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=WgUVKGywmV5ZgYrGsmVzxbSi3Fw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111305%252F3b842003-0cd5-4780-9f05-4795adba0770.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=26tA89dyGlQaPi086xndx-TDVbM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111305%252F3b842003-0cd5-4780-9f05-4795adba0770.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=J1g5TkNkkuT8EsDs4glz2hXhIUA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111305%252F3b842003-0cd5-4780-9f05-4795adba0770.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=uwJnuD81UAwOHoRhFmL_Cs-kR8M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111305%252F3b842003-0cd5-4780-9f05-4795adba0770.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=inTTBtOd3h5kxhwQBvrGRwK3zOE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111305%252F3b842003-0cd5-4780-9f05-4795adba0770.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=QxMBqB0QAVfc3HnF6L0Ddy-0oz8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-heathrow-airport-runway-blocked-climate-change.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-heathrow-airport-runway-blocked-climate-change.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1224321%252F849bac6d-a40b-4293-bb51-806cac13efc2.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=gIDxqg9yW-VxL0Zvrg1u8OmrexM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1224321%252F849bac6d-a40b-4293-bb51-806cac13efc2.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=4Z039hukNd78gYeKZC4ms5XE0Bo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Shutterstock / Ian Schofield"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Major new airport runway nixed because of the warming planet","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The attempted expansion would make Heathrow, by far, the busiest airport on Earth.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Science","channel_label":"Science","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Science/","tweet_text":"Major new airport runway nixed because of the warming planet"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":4212}

But today's wide-scale shutdown of cities, extreme social distancing measures, and plummeting transportation usage will have no immediate, meaningful impact on Earth's colossal carbon dioxide woes or the planet's relentless warming trend.\nThe rising atmospheric concentrations of the potent heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide — now at its highest levels in at least 800,000 years, but more likely millions of years — hasn't slowed much, if at all. And an event that will cost countless lives wasn't ever a climate fix, anyhow.\n\"This is not anyone’s idea of a solution to the climate crisis,\" said Kristopher Karnauskas, a climate scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder.\nSlowing down the rise in CO2 will mean big, long-term societal changes. If widespread economic shutdowns persist through the coming months, we'll likely see a slowing down of rising CO2 numbers in the atmosphere. But, critically, this won't make a dent in the mass, or pile, of carbon dioxide we've built up over the last 150 years. \n\"The pile is still there,\" said Ralph Keeling, the director of the Scripps CO2 Program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \"We're not getting rid of the pile.\"\nTo better understand, let's look at the big picture, and then zoom in.\nThe big, big picture\nThe graph below shows how Earth's carbon dioxide emissions have skyrocketed in the last century or so. Compared to the last 800,000 years, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are rising sharply.\n\nThe last 60 years\nHere, we can see that atmospheric CO2 numbers have kept rising, unabated, since the 1960s. (The red, saw-like line shows how each year atmospheric CO2 levels also naturally rise and fall when the great forests of the Northern Hemisphere gulp up CO2 during the warm seasons, and then release it back into the atmosphere in the fall.) \n\nThe last year\nBelow is a zoomed-in look at CO2 numbers over the last year. We can see one of the seasonal drops, or valleys, amid the incessantly rising CO2 numbers. There might be a slight slowdown in February and March — maybe partly attributable to China's colossal coronavirus shutdown — but nothing extreme or beyond what could have happened naturally. \n\"There's not much suggestion yet of a clear turndown in the growth rate,\" said Keeling.\nBut, if global economies continue to slow during these periods of extreme social isolation and business closures, a slowing trend could become more apparent in the coming months, Keeling said. \n\nYet, the big picture is clear: Earth has a massive stockpile of accumulated CO2. The pandemic might temporarily slow the relentless growth of these emissions, but it will hardly make a dent in the overall problem (see above: \"The big, big picture.\") The pandemic alone won’t impact the long-term, amassing CO2 trend we’ve seen over the last century.\nWhat's more, countries will seek to stimulate their stagnant economies, like the $2 trillion dollar spending bill in Congress — which would be the biggest single stimulus in the nation's history. These robust stimulus efforts will boost carbon emissions, as the industrialized world largely runs on fossil fuels.\n\"There’s going to be some kind of rebound,\" said Karnauskas. \"They’re going to work double-time to make up for it.\"\nIf CO₂ emissions drop an extreme 10% in 2020, would we see it in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations?Unlikely. ~45% of CO₂ emissions remain in the atmosphere: ~42*0.45=19GtCO₂/yr.A 10% drop would mean ~17GtCO₂/yr. Well within natural variability!https://t.co/2MNQn6JRCI pic.twitter.com/19HF4re9qE— Glen Peters (@Peters_Glen) March 23, 2020\n\nLooking more like a one-time drop in year-to-date CO2 change, and if it had anything to do with #COVIDー19, perhaps due to China's measures? https://t.co/SXkCWFV231 pic.twitter.com/TqYq2S1Jif— Kris Karnauskas (@OceansClimateCU) March 22, 2020\n\nThere is, however, the possibility that this historic pandemic will drive longer-term societal changes that permanently slow the rise in atmospheric carbon concentrations. \n\"When we come out of this, how does it change our behavior?\" asked Keeling. \"The world won’t be the same when we come out of this.\"\nAfter months of not flying, commuting less, and working from home, perhaps there will be permanent shifts in how we choose to live. This could mean using less energy, emitting less carbon, and eventually lowering the CO2 in our atmosphere.\nSEE ALSO: You can't kill the coronavirus. That's OK.\nBut, these CO2 concentrations will still keep going up until we drop carbon emissions to zero, emphasized Karnauskas. We're far, far, far away from achieving that. In 2019, for example, carbon emissions rose to their highest levels ever. Humanity dumped some 38.6 billion tons of CO2 into the air last year. Reducing that to zero will take herculean changes.\nOnce society curbs this pandemic — if we commit to following critical social distancing measures — it will be easy to see if we ultimately cut emissions.

Although Arctic sea ice this season reached its biggest extent since 2013, it's still significantly lower than it was four decades ago. The Arctic is the fastest-warming region on Earth, and though there will always be fluctuating winters, sea ice is in a deep decline. \n\"While this year's maximum sea ice extent was a bump up from the last few years, it is still well below average and far from conditions in the 1980s and 1990s,\" said Zack Labe, a climate scientist and Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Irvine. \n\"The bottom line is that the Arctic is still trending over the long term toward less extensive ice cover throughout the year, but with year to year variations,\" agreed Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. \nSimilarly, the official announcement has been made by the @NSIDC (https://t.co/k9tBTaVJmL) ---> \"The 2020 maximum sea ice extent is the eleventh lowest in the 42-year satellite record.\" Small differences in ranking are expected between sea ice data sets. pic.twitter.com/RZOwdZmjdX— Zack Labe (@ZLabe) March 24, 2020\n\nOfficially, after a pretty cold Arctic winter, the maximum, or largest, amount of sea ice was the eleventh lowest in 42 years of satellite record-keeping, which was the highest in eight years. \"It doesn’t in any way indicate a rebound, but rather year-to-year variations, which we expect to see,\" said Meier.\nThe colder winter was largely caused by a well-known fluctuating weather pattern, called the Arctic Oscillation. This year, zones of high pressure below the Arctic kept the cooler Arctic air, and the infamous polar vortex, locked in place. That meant an increase in sea ice. But nothing extreme. \nIt's dark in the high north over winter, but overall, the Arctic suffers from a vicious sun-related cycle that decimates its ice. It's called the albedo effect, wherein bright white sea ice melts (often due to warmer air temperatures). This leaves large swathes of dark ocean exposed to absorb more heat from the sun, which warms the ocean and in turn melts more ice. It's a relentless feedback loop of melting. \nBy the end of summer, this leaves sea ice profoundly melted before each winter begins.\n\"The 13 lowest [sea ice] extents in the satellite era have all occurred in the last 13 years,\" the National Snow and Ice Data Center said last year. \nAnd just like that, Bering Sea #seaice extent has declined more than 35% from its March 12 maximum; March 25 extent is the 4th lowest in the 42 year @NSIDC satellite era. Big losses Gulf of Anadyr and southeast Bering. #akwx #Arctic @Climatologist49 @seaice_de @KNOMnews @ZLabe pic.twitter.com/MFIp86hmWA— Rick Thoman (@AlaskaWx) March 26, 2020\n\nDramatic decline of sea ice cover in the Bering Sea (near Alaska) during the last week. This is a result of a change in weather conditions (e.g., southerly winds; https://t.co/HdIFf8Vm7V). Data from @NSIDC. pic.twitter.com/nOXWBZesGC— Zack Labe (@ZLabe) March 25, 2020\n\nOn top of the Arctic's relentless warming trend, fluctuating weather will always play a role in shaping the extent and volume of sea ice. Sometimes this will lead to bumps in sea ice, and sometimes dips. \n\"Changes in daily weather conditions play a major role in the evolution of Arctic sea ice,\" said Labe.\nSEE ALSO: Coronavirus won’t make a dent in the climate problem\nFor example, storms and winds have decimated sea ice in the Bering Sea over the last week. This rapidly dropped Arctic sea ice to its fourth-lowest levels, for this time of year, on record. \nBut the big picture remains clear. The climate situation remains unchanged. Earth is relentlessly warming — 19 of the last 20 years are the warmest on record — and the Arctic is dramatically changing.\n\"The basic story is the same, but this year represents a bit of an upward 'bump' on the overall downward trend,\" said Meier."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1256877%252F4cf2ab5e-95ef-4fdc-903b-72e4a506d09d.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=L9Glu5gGT3-Cp7F_UhEu8_sXOZk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=RbeE1oJ2XaXKSgzgpOAAa9yxOtg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F356x205.png?signature=CrspPZTWkdOXQ1AEpnlQDEtbz20=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F712x410.png?signature=W2pJYNsHXQ18f-f-UJjuSOTKzR0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F280x157.png?signature=J4339kFbN9TDjy76Y5Uj5hZqtsY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F560x314.png?signature=iuNxRHHlPq-jsMPoAGgce3qJP3I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Even after a frigid winter, Arctic sea ice is still really low","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F356x205.png?signature=CrspPZTWkdOXQ1AEpnlQDEtbz20=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=8532EATI5nVSRGhqAXCItZzk9L8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=JQG7r9vbF6HLiOuJ0fPzYCuQb0k=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F280x157.png?signature=J4339kFbN9TDjy76Y5Uj5hZqtsY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112647%252Ffda4afba-4b9d-4500-b806-6f56fe703c37.png%252F356x205.png?signature=CrspPZTWkdOXQ1AEpnlQDEtbz20=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Even after a frigid winter, Arctic sea ice is still really low","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"It is still well below average.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Science","channel_label":"Science","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Science/","tweet_text":"Even after a frigid winter, Arctic sea ice is still really low"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":4}

But today's wide-scale shutdown of cities, extreme social distancing measures, and plummeting transportation usage will have no immediate, meaningful impact on Earth's colossal carbon dioxide woes or the planet's relentless warming trend.\nThe rising atmospheric concentrations of the potent heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide — now at its highest levels in at least 800,000 years, but more likely millions of years — hasn't slowed much, if at all. And an event that will cost countless lives wasn't ever a climate fix, anyhow.\n\"This is not anyone’s idea of a solution to the climate crisis,\" said Kristopher Karnauskas, a climate scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder.\nSlowing down the rise in CO2 will mean big, long-term societal changes. If widespread economic shutdowns persist through the coming months, we'll likely see a slowing down of rising CO2 numbers in the atmosphere. But, critically, this won't make a dent in the mass, or pile, of carbon dioxide we've built up over the last 150 years. \n\"The pile is still there,\" said Ralph Keeling, the director of the Scripps CO2 Program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \"We're not getting rid of the pile.\"\nTo better understand, let's look at the big picture, and then zoom in.\nThe big, big picture\nThe graph below shows how Earth's carbon dioxide emissions have skyrocketed in the last century or so. Compared to the last 800,000 years, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are rising sharply.\n\nThe last 60 years\nHere, we can see that atmospheric CO2 numbers have kept rising, unabated, since the 1960s. (The red, saw-like line shows how each year atmospheric CO2 levels also naturally rise and fall when the great forests of the Northern Hemisphere gulp up CO2 during the warm seasons, and then release it back into the atmosphere in the fall.) \n\nThe last year\nBelow is a zoomed-in look at CO2 numbers over the last year. We can see one of the seasonal drops, or valleys, amid the incessantly rising CO2 numbers. There might be a slight slowdown in February and March — maybe partly attributable to China's colossal coronavirus shutdown — but nothing extreme or beyond what could have happened naturally. \n\"There's not much suggestion yet of a clear turndown in the growth rate,\" said Keeling.\nBut, if global economies continue to slow during these periods of extreme social isolation and business closures, a slowing trend could become more apparent in the coming months, Keeling said. \n\nYet, the big picture is clear: Earth has a massive stockpile of accumulated CO2. The pandemic might temporarily slow the relentless growth of these emissions, but it will hardly make a dent in the overall problem (see above: \"The big, big picture.\") The pandemic alone won’t impact the long-term, amassing CO2 trend we’ve seen over the last century.\nWhat's more, countries will seek to stimulate their stagnant economies, like the $2 trillion dollar spending bill in Congress — which would be the biggest single stimulus in the nation's history. These robust stimulus efforts will boost carbon emissions, as the industrialized world largely runs on fossil fuels.\n\"There’s going to be some kind of rebound,\" said Karnauskas. \"They’re going to work double-time to make up for it.\"\nIf CO₂ emissions drop an extreme 10% in 2020, would we see it in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations?Unlikely. ~45% of CO₂ emissions remain in the atmosphere: ~42*0.45=19GtCO₂/yr.A 10% drop would mean ~17GtCO₂/yr.

This could mean using less energy, emitting less carbon, and eventually lowering the CO2 in our atmosphere.\nSEE ALSO: You can't kill the coronavirus. That's OK.\nBut, these CO2 concentrations will still keep going up until we drop carbon emissions to zero, emphasized Karnauskas. We're far, far, far away from achieving that. In 2019, for example, carbon emissions rose to their highest levels ever. Humanity dumped some 38.6 billion tons of CO2 into the air last year. Reducing that to zero will take herculean changes.\nOnce society curbs this pandemic — if we commit to following critical social distancing measures — it will be easy to see if we ultimately cut emissions. Atmospheric carbon concentrations don't lie. They've been going up for well over a century. \n\"You can’t hide the emissions,\" said Karnauskas."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=hNBX5zlLd-sViOTsmplWYMkGhDo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=f5eHcPkgoI62bJmYb21Z4lvYkaM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F356x205.png?signature=eCtx1KB17hQ9ZPv0s5d0xD-Kuu0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F712x410.png?signature=oKhsXRGZXKzDbBnoiTBt32hy-PA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F280x157.png?signature=T8rCmr7s4Vph-1hk1u9CD7kvgYw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F560x314.png?signature=wMnTWgV8KtSw1tINDHJa0mY26J8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Coronavirus won’t make a dent in the climate problem","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F356x205.png?signature=eCtx1KB17hQ9ZPv0s5d0xD-Kuu0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F280x157.png?signature=T8rCmr7s4Vph-1hk1u9CD7kvgYw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112517%252Fdb8018a4-2674-40d4-bc5c-f595f339ad2d.png%252F356x205.png?signature=eCtx1KB17hQ9ZPv0s5d0xD-Kuu0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Coronavirus won’t make a dent in the climate problem","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"We're not getting rid of the pile.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Science","channel_label":"Science","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Science/","tweet_text":"Coronavirus won’t make a dent in the climate problem"},{"_id":"5e6bb1d2f11b2c54a4000054","id":"/article/antarctica-greenland-melting-gigatonne-ice/","title":"NASA sticks a colossal ice block in NYC in new video","title_tag":null,"author":"Mark Kaufman","post_date":"2020-03-13T16:16:17+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 16:16:17 +0000","formatted_date":"03/13/2020","sort_key":"1JcShE","link":"https://mashable.com/article/antarctica-greenland-melting-gigatonne-ice/","content":{"plain":"The greatest masses of ice on Earth, in Antarctica and Greenland, aren't just melting — this melt is accelerating. \nHow much ice are these critical polar regions losing into the oceans?

And Greenland's rate of melt has accelerated by seven times since the 1990s.\nBoth of these historically unprecedented events are ultimately driven by a relentlessly heating planet, as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations continue to skyrocket. \nIn Greenland — home to an ice sheet two and a half times the size of Texas — a warming atmosphere is driving much of this melt. Meanwhile, in Antarctica, warmer ocean waters are eating away at the ends of glaciers that float over the ocean, known as ice shelves. This poses a giant problem. \nThe mighty Thwaites glacier, one of the largest glaciers on Earth, lies in Antarctica. Warmer ocean waters are melting away the ice shelf at a \"tremendous rate,\" and in the coming decades the glacier may pass the point of no return — meaning unstoppable amounts of Thwaites' ice on the Antarctic continent will pour into the sea.\n\"Thwaites is the one spot in Antarctica that has the potential to dump an enormous amount of water into the ocean over the next decades,\" Sridhar Anandakrishnan, a professor of glaciology at Penn State University, told Mashable. \nSEE ALSO: What, exactly, does Congress understand about the world's most threatening glacier?\nThwaites alone could trigger over two feet of sea level rise this century. \nAlready, though, many gigatons of ice are pouring in the sea. Under extremely optimistic (if not nearly impossible) scenarios wherein global society curbs Earth's warming at an ambitious 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-Industrial Revolution temperatures, the relatively conservative UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects around two feet of sea level rise this century.\nBut it could be more, much more. This depends on how much society curbs its carbon emissions in the coming decade and beyond, and potentially stabilizes the warming climate."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1244199%252Fc16063fe-b340-4178-aaec-a43e6fcdf694.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=0dWJayduj3PNsAqI7SOsm9uRzNU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=rEhkkVIPhp5RQ2Sz-4UbtEo2vXk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F356x205.png?signature=pgkUgU6FxLaHDX61eNbDoPhEeo0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F712x410.png?signature=o7lzQK0WpxHrCBFWRoqDEVn_6Bs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F280x157.png?signature=9lOXikS3TbR8GikwJPWlnP9QhaU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F560x314.png?signature=mdmQmduyJKLU7CWb1SaSodJjHKM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"NASA sticks a colossal ice block in NYC in new video","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F356x205.png?signature=pgkUgU6FxLaHDX61eNbDoPhEeo0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=i5mJwyVP37dFqpfn9W-v1WkWBu4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=W0krCOUUu6qNg7nxuOcWAjH4gA8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F280x157.png?signature=9lOXikS3TbR8GikwJPWlnP9QhaU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111966%252F990df7c1-ddf4-4aa5-aa05-4327a488e00e.png%252F356x205.png?signature=pgkUgU6FxLaHDX61eNbDoPhEeo0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"NASA sticks a colossal ice block in NYC in new video","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG2WMQ0N","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"What does a gigatonne of ice look like?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Science","channel_label":"Science","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Science/","tweet_text":"NASA sticks a colossal ice block in NYC in new video"},{"_id":"5e62c740f11b2c09b400002d","id":"/article/shell-international-womens-day/","title":"Shell will change its name to She'll for International Women's Day, effectively solving sexism","title_tag":null,"author":"Morgan Sung","post_date":"2020-03-06T21:57:19+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 06 Mar 2020 21:57:19 +0000","formatted_date":"03/06/2020","sort_key":"1Jawjg","link":"https://mashable.com/article/shell-international-womens-day/","content":{"plain":"In a stunning display of performative feminism, Shell is changing its name to She'll for International Women's Day. \nWell, one Shell.

This realm, found under a nearly 2,000-foot-thick slab of ice in Antarctica, is where one of the planet's largest glaciers, the Florida-sized Thwaites Glacier, meets the rocky ocean floor.\nAntarctic scientists are fixated on this subterranean place, called Thwaites' \"grounding zone.\" It acts like a brake, holding Thwaites back from purging unstoppable rivers of ice into the sea, which alone could raise sea levels by over two feet — but may unleash up to eight more feet of sea level rise from its glacial neighbors. \"Thwaites is the one spot in Antarctica that has the potential to dump an enormous amount of water into the ocean over the next decades,\" said Sridhar Anandakrishnan, a professor of glaciology at Penn State University. This critical meeting of ice and rock is retreating back around half a mile each year, and researchers long suspected warmer ocean waters were to blame. They were right. \nFor the first time, a team of scientists in January adventured to Thwaites' stormy, icy plains, and drilled a hole to the elusive grounding zone. They lowered a probe down the 2,000-foot void and discovered the saltwater was 2 degrees above freezing. That's bad, if you're a glacier. \"That's really warm for a glacier,\" said David Holland, the director of New York University’s Environmental Fluid Dynamics Laboratory who traveled to Antarctica for the recent expedition. \"That's why the glacier is thinning and retreating.\"\nHow quickly will Thwaites melt? Even 10 years out, we don't know what Thwaites will look like. \"It's completely unclear,\" said Anandakrishnan.\nWhat's clear, however, is Thwaites' relentless retreat, ultimately driven by a warming atmosphere. These changes are far outside the realm of what most members of Congress — empowered to make supreme laws of the land that determine the nation's fate — can easily grasp. There's good news and pretty bad news when it comes to what the 535 members of Congress realize about the most threatening glacier on Earth — and critically, the necessity to rapidly slash carbon emissions to potentially curb Thwaites' melt. \nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, is a champion of climate change, having now given 265 speeches on the Senate floor about the heating climate. But Whitehouse acknowledges his colleagues, particularly Republicans, have little to no clue about the momentous observations U.S. scientists are now making in Earth's remote, but increasingly ominous, polar regions.\n\"The bubble senators live in is fairly artificial,\" said Whitehouse. \"They're in a disconnected position from reality.\" (This doesn’t apply just to Republicans. Democrats, however, are the party that almost exclusively calls for cutting carbon emissions.)\nAccordingly, the U.S. Senate, a place once described as \"composed of eloquent advocates\" and \"wise magistrates,\" is doing very little to drive meaningful climate policy. What's more, senators don't see a path forward today, especially when President Donald Trump, who dismissed a dire, years-in-the-making, congressionally-mandated climate report from top U.S. scientists, sits at the Resolute desk.\n\"We're not doing much legislatively,\" Whitehouse acknowledged. \"People will look at [this time] as a dark era in American history.\"\n\nBut for Whitehouse, at least, the deluge of unsettling news out of Antarctica, including a recent bout of Los Angeles-like temperatures, throws more wood on the fire. \n\"It's motivating as hell,\" Whitehouse said. \"It gives you that dreadful feeling when something you fear might happen suddenly becomes more immediate.\" \nUnlike the Senate, however, the House of Representatives is commanded by a powerful Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, who in 2019 created the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. The committee's job is to create a grand report to make \"ambitious climate policy recommendations to Congress.\" It's chaired by Rep. Kathy Castor, a Democrat from Florida, perhaps the state most vulnerable to rising seas (a live octopus even washed into a Miami parking garage during high tide).\n\"It's motivating as hell.\"\nCastor said her committee is on the cusp of releasing this unprecedented report, the Congressional Climate Action Framework, by the end of March. \n\"It will help the U.S. prepare for some of the worst impacts of climate change — including the effects of a destabilized Antarctica,\" Castor said. \nThe report's basic framework prioritizes listening to scientists and slashing carbon pollution, but also includes preparing for climate-enhanced disasters, like more intense, pummeling storms. That's wise, because it's almost certain global civilization will blow through the warming limit set by the historic U.N. Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 Fahrenheit, above 19th-century levels. That means markedly more severe, extreme weather.\nThe need to curb warming, even if we miss the most ambitious climate targets, is at least well understood by many of Castor's Democratic colleagues. \"There is a hunger for action,\" she said. \"We have to get to net-zero carbon emissions as fast as possible.\"\n\nThe problem, of course, is Castor might not get much help from Republicans, who since the 1980s have been deeply suspicious of environmental science. Today, it's a refusal to listen to climate scientists. This party could largely be Thwaites' undoing, as the U.S. is the second-biggest carbon emitter on Earth and the largest historical carbon polluter overall. \"The Republicans have made opposition to climate change a rallying cry for the conservative grassroots,\" James Turner, a U.S. environmental historian at Wellesley College, told Mashable after a sad showing by the United States at a major climate conference in December 2018. \nThe Republican climate plan is the recently unveiled Trillion Trees Act, which aims to plant 1 trillion trees globally by 2050 to soak up carbon from the air — while ignoring the reality that fire-ravaged American forests are already suffering from gross overcrowding. \"We have an obligation to conserve our resources and make them available to future generations, and I challenge anyone to find a better climate solution than taking care of our forests,\" Rep. Bruce Westerman, a Republican of Arkansas, said in a statement. Planting 1 trillion trees would absorb carbon, but it wouldn't remotely solve Earth's growing carbon emissions problem.\nAnd by 2050, Thwaites may have already collapsed.\nBut it's unlikely Republicans will support actually slashing carbon emissions anytime soon. In March 2019, Castor introduced a simple bill in the House, the Climate Action Now Act, which sought to do the bare minimum on climate policy: keep the U.S. from leaving the Paris Agreement. \"We had only three Republicans vote for that very simple resolution,\" said Castor. (The Senate hasn't taken it up.) \nAt the Trump administration's behest, the U.S. will officially leave the climate agreement in November, the only nation to do so. This won't help slow Thwaites' retreat, which is more serious than the whole of Congress realizes. \n\"It is a tremendous rate of retreat,\" said Penn State's Anandakrishnan. \nThwaites could very well fulfill its fate as a \"Doomsday Glacier,\" melting past its grounding zone and then relentlessly dumping ice into the sea.\n\"These things are coming to get us.\"\n\"We've never watched this happen before,\" said Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"Those ocean temperature numbers right at the grounding line are a sign that Antarctica is really in trouble.\"\nShould Congress treat Thwaites' underwater melting — in a place so remote and whose collapse could be decades away — as an immediate threat? \"All signs point to it being a big deal,\" emphasized Willis.\nMany members of today's Congress will be long dead, in a few decades. But they'll have had the opportunity to listen to scientists bringing back grim news from the farthest reaches of the planet. Thwaites' consequences, already contributing 4 percent to global sea level rise, will be seen everywhere. \"These things are coming to get us,\" said Willis. \nBut in Washington, Thwaites has a big disadvantage: the prodigious amounts of money fossil fuel companies give to Congress. As a new study starkly concluded, \"The more a given member of Congress votes against environmental policies, the more contributions they receive from oil and gas companies supporting their reelection.\" Led by Koch Industries, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron, oil and gas lobbyists spent $124,697,322 in 2019. That's how you buy votes. \n\"The whole thing floats on a sea of smelly, dark money,\" said Whitehouse.\n\nThe brighter news, noted Whitehouse, is that the U.S. electorate overall now sees climate change as a critical, top-tier problem. And the Democrats running for president generally have robust, unprecedented climate plans. \"That's a very positive feeling,\" he said. \nBut, noted Castor, any significant climate policy to reduce still-skyrocketing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere (which are now rising at rates that are unprecedented in historic and geologic history) may have to contend with powerful Republicans.

It's a swarm of ravenous locusts. \nA biologist at Penn State University, David Hughes, posted footage of locusts swarming over Kenya on Saturday. Hughes is working with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN FAO) to research the growing locust plagues in Kenya — which the U.N. says could be the worst in 70 years.\nLocust plagues, numbering in the billions of frenzied, flying grasshoppers, are essentially impossible to stop once they've grown wings and swarm over hundreds of square miles of land, \"We’re not going to solve this problem as a human society anytime soon,\" Rick Overson, the research coordinator at Arizona State University's Global Locust Initiative, told Mashable in January.\nThe two videos below, posted by Hughes, show the current swarms in Kenya. In the first video, a likely member of a locust survey runs through the yellow swarm to illustrate the insects' massive numbers. \n.@FAO survey on shores Lake Turkana (Northern Kenya) to assess swarm.

Since Oct. 2019, East Africa has been hit with unusually heavy rains, noted the World Meteorological Organization.\nEast Africa's heavy rains may have been boosted by the warming climate, too. The powerful storms were stoked by a normal climate pattern that creates warmer temperatures in the Indian Ocean, known as the Indian Ocean Dipole. \nBut, “Global warming is making these dipoles stronger,\" Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said in a statement. \"The Indian Ocean Dipole of 2019 was particularly stronger than the earlier ones. As a result, the cyclone activity over the west Indian Ocean was also exceptional — in terms of the number of cyclones and intensity.\"\nOver 90 percent of the heat trapped on Earth by humans gets soaked up by the seas, which boosts overall ocean temperatures.\nSEE ALSO: Why the warming oceans will get louder\nThe current locust swarms aren't expected to die out anytime soon. In fact, the Climate Prediction and Application Center (ICPAC), an intergovernmental African organization, warns that eggs laid by the current swarm of locusts will hatch in March and April, which will create a \"second round of invasion.\" \nLocusts frequently devour crops, which, critically, are often people's sustenance.  \"Under a worse-case scenario, the desert locusts will invade key production areas/bread-baskets of the region and cause significant crop losses during the March to May cropping season, and could potentially worsen the food security situation,\" ICPAC said. \n\nTo fend off future super-swarms, the U.N. and locust researchers must dramatically improve predictions of where and when the swarms will form, so nations can quell the locust populations with chemical insecticides before they become untamable plagues.\nBut locust species inhabit some 6 million square miles of land in Africa and the Middle East — so it's daunting to pinpoint where, exactly, the locusts will start swarming.\n\"It's not surprising to me that we still don’t have a grip on this,\" Iain Couzin, the director of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior who researches locust swarms, told Mashable in January."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1217302%252F2dbba47a-a84c-43f1-b87e-24b9113fa428.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=SPnJpnWmDMDCm3VCJbOVT0DQqoY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111120%252F34b629b5-b3c7-48f6-b462-ee30dfd607f8.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=X6QIKwnZiGstSQ4trlzvSaQuLYc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111120%252F34b629b5-b3c7-48f6-b462-ee30dfd607f8.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=AkJXUC3SmFIJiiipxOcQwVdS60k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111120%252F34b629b5-b3c7-48f6-b462-ee30dfd607f8.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=THZWVp2pYk-cPESWw1-MpdW7AOI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

of climate change delivered a record-setting 65-degree day in the icy continent of Antarctica. Now you can see what that warming actually looks like.\nThe first image below is from Feb. 4, just a couple days before the arrival of the warm temperatures that lingered in the region through Feb. 13. The second photo shows us what that same region looks like after a week of higher-than-average temperatures.\nIn case it's not clear, a lot of that ice and snow started to recede or disappear entirely by the time the heat wave ended.\n\nThe record temperature of 18.3 degrees Celsus (or roughly 64 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded on the Antarctic Peninsula, found at the northern end of the continent. The images above capture that same area, and you should pay particular attention to Eagle Island, the landmass near the botton of each image.\nYou can very clearly see how the snow accumulation has receded in the later photo, with more areas of exposed ground and rock. The light blue patch visible at the center of the island in the later photo is also notable as an example of how the snow is melting.\nMauri Pelto, a glaciologist at Nichols College, identified the blue patch as a \"melt pond,\" or a pool of water that formed on top of the ice as snow melted, in a report from NASA's Earth Observatory.  “I haven’t seen melt ponds develop this quickly in Antarctica. You see these kinds of melt events in Alaska and Greenland, but not usually in Antarctica,\" Pelto said.\nSEE ALSO: Scientists stuck cameras on 30 Antarctic whales and captured this wild footage\nWhile the above images offer a dramatic example of the increasingly-hard-to-ignore effects of climate change, it's even more alarming that February's stretch of warmer temperatures in the Antarctic region was the third of the current season, following similar events in Nov. 2019 and Jan. 2020.\nThe images above were captured by the Operational Land Imager, a very high-tech camera (it's

The researchers found the already-clamorous species become markedly louder when introduced to warmer temperatures, and will present their research Friday at the 2020 Ocean Sciences Meeting.\n\"The sea is a pretty noisy place,\" said Aran Mooney, a marine biologist at Woods Hole who coauthored the research.\n\"We’ve been worried about human-produced noise in the ocean,\" he said. \"But we haven't thought about natural sounds.\" \nThe sound of snapping shrimp (which is likely an involuntary, automatic response) in coral and oyster reefs is truly ubiquitous. \"If you're listening to a healthy coastal ecosystem, you’ll hear snapping shrimp,\" said Michelle Fournet, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Conservation Bioacoustics at Cornell University. \n\"We hear them almost every hour of every day,\" Fournet, who had no involvement in the research, added.\nEach \"snap\" is made when shrimp quickly close their claws and pop a little bubble of air. Listen for yourself:\n\nThe Woods Hole researchers exposed the shrimp to three main temperatures: 10 degrees Celsius (50 F), 20 C (68 F), and 30 C (86 F). For reference, the shrimp usually experience 10 C temperatures in the winter, and about 28 C during the summer.\nThe difference in noise levels between 10 C and 30 C, measured in decibels, was dramatic. In the warmer conditions, the snapping was 20 decibels louder, which equates to being ten times as loud, explained Wood Hole's Mooney.\n\"It's already pretty loud\"\nOverall, ocean temperatures have risen by about 2 F over the last 100 years, so each season, whether summer or winter, presumably has boosted overall temperatures and loudness, explained Mooney.\nCritically, the U.N. International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects surface ocean waters to warm by at least another 1 degree Fahrenheit or so by 2050. The warming will continue until human-made carbon emissions drop to zero — and there's no evidence of that happening for at least decades. (Emissions are still on the rise.) \nThe link between temperature and snapping is clear, said Mooney, and suggests that it's almost certainly going to get louder in ocean reefs, which teem with life (Though, like all novel research, these compelling results must be reproduced again). The looming question, however, is what does this boost in noise mean for ocean animals?\n\n\"The ecological implications of this are wide open,\" said Cornell's Fournet. \n\"We don't know what these effects are,\" agreed Mooney.\nThis research opens up the door to find answers, he said, by further researching snapping shrimp and animals, potentially in wild places.\nLouder environments could easily cause problems for fish and other creatures. The boosted volume can mask sounds of the reef, as animals look for food or avoid predators. To us, reefs might appear quiet, but when recorded with underwater microphones, it's a bustling place. Toadfish whistle, groupers make low-frequency sounds, and many fish \"puff.\"\n\"Fish make a lot more sounds than people think,\" said Fournet.\nSEE ALSO: Even the 'optimistic' climate change forecast is catastrophic\nOr, the amplified snapping could be like having excessively loud neighbors, said Mooney. In that case, the noise would be incessantly stressful. \nAlready, civilization's warming of the oceans — stoked by dramatically boosted levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to amounts likely not seen in millions of years — has resulted in animals fleeing from their homes and may also blind some sea creatures.\nNow, we're likely altering the way their world sounds.\n\"We’re changing the soundscape,\" said Mooney."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1212434%252Fba1665a1-6ffa-4395-ae29-a942a21970e6.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=-7h5hEkz2jF_HAwQ4IVMHqbe9T4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110995%252F4f9364f7-535d-4413-ac4f-a1dcdc3cc1f8.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=wlcqwFgydFclqzVuCU_ntrpW4h8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110995%252F4f9364f7-535d-4413-ac4f-a1dcdc3cc1f8.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=xOS5ZNtoQfdvLpNaz1jOzmLUQoQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110995%252F4f9364f7-535d-4413-ac4f-a1dcdc3cc1f8.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=mRimxdKAeukvLq7Xcp2Guy2s66k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share. This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth.  It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals. &#x2063&#x2063&#x2063 &#x2063&#x2063&#x2063 I’m committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer. Earth is the one thing we all have in common — let’s protect it, together.&#x2063&#x2063&#x2063 &#x2063&#x2063&#x2063 - Jeff A post shared by  Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos) on Feb 17, 2020 at 10:00am PST\nUnsurprisingly, he doesn't share many specifics about the Bezos Earth Fund. His Instagram post says it \"will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.\"\nWe've reached out to Amazon for further comment.\nBezos' decision follows a recent protest by Amazon employees in which hundreds of workers added their name to a petition calling on the company to do more to fight climate change.\nSEE ALSO: You just lived through the warmest January on record\nThat action followed another climate change protest in September. That, in turn, led to at least three employees being threatened with discipline (including termination of their jobs) by Amazon, which said it was just following company policy. \nOn Monday, following Bezos' announcement, the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice group issued a statement asking, \"When is Amazon going to stop helping oil & gas companies ravage Earth with still more oil and gas wells?\"\nWithout the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (@AMZNforClimate), Bezos's $10 billion climate pledge today is simply unimaginable. They've just released a statement: pic.twitter.com/jk8JH27UzP— Brian Merchant (@bcmerchant) February 17, 2020\n\nAmazon, as well as other tech companies, have recently come under fire for working with oil companies to maximize the rate at which they extract fossil fuels. \nAdditionally, the Amazon employees group said, \"What this shows is that employees speaking out works - we need more of that right now.\"\nLast September, Amazon made a Climate Pledge \"to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early.\"\nIt's unclear what association the new fund will have with Amazon. \nUPDATE: Feb. 17, 2020, 3:19 p.m. ET Updated to included a statement from the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice group"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1208139%252F4244395d-0ef1-4beb-8725-ed7568760809.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Bn9nr-A2yCJiiDAryz-zmcIFbsI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=av7owFak_c8XdEvDDvM_XYe3atk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.png%252F356x205.png?signature=TkAIVCqvUcUJm9IoAgZwvBVdbzM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.png%252F712x410.png?signature=CArxIooETuHnA9q-LZU500CAPXA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.png%252F280x157.png?signature=USniC1mSx5-F5HQ9prXcC20Sb5M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.png%252F560x314.png?signature=RutH4J5z6vzxrSez41EII00_-xo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Jeff Bezos commits $10 billion to fight climate change","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.png%252F356x205.png?signature=TkAIVCqvUcUJm9IoAgZwvBVdbzM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=RojgrIIdAnDy74OdY6b-1glnmQ8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=BSDBO-DZzVG9KijXAvmG9vyjXfs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.png%252F280x157.png?signature=USniC1mSx5-F5HQ9prXcC20Sb5M=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110857%252F00c376b5-1075-47a7-891e-d496e82491ed.png%252F356x205.png?signature=TkAIVCqvUcUJm9IoAgZwvBVdbzM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Jeff Bezos commits $10 billion to fight climate change","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Bezos puts his money where his mouth is.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Jeff Bezos commits $10 billion to fight climate change"}]
