        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles recorded its first case of coronavirus five weeks before New York City, yet it’s New York that is now the U.S. epicenter of the disease.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Public health officials are keeping a wary eye and warning that LA could end up being as hard hit as New York in coming weeks, in part because a planned increase in testing may uncover a dramatic surge in cases. Testing in Los Angeles County is expected to increase from 500 per day to 5,000 by the end of the week.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“I would love to be able to say with all certainty that’s where we’re not going,” Los Angeles Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said when asked about New York’s numbers. “We would be foolish not to prepare for a similar scenario here in LA County.”</p>

        </div>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">In both cities, schools have been canceled, many businesses shuttered and employees who can have been ordered to work from home. New York City, with roughly 8.5 million residents, had nearly 45,000 cases and at least 366 deaths as of Friday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Los Angeles County, which contains its namesake city of 4 million people plus an additional 6 million residents, had nearly 1,500 cases and 26 deaths.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Health experts don’t know why there is such a big difference in the number of cases, but believe several things could be at play, such as urban density, differences in the use of mass transportation and slightly earlier moves by authorities to enact social distancing policies. A difference in the speed and amount of tests could also be factors, as officials warn that many people who get COVID-19 don’t necessarily have symptoms. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The virus is spread in tiny droplets from coughs and sneezes. Most people who get it experience mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For others, in particular older adults or people with other large health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">While a shortage of tests in California during the early weeks of the crisis is one reason for a much lower number of cases, it doesn’t alone explain the difference. New York has tested about three times as many patients, but it has 10 times as many cases as all of California. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced New York’s first case March 1. The first person reported in Los Angeles, California’s second case, was announced Jan. 26. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">To date, there have been 519 deaths in New York state, more than six times the 85 in California. </p>

        </div>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“The death rate from COVID-19 in California is doubling every three days, which is lower than the New York death rate of doubling every two days,” said Dr. Jennifer Prah Ruger, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania medical school. “It is hard to know with certainty the exact causal mechanisms at this stage in the epidemic.” </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Factors that could explain the differences in the outbreak between New York City and LA speak to the differences in the way people live on opposite coasts.</p>

        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">In New York, residents live in large multi-unit buildings, many with small elevators and tight hallways. City sidewalks are choked with walkers and commuters who flow in and out of the city’s robust subway system. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“New York City is a more densely packed community than what we see in California, even in Los Angeles, which is much more spread out,” said Robert Kim-Farley, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. “The mixing, if you will, of population is much greater there.”</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Still, Kim-Farley warned that with a simultaneous rise in cases and testing, “we’re going to start seeing just tremendous increases,” in the next two weeks in LA. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Indeed, on Thursday confirmed cases in LA jumped 50%, which health officials attributed to the availability of kits. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“This represents a huge jump, my friends: an increase of more than 50% in a single day of confirmed cases,” said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. “Even more disturbingly, we see that if this rate of increase continues (in the county), in six days we will be where New York is today, the same number of cases per capita as they are struggling through.”</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">New York’s public transportation system carries 8 million passengers a day, about eight times the ridership on Los Angeles public transit. Commuters in Los Angeles are far more likely to travel alone by car on one of the many freeways that crisscross a county 10 times the size of New York City.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Professor James Moore II, director of the transportation engineering department at the University of Southern California, said he stopped riding the light rail to campus as the outbreak started spreading. He bought a parking permit and began to drive, a social distancing luxury not everyone can afford, particularly in New York City where car ownership is scarcer.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“It stands to reason ... if you pack small areas and you’re dealing with a disease that is more contagious than the flu but less contagious than the measles, somewhere in there you’re probably going to come away with a lot of cases,” Moore said. “The fact that we rely fairly heavily on automobiles in Southern California and California in general is sort of a lucky break in the crisis for us.” </p>

        </div>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Another element that could have slowed the spread in California was earlier action to force social distancing.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">On March 19, Garcetti, LA’s mayor, shut down schools, restaurants and ordered all but essential employees to work from home and Gov. Gavin Newsom issued the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home directive that evening. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo followed suit the next day.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">It will take time to tell whether those measures were effective because of the virus’s two-week incubation period. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“We can hope it was social distancing that has limited the cases in California, but there are just too many factors that play into spread of the virus to be sure,” said Dr. Catherine Troisi, an epidemiologist at University of Texas, Houston. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“If we were to go on lockdown where nobody saw anybody else for 28 days — two times the incubation period — we are pretty sure we can stop the spread of the virus,” she said. “But, that’s not very reasonable, economically or socially.”</p>

Los Angeles County, which contains its namesake city of 4 million people plus an additional 6 million residents, had nearly 1,500 cases and 26 deaths.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health experts don't know why there is such a big difference in the number of cases, but believe several things could be at play, such as urban density, differences in the use of mass transportation and slightly earlier moves by authorities to enact social distancing policies. A difference in the speed and amount of tests could also be factors, as officials warn that many people who get COVID-19 don't necessarily have symptoms. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The virus is spread in tiny droplets from coughs and sneezes. Most people who get it experience mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For others, in particular older adults or people with other large health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While a shortage of tests in California during the early weeks of the crisis is one reason for a much lower number of cases, it doesn't alone explain the difference. New York has tested about three times as many patients, but it has 10 times as many cases as all of California. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced New York's first case March 1. The first person reported in Los Angeles, California's second case, was announced Jan. 26. \u003c/p>\u003cp>To date, there have been 519 deaths in New York state, more than six times the 85 in California. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The death rate from COVID-19 in California is doubling every three days, which is lower than the New York death rate of doubling every two days,” said Dr. Jennifer Prah Ruger, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania medical school. “It is hard to know with certainty the exact causal mechanisms at this stage in the epidemic.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Factors that could explain the differences in the outbreak between New York City and LA speak to the differences in the way people live on opposite coasts.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"d0ead650-6ae0-11ea-ada0-cf25117f1e1c\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In New York, residents live in large multi-unit buildings, many with small elevators and tight hallways. City sidewalks are choked with walkers and commuters who flow in and out of the city's robust subway system. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“New York City is a more densely packed community than what we see in California, even in Los Angeles, which is much more spread out,\" said Robert Kim-Farley, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. \"The mixing, if you will, of population is much greater there.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, Kim-Farley warned that with a simultaneous rise in cases and testing, “we’re going to start seeing just tremendous increases,” in the next two weeks in LA. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Indeed, on Thursday confirmed cases in LA jumped 50%, which health officials attributed to the availability of kits. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This represents a huge jump, my friends: an increase of more than 50% in a single day of confirmed cases,\" said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. \"Even more disturbingly, we see that if this rate of increase continues (in the county), in six days we will be where New York is today, the same number of cases per capita as they are struggling through.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>New York's public transportation system carries 8 million passengers a day, about eight times the ridership on Los Angeles public transit. Commuters in Los Angeles are far more likely to travel alone by car on one of the many freeways that crisscross a county 10 times the size of New York City.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Professor James Moore II, director of the transportation engineering department at the University of Southern California, said he stopped riding the light rail to campus as the outbreak started spreading. He bought a parking permit and began to drive, a social distancing luxury not everyone can afford, particularly in New York City where car ownership is scarcer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It stands to reason ... if you pack small areas and you’re dealing with a disease that is more contagious than the flu but less contagious than the measles, somewhere in there you’re probably going to come away with a lot of cases,\" Moore said. “The fact that we rely fairly heavily on automobiles in Southern California and California in general is sort of a lucky break in the crisis for us.\" \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8694331514\">Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak\u003c/div>\u003cp>Another element that could have slowed the spread in California was earlier action to force social distancing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On March 19, Garcetti, LA's mayor, shut down schools, restaurants and ordered all but essential employees to work from home and Gov. Gavin Newsom issued the nation's first statewide stay-at-home directive that evening. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo followed suit the next day.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It will take time to tell whether those measures were effective because of the virus's two-week incubation period. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We can hope it was social distancing that has limited the cases in California, but there are just too many factors that play into spread of the virus to be sure,” said Dr. Catherine Troisi, an epidemiologist at University of Texas, Houston. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“If we were to go on lockdown where nobody saw anybody else for 28 days — two times the incubation period — we are pretty sure we can stop the spread of the virus,\" she said. “But, that’s not very reasonable, economically or socially.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press reporter Martha Mendoza in Santa Cruz, California, contributed to this story.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Virus Outbreak-LA vs NY","headline":"Coronavirus cases hit 2 largest US cities differently","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:013ee46b9b97297ed8feef64168d210e","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"013ee46b9b97297ed8feef64168d210e_1a16aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"ents, had just over 1,200 cases and 21 deaths.\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"revision":null,"mediumIds":["55f33ccebbb1474490ee2b4acaf7c939","a4cd3ca6918d43b5ba4446e2b928e0e7","490b9186fa234e8ca57e6878ef15ffb3","58d2c90c1b73486692a9865782a8bb65","408bdfb81a044ef484443a7db60633a3","cad776029c6b4e4a825fd47d3c729051","45eacce2d7e2442dadd1c35f508cdad1","0258150d1db9474986ea3ed887f44ba0","a00a0a8d872f493cb37ca6c6f95295e7"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/55f33ccebbb1474490ee2b4acaf7c939/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"FILE - In this March 20, 2020, file photo, extremely light traffic moves along the 110 Harbor Freeway toward downtown during mid-afternoon in Los Angeles.

One parent, for example, has refused to turn over a child to the other in accordance with their agreement, citing the virus crisis, even though the other parent is taking every precaution. Police have refused to enforce the custody order and recommended the parent go to court, but it's unclear if judges will deem the case an emergency. In another case Kouzi is aware of involving a separated couple, one parent is allowing their kids to go see friends, “to be the fun parent, so the kids will want to stay there full-time instead of with the parent actually following recommendations and guidelines.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's not all grim. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Some parents have actually risen to the occasion and are communicating better than normal, rearranging schedules and increasing FaceTime access and doing what makes sense” for their kids, she says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kouzi, who practices in both New York and in Westchester County, one of its suburbs, is telling her clients to try to use the time productively or to consider mediation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“There will be such a backlog when courts open up again,” she says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some couples are experiencing only minor ripples, if any. Stephanie Pfeiffer, a business systems analyst in Boston, found herself annoyed with her husband when they went food shopping last week, and each time she put something into the cart — two pounds of butter, cans of tuna or tomato soup, a box of crackers — he questioned why.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We're arguing over groceries,” said Pfeiffer. “He accuses me of panicking and hoarding, but the reality is we NEED more groceries.” After all, the couple is now working at home together.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a minor adjustment, Pfeiffer recently moved her makeshift work station away from the kitchen table, where her husband works, into a corner of the dining room. “Now we cannot see each other,” she quips. “As time stretches out, I'm optimistic we will get into a routine and settle in.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some stay-at-home mothers say their husbands, now homebound, are finally seeing how much domestic work their spouses do. In New Jersey, Caren Tolleth, mother of a 5-year-old and a 9-month-old, finds that her workload has only increased with the addition of her husband to the routine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It's been like most days,” she reported last week, “except that my husband is leaving dirty dishes and I get to clean up after him, too.” She joked that her spouse had made the mistake of coming down at one point to chat, “and I handed him a baby to put down for a nap.

Her brother, a pediatric intensive care physician, has to come home through a side door to discard dirty clothing and wash his hands to avoid infecting the family. His wife, a nurse, must be extremely careful as well.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hellman, a social worker and stay-at-home mom, says it's natural that couples with children are feeling intense stress. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Children create stress in a marriage, period,” she says. “The relationship changes dramatically.” Under current conditions, she says, “you're stuck at home all day with each other when perhaps there already were issues.\" She imagines that single parents have it even worse, especially if they have only one child. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“They get no break, they have no one else to be with,” she says. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lewis, the family therapist, says it's still early days. She hopes the couples she treats will find a way to deal with the anxiety and uncertainty in a useful way. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some of her best advice to couples: \"Let's try not to both have a bad day at the same time,” she says. “If today's your bad day, mine is tomorrow.
