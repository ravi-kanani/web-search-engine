    <h2>The Secret to Achieving More While Doing Less</h2> 
    <p> If you’re exhausted at the end of each day, feeling unsure of what you actually achieved in your day, it’s not your fault. The old model of productivity has failed you. Productivity is not about getting more done at a faster speed. It’s about getting results. </p> 
    <p> As high achievers, we measure our work by outcomes, not activity. Checking off more tasks won’t matter unless they’re the right tasks. </p> 
    <p> To address this, I’ve created an entirely new system for productivity that will drive results instead of endless box-checking. After all, true productivity is a means to a greater end—the achievement of what matters most at work and at home. </p> 
    <p> What I’m about to show you will clear a path for you to achieve more by actually doing less. </p> 
    <p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>The results look like this:</strong> </p>

    <h2>What If You Could Eliminate Distractions and Realize Your Full Potential at Work and at Home?</h2> 
    <p> Even if you do want true productivity, it can seem like the world is working against you. </p> 
    <p> </p>
    <ul class="checkmark-list"> 
     <li>Because you’re responsible, you attract more tasks that eat at your margin.</li> 
     <li>Distractions are everywhere. From our phones to our co-workers, getting actual work done can seem impossible.</li> 
     <li>And the “urgent” often disrupts your plans for productivity.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p></p> 
    <p> Throughout it all, you desire an energized, satisfying, effective life. You want to be proactive, not reactive. You want the power to finish, delegate, and delete so that you can live and work in peace. In your mind’s eye, you can see yourself at peak productivity, but that reality is just out of reach. </p> 
    <p> My friend, Free to Focus™ was designed for YOU. </p>

    <p> If anyone knows how it feels to face non-stop emails, constant interruptions, and an endless set of tasks—with the pressure to constantly drive results—I sure do. </p> 
    <p> If you’ve faced personal and professional chaos because of your to-do list, I hear you. </p> 
    <p> As a father of five daughters, I have been the CEO of a major corporation and am now a successful entrepreneur leading a fast-growing company. If you want to talk about raising a family, running a business, managing employees, satisfying shareholders, following your dreams, AND having time for rest and relationships, you have come to the right place. </p> 
    <p> First, I need to share an important truth with you: <em><strong>There will always be more tasks than time.</strong></em> </p> 
    <p> As I spent years pursuing the answer to making my own life productive and fulfilling, I realized that the solution isn’t magically getting it all done or finding more hours in the day. </p> 
    <p> You and I only have 24 hours a day, and that’s it. </p> 
    <p> But how you make use of those 24 hours is the difference between feeling swallowed alive and feeling like the task-eating shark on top of the food chain. </p> 
    <p> You must learn to make the maximum use of your hours with the kind of focus that only few know how to harness. </p> 
    <p> And I’m going to show you how. </p>

    <h3>Module 1: Stop in Your Tracks</h3> 
    <p> The first thing we need to do is STOP. This is a radical departure from everything you’ve ever been told about productivity. Conventional wisdom says you need to move faster and push harder to achieve more, but that is 180-degrees backwards. We have to get clear on what we’re after, what is and isn’t working, and get a vision for what’s possible before we turn our attention to greater efficiency. Otherwise, we’ll just propel ourselves faster in the wrong direction. </p> 
   </div>

   <div class="wrap"> 
    <h3>Module 2: Cut Almost Everything</h3> 
    <p> The next step will help you cut through the jungle of too many to-dos so you can clearly see your path to what matters most. Tasks take energy, and when we attempt too much, it depletes us, leaving us exhausted, less effective, and burdened by unfinished work and unmet expectations. </p> 
    <p> In Module 2, I’ll show you how to eliminate 80% of what’s on your to-do list that should never have made it on there to begin with. Then I’m going to supply you with three tools for chipping, chiseling, and sanding your schedule into a masterpiece. When we’re done, you’ll be free to finish your most important tasks and projects and leave everything else behind. This will give you the dramatic freedom to spend more time with your family and get to the goals you’ve been putting off. </p>

   <div class="wrap"> 
    <h3>Module 3: Act in Your Desire Zone</h3> 
    <p> This is where everything comes together. Once you have gotten clarity on your priorities, addressed any necessary changes to your routine, and eliminated, automated, or delegated all that you can, Module 3 will teach you how to activate your new lifestyle. You’ll arrange your time blocks, manage your energy, and consolidate the tasks that remain. As you begin to execute on the plan you’ve established, you’ll also build momentum that will sustain you for the long-term and scale to however your career or business grows. </p>

    <p> Right now, if you’re like most entrepreneurs and leaders, you’re probably spending 20% of your time on high-leverage, revenue-producing projects. The other 80% is spent on inefficient meetings, solving other people’s problems, a sea of email, draining operational issues, and the countless fires you have to put out. </p> 
    <p> But what if you could flip that—and spend 80% of your time on the projects that drive your business forward instead of just keeping it going? </p> 
    <p> That would mean a 300% increase in your ability to focus on the projects and priorities that generate cash now and in the future. You could… </p>

     </ul>

    <p> If your business received 300% more of your best thinking and creativity, that would double or even triple your revenue. Your personal income could grow by 50%—or much more. </p> 
    <p> Right now your business is running on 20% of your best efforts… but it doesn’t have to be that way. </p> 
    <p> Imagine what it would feel like to finally have the FREEDOM to focus on the most important priorities in your business every day instead of every once in a while. Free to Focus is the accelerator that drives your business and revenue forward exponentially. </p>

         Free to Focus has changed my life. After 35 years it’s realigned me, it’s reset me, I’m more present in everything I do. Before Free to Focus my life was completely out of balance. Free to Focus has transformed me not only in my business but in my personal life. Spending 90% of my time in my desire zone has really freed me. My energy has been reborn again. I’m doing a better job of empowering my team.

         After completing Free to Focus I was in a substantially better place to really deliver results in our business. I was able to enjoy more vacation time in a 12 month period than I ever have. Free to Focus allowed me to stay free to be fully engaged and present in a much smaller number of tasks. Having that framework was instrumental in really achieving the results in this last year.

         Last year, through implementing the Free to Focus principles, I’ve had the capacity to learn more about how to take care of myself and have the capacity to execute on actually taking care of myself. I’ve been taking care of myself so well that now I don’t need an insulin pump anymore. It means a ton for my future health which then will lead to more memories, greater experiences with my little girls and my wife.

         Free to Focus has enabled me to pick out my most important tasks, and get those accomplished, and leave me enough margin to do things that I think are making a difference in the world around me.

Everything has opened up to me—deeper relationships, more meaningful interactions with acquaintances, a deeper intimacy with my husband.

    <h2>If You’ve Read This Far, What Are You Waiting For?</h2> 
    <p> If you’re like many of my students, you’ve tried a lot of other productivity systems before. You’ve bought books and read countless articles hoping to finally improve your workflow and reduce the amount of distractions you face. But somehow, despite what your best efforts, the strategies you’ve sought to adopt just haven’t lived up to the hype. </p> 
    <p> The truth is, we live in a world that doesn’t value the things we value. Nothing is sacred to a cell phone. When you’re expected to constantly be available, or you’re pressured to stay after 5 p.m. so you’ll be seen as “really committed,” your true priorities get the last of your attention. But here’s the good news: <em>You don’t have to live this way</em>. </p> 
    <p> It’s time to say good-bye to that self-defeating lifestyle—the one where your family, friends, and passion projects finish last. (Even your business suffers under this faulty model!) Free to Focus is the system that will bring clarity to the areas where interruptions and demands are clouding your view. Better yet, it will amplify your ability to make your greatest contributions, both in the office and at home. You will actually get <em><strong>the freedom to focus</strong></em>—on everything that’s important to you. </p> 
    <p> So don’t spend another moment stressed, stuck, or overwhelmed. Become Free to Focus today. </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <h3>If I’m already productive, will this course be helpful to me?</h3> <p class="answer"> Absolutely yes. This course was designed to benefit high achievers, no matter where they are in their productivity journey. <br><br> Most people who would significantly benefit from this course are those who would already consider themselves decently productive. The truth is, the productivity system we use for one stage of our lives, careers, or businesses don’t always scale to get us to a higher tier. The more work you accomplish, the more work you’ll receive. Since you’re already effective, you’re a responsibility magnet—and Free to Focus is the solution you need to manage life at that transformational level where you know how to zero in on the most important things regardless of the amount of requests you receive or the level of responsibility you attain. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>How is Free to Focus different from the book, <em>Free to Focus</em>?</h3> <p class="answer"> Think of <em>Free to Focus</em>, the book, as a college class textbook. How many of you would just buy the textbook and not go through the class? You might be successful, but you often need the class to take action on the material. Otherwise, the material is just information. <br><br> Buying <em>Free to Focus</em> is like reading the textbook. Joining the Free to Focus course is like going through the class.<br><br> The course allows you to implement the material in a way you couldn’t do on your own. The course workbook alone has templates and exercises the book doesn’t include. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>How is Free to Focus™ different from <em>Getting Things Done</em> (GTD)?</h3> <p class="answer"> As you probably know, GTD stands for <em>Getting Things Done</em>. It is a popular productivity methodology created by David Allen. We are often asked how <strong>Free to Focus™</strong> differs from it.<br><br> First, GTD does work for some people. No question about it. However, in a survey we conducted last year of people who had read the book and attempted to implement it, only 25% felt the system worked for them.<br><br> When we asked them why, they typically provided one or more of the following three reasons: First, GTD doesn’t provide a mechanism for filtering your lists. If you think of a task, you automatically put it on a list. Before long, you end up with scores of lists and hundreds of tasks. Second, they spent way too much time managing the system. Rather than actually getting things done, they were constantly reviewing their lists and trying to figure out what to do next. Because this can be so overwhelming, they ended up careening from one urgent item to the next. They also reported that they spent an inordinate amount of time searching for the perfect software tool to help them get things done.<br><br> We still contend that there is nothing wrong with GTD per se; it’s just missing some key elements that <strong>Free to Focus™</strong> provides:<br><br> 1. The Freedom Compass™ provides the missing filter. You don't have to ingest everything into your system. Tasks outside of your Desire Zone should be automatically challenged.<br><br> 2. The Cut framework—Elimination, Automation, and Delegation—provides a process for dramatically reducing the number of tasks you have to manage. No one operates 100% in their Desire Zone, but the more you can, the fewer tasks you have to manage.<br><br> 3. The Big 3 makes for a very simple system that is easy to manage and keeps you focused throughout the day. As a result, you don’t just get more done, you get the <strong>right</strong> things done. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>Do I have to use technology or adopt a new calendar or to-do list system in order to benefit from this course?</h3> <p class="answer"> Not at all. We believe that any productivity system should conform to the way YOU choose to work, not the other way around. To implement the strategies in <strong>Free to Focus™</strong>, you don’t have to confine yourself to any particular calendar or to-do list method. We’ll emphasize what’s already effective for you and help you refine those methods. You're free to use only analog (pen and paper) solutions, only technology, or a combination of both. If you want to use technology, I’ll show you what programs and apps been helpful for me and how to use them. But even in our lesson on Automation, using technology is totally optional! </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>How will this course help me grow my business or build my career?</h3> <p class="answer"> Let’s be honest: Most leaders spend <strong>80%</strong> of their workdays attending to the urgent, putting out fires, handling interruptions and email, and otherwise solving issues that do not affect the bottom line. That leaves only <strong>20%</strong> of their workdays for high-leverage projects and priorities, such as forming new client relationships, developing new products, expanding into new markets, and more. <strong>Free to Focus™</strong> allows you to flip the 80/20 ratio so that you are spending 80% of your workday on <strong><em>the things that matter most to the growth of your company and your career</em></strong>. That means a <strong>300% increase</strong> in results for you.<br><br> Some who have already taken <strong>Free to Focus™</strong> are seeing <strong>30-40%+ increases</strong> in company revenue growth and personal compensation. Others are seeing a return of 10-20 hours per week in their schedules that they can use to prioritize the people and projects that are most important. Especially for those of you who are concerned about the price point or feel that you are too busy already to take the course, rest assured that you will see your investment multiply! </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>How is Free to Focus different from <em>5 Days to Your Best Year Ever</em> and <em>Full Focus Planner</em></h3> <p class="answer"> Imagine looking at your year from 15,000 feet, then from 5,000 feet, then at ground level. The <strong>5 Days to Your Best Year Ever</strong> course is the 15,000 foot view, which helps you plan your annual goals and live your year with intention.<br><br> <strong>Free to Focus™</strong> is the 5,000 foot view. It’ll help you FINALLY make progress on the big goals you’ve casted for the year. It focuses on your day-to-day productivity, deconstructing and rebuilding your daily work processes and helping you prioritize what matters: task by task, hour by hour.<br><br> The <strong>Full Focus Planner</strong> is your ground level view. It helps you design your days and achieve your goals with this new understanding of productivity in mind. With all three working in unison, you can almost guarantee you’ll make progress on your most important projects and goals this year. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>Can Free to Focus™ help me stay focused on the important priorities and goals I’ve already identified?</h3> <p class="answer"> For some people who are seasoned leaders, your priorities may already be clear, but that doesn’t mean your path to pursuing them is. Even if you know exactly where you should be spending your time, I bet you find it difficult to stay focused or spend as much time in your Desire Zone as you’d like (or your business needs). (If you’re not familiar with the Desire Zone, it’s explained further in the course as the place where your passions and proficiency meet.) In Free to Focus™ Modules 2 and 3, Michael will show you exactly how to clear the path -- and how to organize your weeks and days so your most important priorities take their rightful place on the top of your list. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>Will I Receive Anything in the Mail?</h3> <p class="answer"> The Free to Focus™ course is 100% digital, so you will receive everything online. Your instant access to all the material begins when you set up your account after purchase. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>What Happens After I Purchase Free to Focus?</h3> <p class="answer"> We’ll send you a confirmation email with details about how to set up your account. Once you do so, you’ll be able to log into the course and start as soon as you’re ready. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>Why Should I Buy Now?</h3> <p class="answer"> Here are 3 reasons to buy now:<br><br> 1. I’ve sunsetted the Free to Focus online course. This is the only time you could buy it at this low price.<br><br> 2. It turns the principles of the book into actionable steps. You can leverage the tools and templates inside the course to take immediate action on Free to Focus.<br><br> 3. This is a limited time opportunity. Because I want you to take action on what you learned as fast as possible, I’m ending this deal after Thursday, April 18th at 11:59pm Pacific. Then the price will jump back up $200. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>What if This Doesn’t Work for Me?</h3> <p class="answer"> If Free to Focus is not satisfactory for you, let us know within the first 30 days, and we’ll give you a full refund. We want you to feel confident about your purchase. Don’t worry—we believe that you’ll get a lot of value out of this course. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>How Do I Get a Refund?</h3> <p class="answer"> Email our team at <a href="mailto:support@freetofocus.com">support@freetofocus.com</a>, and we’ll address your refund within one or two business days, if not immediately. Our team is very responsive and would love to help you. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>How Long Will I have Access to this Course?</h3> <p class="answer"> You have lifetime access after purchasing the course. You do not have to renew at any point. </p> </li> 
     <li> <h3>What if I Have More Questions?</h3> <p class="answer"> Contact our customer support team at <a href="mailto:support@freetofocus.com">support@freetofocus.com</a>. They will gladly assist you and answer any further questions you may have. </p> </li>
