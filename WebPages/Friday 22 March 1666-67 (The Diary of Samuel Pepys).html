        <h1> Friday 22 March 1666/67 </h1> 
        <p>Up and by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke</a> about business for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> about money, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/848/">Sir Stephen Fox</a> to give him account of a little service I have done him about money coming to him from our office, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8522/">Lovett’s</a> and saw a few baubling things of their doing which are very pretty, but the quality of the people, living only by shifts, do not please me, that it makes me I do no more care for them, nor shall have more acquaintance with them after I have got my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemayne’s</a> picture home. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> at Chapel, and I would not stay, but to Westminster to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6514/">Howlett’s</a>, and there, he being not well, I sent for a quart of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">claret</a> and burnt it and drank, and had a ‘basado’ or three or four of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8177/">Sarah</a>, whom ‘je trouve ici’, and so by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8584/">Sir Robt. Viner’s</a> about my accounts with him, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the ‘Change</a>, where I hear for certain that we are going on with our treaty of peace, and that we are to treat at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10869/">Bredah</a>. But this our condescension people do think will undo us, and I do much fear it. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> having dressed herself in a silly dress of a blue petticoat uppermost, and a white satin waistcoat and whitehood, though I think she did it because her gown is gone to the tailor’s, did, together with my being hungry, which always makes me peevish, make me angry, but when my belly was full were friends again, and dined and then by water down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2673/">Greenwich</a> and thence walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a>, all the way reading <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/332/">Playford’s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10969/">“Introduction to Musique,”</a> wherein are some things very pretty. At Woolwich I did much business, taking an account of the state of the ships there under hand, thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1814/">Blackwall</a>, and did the like for two ships we have repairing there, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> and did the like there, and so home. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10970/">Captain Perriman</a> with me from Deptford, telling me many particulars how the King’s business is ill ordered, and indeed so they are, God knows! So home and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where did business, and so home to my chamber, and then to supper and to bed. Landing at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a> to-night I met on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1395/">Tower Hill</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> and spent half an hour walking in the dusk of the evening with him, talking of the sorrowful condition we are in, that we must be ruined if the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> do not come and chastize us, that we are resolved to make a peace whatever it cost, that the King is disobliging the Parliament in this interval all that may be, yet his money is gone and he must have more, and they likely not to give it, without a great deal of do. God knows what the issue of it will be. But the considering that the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, instead of being at sea as Admirall, is now going from port to port, as he is at this day at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a>, and was the other day with the King at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8834/">Sheernesse</a>, and hath ordered at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a> how fortifications shall be made to oppose the enemy, in case of invasion, [which] is to us a sad consideration, and as shameful to the nation, especially after so many proud vaunts as we have made against the Dutch, and all from the folly of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, who made nothing of beating them, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/110/">Sir John Lawson</a> he always declared that we never did fail to beat them with lesser numbers than theirs, which did so prevail with the King as to throw us into this war.</p>

         <p>shift, n.<br>any of these senses belong also to MHG., MLG. schicht(e, mod.G. schicht division of property, stratum, layer, one of several sets of persons or things, period of working time (in mining), one of several successive parties of miners working together for a fixed period of hours. It seems probable that the Ger. word is identical with the Eng. and Scandinavian words, the substitution of (xt) for (ft) being found in other words introduced into standard German from LG. (cf. e.g. G. sacht = Eng. soft).] </p>

         <p>"Forever changing..." Exactly.These are artists, I presume, and it's just interesting that Pepys should suddenly be so adamant "that it makes me I do no more care for them."His notions of quality have changed.But then it's off to "a ‘basado’ or three or four of Sarah" and a quart of wine.This is a low contrast moment, but it's actually quite in character.His standards of taste have long been evolving.His habits have not so much. </p>

         <p>"living only by shifts"</p> 
         <p>Does this expression make any other British reader of the diary think fleetingly of Del-Boy Trotter of "Only Fools and Horses" and his attitude to business? (I don't know where else in the world this TV series may be shown, so apologise to readers who haven't seen it).</p> 
         <p>I have the impression that Sam is dissatisfied with the Lovetts' approach to their trade - do a bit of this, try a bit of that, but exhibit no serious, planned approach to running a professional business. Useful from time to time, but not solid, dependable (and hence worthy) tradespeople.</p>

         <p>Low blood sugar! Peevish! Tell me about it! For some of us "hunger", or rather the need to eat, is indicated by the intensity of that ratty feeling and not anything else. Confirmation is provided by the sudden ability to voraciously eat in contrast to the preceding lack of interest in food. Some mothers know of this and wisely inform their new daughters in law; they may however neglect to tell the mere male involved.</p> 
         <p>Our Sam shows a much more integrated awareness of his 'inner man' as some used to say. He seems to be constantly foraging, making strategic arrangements for the future supply of large cuts of meat, etc, for parties and feasting as well as opportunistically acquiring oysters, pasties, and the like as he passes on his way. </p> 
         <p>I think this "peevish" comment of Sam's shows his degree of almost hyper activity to be more likely a general feature of metabolism, perhaps a relatively high level of thyroid activity, rather than a form of ADD or the like.</p>

         <p>What's the relationship between river pilots and trumpeters? Trumpets were used like flags at sea, to convey orders from the admirals and captains, so employing a trumpeter as an able seaman makes sense. A river pilot guides large ships up a river to a dock which requires special local knowledge; if they have gone on strike for lack of pay (or gone over to the Dutch), that's a potential disaster.</p>
