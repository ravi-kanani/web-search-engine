You've known her forever. You hear her talk about her interests on a daily basis. You're not in that weird unofficial zone where neither partner knows how hard to go for this lovey-dovey holiday.\nBut finding something to showcase how much she means to you is more of an enigma than it seems. TV commercials are no help outside of diamond infinity symbol necklaces and gift guides ~for her~ list things you could get for your wife, or sister, or mom. How do you nail romance without being too cliché or too vague?\nIf you're overthinking it, we scoured the internet to find gifts with the perfect combinations of thoughtful and practical. A Kindle may not look romantic to anyone else, but when your wife realizes that you've noticed how she's struggling with lugging books around, she may just melt.

Avoid the hiccups and “umms” that come with finding the right words – say it with flowers instead.\nDuring the 19th century, Victorians used bouquets like a secret code, each flower representing a different meaning. Rosemary was for remembrance, basil for hatred, and tulip for fame. Flower dictionaries were made to help recipients decode these fragrant messages, kind of like obsessing over a text from your FWB. \nHere are a few of our favorite smelly sentiments:\n\nRed roses: Basic but classy\nYou’ve reached that stage in your relationship where you’re down to walk the dog together wearing sweatpants, eat microwave pizza, and drink boxed wine. Being that comfortable with another human is one of the best things ever — and totally deserves a dozen red roses.\n\nImpress your crush with this sweet arrangement\nYou share a creative vision for your joint social media account and a stream of adorable “us-ies.\" This vase has all the flattering angles, and the stylish hues make it pretty enough to squeeze into that Valentine's Day breakfast usie.\n\nRainbow roses: Definitely not basic and still pretty classy\nWith a swirl of bright colors, the Time to Celebrate rainbow rose bouquet is perfect for the person you have the most fun with. Whether it’s shaking your booties on the dance floor or standing by them through four nights of Phish concerts, love is love.\n\nA multifunctional bouquet \nLet your bestie know you appreciate her holding it down like an absolute boss on the work front — and still making time for you to get mani-pedis on Galentine’s Day. Freshly picked blooms, including stems of calming lavender, are a modern flower power move. \n\nThe kawaii factor is off the charts with heart-shaped succulents \nA cutesy pot of Hoya Hearts for your cutie. This low-maintenance plant needs minimal TLC and fits snug on a desk, bedside table, or kitchen windowsill to remind someone you’re in touch with your emojis.\n\nIf you feel lucky to be in love, this fresh bamboo plant is for you\nJust moved in together? Lucky bamboo is a popular feng shui element that brings peaceful vitality to your home (two stalks also represent love and marriage). With decorative stones and an angular wood vase, this plant adds a natural design element to your shared space."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1184287%252F2d990073-b0cb-4138-9bcc-74ae7b45abd7.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=Zi-c4dd8awICOdUM1YLn_0Lg1UY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110221%252Fd1b851b5-7033-41df-ac23-59f22076e8b9.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=KA4t_9eaM68yGhBm6ZmyWUYGzME=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110221%252Fd1b851b5-7033-41df-ac23-59f22076e8b9.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=RIEPbinDhTk7_bd2R-saJ5wPhcs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110221%252Fd1b851b5-7033-41df-ac23-59f22076e8b9.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=_S9Ox1VfYdc-i225_VtHot3IcGM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Say \"ILY\" IRL with 25% off FTD’s best-selling bouquets","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110221%252Fd1b851b5-7033-41df-ac23-59f22076e8b9.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=RIEPbinDhTk7_bd2R-saJ5wPhcs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110221%252Fd1b851b5-7033-41df-ac23-59f22076e8b9.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=yCkYNMsw11aOcyjviZ45QAv4kLE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110221%252Fd1b851b5-7033-41df-ac23-59f22076e8b9.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=RIEPbinDhTk7_bd2R-saJ5wPhcs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Say \"ILY\" IRL with 25% off FTD’s best-selling bouquets","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Avoid the hiccups and “umms” that come with finding the right words – say it with flowers instead.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Say ILY IRL with 25% off FTD’s best-selling bouquets"},{"_id":"5e398e3d28cc361d5a000020","id":"/gifts/best-last-minute-valentines-day-gifts/","title":"Waited until the last minute again?

If you’re the proud owner of a shiny new iPhone 11 or Samsung Galaxy S10 and are geeking out on the ultra wide-angle lenses, or if you’re still shooting salad pics on your tired-but-trusty Google Pixel 2, you probably have more than a few priceless photos of your friends, your travels, and of course, strangers’ adorable dogs. \n\nWhat are you going to do with all those photos? Make them into last-minute gifts, we say! We’re big suckers for personalized paraphernalia, AKA the things that nobody really needs but we want anyways because they have our very own photos on them.

But I didn't understand the true importance of hardcore environmentalism until I watched A Plastic Ocean on Netflix in 2018. That night, as I immediately purchased reusable water bottles for myself and my family members, the way I think about shopping drastically changed.\nFeeling guilty about maniacal holiday shopping is a growing sentiment. We all get giddy when we find the perfect gift for someone, but consumerism really puts a damper on holiday cheer when you think about how much packaging will be thrown out, how many old tech items will be tossed to make room for new stuff, or how many underpaid workers are putting in extra hours to get you that extra-cheap outfit on Black Friday.\nLuckily, there are many eco-friendly gifts that let you reduce your carbon footprint while still lighting up a loved one's face. (We're talking sustainable clothing that has won the hearts of Instagram's \"it girls\" and comforters made from recycled bottles.) Buying products made from materials already in circulation or replacing items we use every day with a reusable version can make a big difference.\n\nAs the climate crisis becomes harder to ignore, we all have a similar thought: What can I do to help? Though ceasing plane travel and becoming a zero-waste household would be the ultimate solutions, they just aren't feasible for the average person. However, gifts that have a positive impact on the environment offer a tangible way to get involved.\nSEE ALSO: Here’s what to do if flying makes you feel guilty\nIt's true that pollution from big corporations is the larger problem, but regular folks making it a point to reduce and reuse can still have a hugely significant impact. The singe-use plastic that we toss after 12 seconds will either sit in a landfill and release methane for hundreds of years before it decomposes or join the 8 million metric tons of plastic dumped in the ocean every year that have deadly effects on marine life. Just think about what we could do if millions of people around the world became more mindful of their consumption. If nothing else, that pack of reusable straws could be the gift that sparks your friend's interest in the bigger sustainability movement.\nHere's what to shop for at every price point.\nEco-friendly gifts under $20\nStocking stuffers don't suck when they're not socks or batteries. Small items like biodegradable toothbrushes, dishwasher-safe sandwich bags, and body wash in recycled bottles are things they'll use every day anyway, but now they can reduce their plastic waste while they're at it.\n\nBest eco-friendly gifts under $50\nUpping the price point expands gift possibilities to things that can be tailored to a specific person's interests. Your outdoorsy friend will use the shit out a solar-powered charger, and your mom will love to flex these gorgeous, vegan soaps in her bathroom.\n\nEco-friendly gifts under $100\nHere's where the gifts get so nice, the person won't even realize their gift was chosen specifically because it has a positive environmental impact. Teenage girls who care about skincare will love a sonic pulse face brush for its exfoliation benefits, but you'll love it because it nixes the need for those non-biodegradable makeup wipes.\n\nEco-friendly gifts under $200\nMore and more brands are making recycled materials a crucial part of their production process without letting style or aesthetics slip. A new comforter, winter coat, or luggage were probably things that someone on your list wants anyway — now get them with an ethical twist.\n\nEco-friendly gifts that are over $200 and really nice\nThe best splurges are the ones that you don't have to feel guilty about. Perhaps the person on your list asked for new clothes or a new tablet. Buying a refurbished iPad or purchasing sweaters from a sustainable, Instagram-famous brand gets them the big gift they wanted while giving you peace of mind."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1073934%252Ff051b038-e122-4630-9094-2d61aaf7f27f.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Ll3SiiHP-l7Uql46NyvRSsvRGMA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104254%252F78f7a780-47d0-470b-b8ca-3e616fb6484b.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=XuoAnKwqAL0U_PwcTCYewz-fics=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104254%252F78f7a780-47d0-470b-b8ca-3e616fb6484b.png%252F356x205.png?signature=SMdDjH8HFvIOZeEnYMzqqWfrILQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104254%252F78f7a780-47d0-470b-b8ca-3e616fb6484b.png%252F712x410.png?signature=qy0rTFG3c8s7pOYd-SiRk7ZVkK4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104254%252F78f7a780-47d0-470b-b8ca-3e616fb6484b.png%252F280x157.png?signature=vo3xJbLe-nLr3GOuH_UsD6EFFPI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104254%252F78f7a780-47d0-470b-b8ca-3e616fb6484b.png%252F560x314.png?signature=heIGyP8Z5igxHUVYQan2eEva_2E=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Eco-friendly gifts at every price point","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104254%252F78f7a780-47d0-470b-b8ca-3e616fb6484b.png%252F356x205.png?signature=SMdDjH8HFvIOZeEnYMzqqWfrILQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104254%252F78f7a780-47d0-470b-b8ca-3e616fb6484b.png%252F280x157.png?signature=vo3xJbLe-nLr3GOuH_UsD6EFFPI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104254%252F78f7a780-47d0-470b-b8ca-3e616fb6484b.png%252F356x205.png?signature=SMdDjH8HFvIOZeEnYMzqqWfrILQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Eco-friendly gifts at every price point","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Do your part for the planet by gifting responsibly this year.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Eco-friendly gifts at every price point"},{"_id":"5dd2cfe92463a31512000014","id":"/article/fun-cat-gifts-ideas/","title":"10 gifts that your rude cat may or may not ignore","title_tag":null,"author":"Morgan Sung","post_date":"2019-11-18T17:07:50+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 17:07:50 +0000","formatted_date":"11/18/2019","sort_key":"1IwRoZ","link":"https://mashable.com/article/fun-cat-gifts-ideas/","content":{"plain":"We can all agree that regardless of how cute they may be, cats are real assholes. \nIt's just evolution — they're predators who domesticated themselves, and they'll just never be man's best friend. No matter how much love you shower on them, they may or may not return the affection. They're notorious for being ungrateful gift receivers — if you grace them with a new toy, they'll probably ignore it for weeks before showing any interest. \nAs the holiday season approaches, here are 10 gifts you can get your beloved fur baby. They may or may not appreciate it. \n1. A grass planter \n\nMaybe keeping fresh grass for your cat to gnaw on will prevent them from chewing your phone chargers. Maybe. \nPlus, who doesn't love a good houseplant? \nPrice: $9.95 at Chewy\n\n2. A fresh water fountain \n\nYour cat probably hates stale water as much as you do — and if they're curious, will probably resort to whatever they can find in human cups or worse, in the toilet. Nip it in the bud with a fresh water fountain. \nPrice: $26.99 on Amazon\n\n3. A comfortable bed \n\nOK, these beds are technically marketed to dogs. But your cats will probably love Casper's pet bed line, too — they're luxuriously soft. \nPrice: Casper pet beds start at $125.\n\n4. A self grooming toy \n\nIf you're not home often and your cat is starved for some sweet, sweet brushing, get them a self grooming toy. It'll get all the good spots and even includes a fun hanging toy for them to swat at. \nPrice: $10.99 from Chewy\n\n5. A fancy scratcher \n\nTired of the 10-pound demon in your house shredding up your couch? Maybe it's time to give them a vertical scratcher to focus on instead. \nPrice: Wall scratchers start at $64.95 at ModernishShop on Etsy.\n\n6. An automatic laser toy \n\nKeep your cat entertained for hours with an automatic laser toy. It appeals to their natural hunting instinct and will keep them in active. We love to see it!\nPrice: $21.99 on Amazon\n\n7. Tasty snacks\n\nAccording to Reviews, Tundra's freeze-dried cat treats are one of the healthiest cat treat option on the market. With pure protein and a variety of flavors, your cat won't get any nasty fillers. \nPrice: $8.99 on Amazon\n\n8. Some catnip joints\n\nThe \"Meowijuana Catnibas\" joints will give your cat a lit night in. The pre-roll joints are packed with catnip that'll keep the 'nip contained for an easy clean up. \nPrice: $9.99 from Chewy\n\n9. An elaborate cat tree\n\nNow this is the height of luxury. How far are you willing to go to make your cat happy? Give your prince everything he deserves and more with this palatial perch. Will he actually use it? Who knows. \nPrice: $1,199.00 from PetTreeHouses on Etsy.\n\n10. Literally a cardboard box \n\nIf you don't want to risk your asshole cat ignoring your very expensive purchase, you can always just get him or her a standard box. If they fits, they sits. \nPrice: $0.78 at Home Depot\n\nThese gifts are purr-fect to treat the bane of your existence your sweet fur baby to something nice this holiday season. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1077614%252Feba54603-6f9b-48d1-8116-820269c972f8.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=fV1oPMO0kZMdug-8b-Ua0bNClGM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106286%252Fd2229dac-0a04-40c3-a284-6dfe7ee3383e.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=Us8GTsVlkuoWrhWBb5RXtqMbE7E=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106286%252Fd2229dac-0a04-40c3-a284-6dfe7ee3383e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=cfOQRTDJPDrFf3G8WYsxUl1bmb8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106286%252Fd2229dac-0a04-40c3-a284-6dfe7ee3383e.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=PhgN4-j5O3CTb3cAEen7Ubw_MLI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106286%252Fd2229dac-0a04-40c3-a284-6dfe7ee3383e.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=ckzjdhWK47K2hlZN6bVBsxi-ZX4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106286%252Fd2229dac-0a04-40c3-a284-6dfe7ee3383e.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=CDG3tQO62Xb-B7guoliL8g90UWo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"10 gifts that your rude cat may or may not ignore","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106286%252Fd2229dac-0a04-40c3-a284-6dfe7ee3383e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=cfOQRTDJPDrFf3G8WYsxUl1bmb8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106286%252Fd2229dac-0a04-40c3-a284-6dfe7ee3383e.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=ckzjdhWK47K2hlZN6bVBsxi-ZX4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106286%252Fd2229dac-0a04-40c3-a284-6dfe7ee3383e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=cfOQRTDJPDrFf3G8WYsxUl1bmb8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"10 gifts that your rude cat may or may not ignore","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Cats are jerks and will probably lose interest in whatever nice thing you get them.

Boulangerie candle\n\nAnthropologie is, at times, extremely overpriced and it remains unclear how mere mortals can afford to shop there on a daily basis. But I must admit that sometimes, when I get stressed and am in close proximity to an Anthropologie store, I walk in and smell the candles.\nMany scents are lovely and soothing, but Boulangerie's Espresso scent is my personal fave.

Chrissy Teigen's cookbook\n\nCan you say comfort food? Though I'd hate to admit it, we can't live solely off peanut butter cups.

One of the great exceptions to this rule is the Amazon Kindle e-readers. They’re made to last for weeks on a single charge, and store a huge library of books, so that you can easily travel with your entire collection. Since the first Kindle launched in 2007, they’ve been considered some of the best available e-readers and travel companions. But does the newest member of the Kindle family do enough to hold on this recognition?\nAmazon recently shared with us its brand new Kindle Paperwhite ($130), which is one step above its cheapest Kindle model and one step below its most expensive. It’s the model that’s often marketed as the greatest value for people, giving readers high-end features such as waterproofing, but in a small body and at a fraction of the cost of the bigger Kindle Oasis ($249). The Kindle Paperwhite is built to be the best available e-reader to the most amount of people, and historically this model has been lauded as the one you should buy.\nSo what makes this new Kindle Paperwhite so damn special? In this review, we’ll break down point-by-point what you get with this new Kindle, whether you need to upgrade, and whether this is something that you should consider buying if you don’t already have one. What you’ll find is that Amazon really hit it out of the park with this Kindle, and you’ll will struggle to find a popular holiday gift item that is this good. So with that in mind, let’s jump in starting with the hardware.\n\nAn excellent travel companion\nIt’s hard to imagine the Kindle Paperwhite getting any better than the near-perfect previous version, but this new Paperwhite builds on some of the best attributes of the previous model, and it starts with the body of the device.\nAmazon boasts that the new Kindle Paperwhite is 10 percent thinner, 10 percent lighter, and 10 percent brighter than the previous generation. It’s certainly not enough to justify upgrading from the previous model, but does help Amazon retain its stranglehold on the entire e-reader market. Think of this upgrade like an “S” version of an iPhone. The improvements are iterative and hard to tell at first glance -- but they are significant enough that they ensure the device remains the best available in its class.\nI’ve been a Kindle owner for about eight years now, using two devices in that time, and one of the biggest issues I’ve had with my Kindle Oasis from 2014 is that I don’t like bringing it to the beach. I’ve always been worried about getting sand lodged into the ports or, god forbid, getting water on the device during my previous vacation reading time. \nThe new Paperwhite takes care of this concern through the addition of waterproofing (IPX8 rated). Yes, this means that you can now submerge your Kindle in two meters of water for up to 60 minutes without having to worry about bricking the entire device. We’re not sure why you’d ever want to submerge your Kindle for that long, but at least the option is there.\nThe more practical use case is taking the Kindle Paperwhite to the beach, poolside, or even in the hot tub if you’re feeling really ambitious. Now, you can find the most comfortable setting to read in -- even if that means being sprawled out on an inflatable swan in your backyard swimming pool. \n\nWait, it does more?\nI’ve always felt that the extra features on an e-reader are a bit of a gimmick, since the whole point of the device is single-purpose use. In my mind, a good e-reader should be really good at one thing: displaying words on a page for a very long time. Anything beyond that is typically unnecessary and ends up draining the battery faster -- defeating the purpose of an otherwise useful machine.\nThe Kindle Paperwhite does a great job of packing in lots of extra features that making reading easier and more fun. It starts with the personalized reading settings. Now, you can save font sizes, boldness, and orientation settings as a profile, and you can quickly switch between different users from the home screen. Amazon has also added family libraries, which makes it easier for people to access books from an account of a spouse or partner. Inevitably, these features are totally unnecessary, but make it much easier for multiple people to share a device and enjoy the books they love.\nAnother unexpectedly good addition is the Kindle’s integration with Audible, one of the largest suppliers of audiobooks. What’s impressive is that you can access the Audible store directly from the Kindle home screen, and when you decide to buy an audiobook, you can seamlessly switch between the written and spoken version of the book using Amazon’s proprietary “Whispersync” technology.\nSo, if you’re the type of person that enjoys reading a book part of the time and listening to it during other parts of the day (say in the evening versus your commute), the Kindle makes it ridiculously easy to jump between versions, and pick up exactly from the page you left off on. Admittedly, this was something that I hadn’t been doing before owning the Kindle Paperwhite, but really enjoyed trying during this review. Safe to say that I’m now considering buying an Audible subscription just for this feature.\nThe Kindle Paperwhite also comes with a bluetooth antenna, unlike previous generations, so that you can listen to the spoken version of your audiobook on speakers or wireless headphones if you so please. This was something I didn’t find much use for, but it’s easy to imagine how, say, a younger person might want to take advantage of this feature using headphones. The only catch with using the bluetooth antenna is that it (of course) consumes significantly more battery than the super-efficient e-ink display that comes with the device.\nFinally, the Paperwhite has a front-lit display that makes it easier to read at night, and is the primary reason you’d want to choose this over the cheaper Kindle ($80), which crucially does not have a screen that lights up. I can’t emphasize enough how important this front-lit screen is, especially for people who travel frequently. It’s the main reason I upgraded from my third-generation Kindle a few years ago. Having a device that stays charged for weeks and lights up in dark places is an incredible benefit to have while backpacking, or even spending several hours on an airplane and in airports. Let me say this one more time: You definitely want the front-lit screen.\n\nFinal thoughts\nThe Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is hands-down the best value e-reader you can buy. It’s not quite as big as the Kobo Forma ($280) or Kindle Oasis ($250), but for a large majority of readers that won’t matter. Plus, it’s easier to carry around in this smaller body and costs way less. It’s also packed with high-end features like Audible Whispersync and waterproofing. But if you still can’t reason through buying this device, consider that Amazon is also throwing in a six-month free trial to Kindle Unlimited, which gives you unlimited access to millions of titles and many of their audiobook versions on Audible. If you don’t have an e-reader yet, and want to buy one for yourself or a for a loved one, look no further than the Amazon Paperwhite. \nWATCH: Are Apple's new iPad Pros worth spending big money on? — Mashable Reviews"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F878514%252F02eaa186-c087-4b31-88fb-5640f730f2ce.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=ChdhDU-EZXW3_HImumJFTjg4BNc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F83679%252Fbceba770-d258-4943-936c-05f3d48131ec.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=hwpugguZfWu7iRTOLvnxZCcRVvk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F83679%252Fbceba770-d258-4943-936c-05f3d48131ec.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=VJQUOEGYwIsaBgIc0zuuVavtQNk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F83679%252Fbceba770-d258-4943-936c-05f3d48131ec.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=-WmKb6SZQruv3RhF3F-1ewKlmAo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F83679%252Fbceba770-d258-4943-936c-05f3d48131ec.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=VGAt2B4v-P-j_tAIFjX5kxLQ0xw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F83679%252Fbceba770-d258-4943-936c-05f3d48131ec.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=LR62fBDx1bJiQ2dt5TQNjQNjzK8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-reader for your money","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F83679%252Fbceba770-d258-4943-936c-05f3d48131ec.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=VJQUOEGYwIsaBgIc0zuuVavtQNk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F83679%252Fbceba770-d258-4943-936c-05f3d48131ec.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=VGAt2B4v-P-j_tAIFjX5kxLQ0xw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F83679%252Fbceba770-d258-4943-936c-05f3d48131ec.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=VJQUOEGYwIsaBgIc0zuuVavtQNk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-reader for your money","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"productreview":[{"id":878516,"data-id":878516,"data-template":"default","data-product-url":"https://zdcs.link/918Xq","data-product-price":"129.99","data-product-name":"Amazon Kindle Paperwhite","data-product-good":"Frontlit display,Waterproof up to 2 meters for 60 minutes,Saves different reading profiles,Starts at 8GB of storage,Seamlessly switch between audiobooks and reading","data-product-bad":"Smaller screen than more expensive models,Can't change color of the built-in lights","data-product-blurb":"The Kindle Paperwhite is the best value e-reader available.

(Nothing like seeing your girl’s face light up when she finds out what you got her, amirite?) \nBut the process of figuring out what gift to get can be a tricky one. You want to end up with a gift that shows your girlfriend how much you care. Duh. But there are *so* many factors that go into picking the right gift, which can sometimes get overwhelming. For example, the length of time you’ve been together is definitely going to play a role in what gift you get (you don’t want to go with something too fancy for someone you’ve only been seeing a few weeks, but you’ll probably want to step it up for someone you’ve been seeing for a long time.) There’s also the originality factor. You want to avoid getting her something generic, but you also want to make sure you get her something she actually likes. (Just because she’s a cat person does not mean she wants that cat onesie you saw online. Or maybe she does — in that case, go here.) \nDon't fret. To make your decision process a *whole* lot easier, we've compiled a list of the best gifts for girlfriends that are sure to help you nail the gifting game no matter what. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82888%252F67a72a9d-91ad-4668-b284-2d63172d3add.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=ttrHWWEZ4AqLz2y6kRklblJmiOM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82888%252F67a72a9d-91ad-4668-b284-2d63172d3add.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=EXVKx-qwzOpqVNir4IyNbCf5FUg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82888%252F67a72a9d-91ad-4668-b284-2d63172d3add.png%252F356x205.png?signature=woKoLS1Vl-mewzfNFHCOo2SS9jo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82888%252F67a72a9d-91ad-4668-b284-2d63172d3add.png%252F712x410.png?signature=c_G8hWbq4ba68h49IxTg0T_lMZI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82888%252F67a72a9d-91ad-4668-b284-2d63172d3add.png%252F280x157.png?signature=DY8bwK8HqHMjEByhIpRaRjekamw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82888%252F67a72a9d-91ad-4668-b284-2d63172d3add.png%252F560x314.png?signature=_A8Ygg2-mWzSDMvL0bL4qARYuuk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Best gifts for your girlfriend: Gift ideas for your number one girl","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82888%252F67a72a9d-91ad-4668-b284-2d63172d3add.png%252F356x205.png?signature=woKoLS1Vl-mewzfNFHCOo2SS9jo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82888%252F67a72a9d-91ad-4668-b284-2d63172d3add.png%252F280x157.png?signature=DY8bwK8HqHMjEByhIpRaRjekamw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82888%252F67a72a9d-91ad-4668-b284-2d63172d3add.png%252F356x205.png?signature=woKoLS1Vl-mewzfNFHCOo2SS9jo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Best gifts for your girlfriend: Gift ideas for your number one girl","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Get her something from this list and we promise you'll nail it.
