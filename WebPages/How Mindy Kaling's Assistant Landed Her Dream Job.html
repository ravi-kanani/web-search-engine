       <p><em>In "Deskside Confessionals," Bustle speaks with assistants to the stars, CEOs, and cultural tastemakers. What do today's real-life Andy Sachs do to decompress, juggle projects, and bond with their bosses? First up, Mindy Kaling's can-do sidekick, Elena Dole.</em></p>
       <p>Elena Dole started her new job on April Fools' Day 2019, an apropos beginning for Mindy Kaling’s new assistant. The Hollywood multihyphenate — <a class="PlU" href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a29340748/mindy-kaling-interview-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actor, writer, creator, producer,</a> you name it — was launching production on a new Netflix series, <a class="PlU" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/netflixs-never-have-i-ever-teaser-is-classic-mindy-kaling-22637183"><em>Never Have I Ever</em></a> (April 27). On Day 1, Dole nestled into a crowded writer’s room at NBCUniversal.</p>
       <p>Dole, 24, serves as Kaling’s primary work assistant and is around for anything she needs, from readying a microphone to offering thoughts on an unpublished screenplay. The Los Angeles native first met the comedian when a friend from her alma mater, the University of Southern California, texted: “Do you know someone who could help my boss with some part-time work?” she remembers. “I was like, ‘I’d be interested.’ ” Dole dishes on her famous boss’s pet peeves, her glamorous new office, and their shared penchant for yams.</p>
       <p><strong>Can you tell me about the interview process?</strong></p>
       <p>I went in for an interview with Mindy and <a class="PlU" href="https://twitter.com/mindykaling/status/1112177302916366337?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her [previous] assistant, Akshara</a>. We chatted for 20 to 30 minutes. She mainly just wanted to get to know me as a person, because it’s such a personal job. Experience was second. That was for part-time [employment], and then the need was over. A week later, a writer’s assistant job opened up at one of her TV shows, <a class="PlU" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-new-four-weddings-a-funeral-trailer-teases-mindy-kalings-rom-com-limited-series-video-18159583"><em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em></a>. I interviewed for and got that. Around the time that show was wrapping up, it looked like her assistant was going to be promoted. I stuck around, sent some e-mails, [and] switched into that role.</p>
       <p><strong>Did you have to interview again?</strong></p>
       <p>I did. I heard from Akshara about the quantity of work and range of tasks, to make sure I understood [the] commitment. You’re dedicating a couple years to learn and support Mindy. She’s wonderful. Why would you not?</p>
       <p><strong>Any takeaways from the interview?</strong></p>
       <p>Well, she’s a stickler for good handwriting. I have medium handwriting. She described it as being “age appropriate.” Her previous assistant had beautiful handwriting, so I had big shoes to fill. It's really funny. She was like, “Elena! Your handwriting! That’s enough for today.”</p>
       <p><strong>What are your main responsibilities?</strong></p>
       <p>My role is like the switchboard for every avenue of her life. One day, I’ll be talking with a line producer of the show, while also texting her publicist, e-mailing her social media team, and booking flights for a trip, all while reading a script.</p>
       <p><strong>Do you have a moment from this job you’re most proud of?</strong></p>
       <p>Two other assistants and I put together a wrap party for the whole cast and crew of her Netflix show. We had 315 guests. We worked so hard, and it went off without a hitch.</p>
       <p><strong>What’s your workspace like?</strong></p>
       <p>My office is technically wherever she is. If she has a show in production, we work out of NBCUniversal. When she travels, or if she has a commercial shoot, I'll go with her. We also have an office at Warner Brothers. When she's between shows, we'll work from home.</p>
       <p><strong>Tell me about the Warner Brothers office.</strong></p>
       <p>We had it designed by <a class="PlU" href="https://www.dwell.com/article/serena-and-lily-cofounder-lily-kanters-new-brand-sells-delightful-home-goods-for-under-dollar25-e35d7fe3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serena &amp; Lily</a>, one of Mindy’s favorite design companies. We have a neon sign, very plush carpets. There are couches and fun pillows, and posters from all of her shows. We have a bike. You walk in like, “Can I move in?”</p>
       <p><strong>What's the biggest perk of your job?</strong></p>
       <p>Getting to be around Mindy. She trusts the people around her. If she’s read a script and thinks, “Hmm, I just don’t know,” she'll give it to me. She always asks our opinions. Last week, we were kind of quarantined [but] hadn't done the whole lockdown yet. She made a full brisket from scratch for us.</p>
       <p><strong>What? That sounds amazing.</strong></p>
       <p>We’re really into food. Mindy insists on the writers having a stocked kitchen, treats, and food trucks.<strong> </strong>Swedish Fish are popular. We both really like yams.</p>
       <p><strong>...Yams?</strong></p>
       <p>I know, it’s a very random answer. Just a full yam, and we put toppings on it, like a baked potato. Also, pita chips and hummus. There’s a hummus [stand] at the farmers market, which Mindy sometimes [visits]. She makes delicious banana bread as well.</p>
       <p><strong>What’s the main way you two communicate?</strong></p>
       <p>Minus the coronavirus, it would be in-person communication. Second would be a tie between text and e-mail. I only call her if something’s urgent.</p>
       <p><strong>Does she ever bring </strong><a class="PlU" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/10/magazine/mindy-kaling-late-night-diversity-comedy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>her daughter</strong></a><strong> to the office?</strong></p>
       <p>She loves to include her daughter when she can, whether that’s a visit or FaceTime. You can hear them giggling down the hallway. Right now we’re working mostly from her house, so she’s able to play with her outside. I gave them a parachute, and she really likes it. She likes to play hide-and-seek even though she’s only 2. She's the smartest baby I've ever met.</p>
       <p><strong>What’s something that’s surprised you to learn about Mindy?</strong></p>
       <p>She truly works every single day. I don’t know if people realize she’s not just like [<em>The Mindy Project</em>’s] Mindy Lahiri or [<em>The Office</em>’s] Kelly Kapoor.</p>
       <p><strong>Have you learned anything from her about how to handle tough situations?</strong></p>
       <p>Stick to what you're saying. If you’re delivering tough news, there’s no reason to back off. Women in all [industries] sometimes <a class="PlU" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/sunday-review/women-ceos-glass-ceiling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aren’t taken seriously</a>. People take Mindy seriously. It’s impressive.</p>
       <p><strong>How does she make people take her seriously?</strong></p>
       <p>She has a strong vision for her projects. She sticks to that, because she knows it’ll be good, and knows what she needs to make that happen.</p>
       <p><strong>What career goals do you have?</strong></p>
       <p>I don’t want to be a writer. The network route interests me, being able to work like a consultant on different shows and making budget decisions. We’ll see what life has in store for me.</p>
       <p><strong>Anything else?</strong></p>
       <p>I make a lot of dad jokes, which she thinks are ridiculous. They’re not cool, and she'll be like, “Elena, stop it. Those are so bad, stop it.” She always smiles, so I keep doing them.</p>

First up, Mindy Kaling's can-do sidekick, Elena Dole."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Elena Dole started her new job on April Fools' Day 2019, an apropos beginning for Mindy Kaling’s new assistant. The Hollywood multihyphenate — "],[0,[1],1,"actor, writer, creator, producer,"],[0,[],0," you name it — was launching production on a new Netflix series, "],[0,[2,0],2,"Never Have I Ever"],[0,[],0," (April 27). On Day 1, Dole nestled into a crowded writer’s room at NBCUniversal."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Dole, 24, serves as Kaling’s primary work assistant and is around for anything she needs, from readying a microphone to offering thoughts on an unpublished screenplay. The Los Angeles native first met the comedian when a friend from her alma mater, the University of Southern California, texted: “Do you know someone who could help my boss with some part-time work?” she remembers. “I was like, ‘I’d be interested.’ ” Dole dishes on her famous boss’s pet peeves, her glamorous new office, and their shared penchant for yams."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"Can you tell me about the interview process?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"I went in for an interview with Mindy and "],[0,[4],1,"her [previous] assistant, Akshara"],[0,[],0,". We chatted for 20 to 30 minutes. She mainly just wanted to get to know me as a person, because it’s such a personal job. Experience was second. That was for part-time [employment], and then the need was over. A week later, a writer’s assistant job opened up at one of her TV shows, "],[0,[5,0],2,"Four Weddings and a Funeral"],[0,[],0,". I interviewed for and got that. Around the time that show was wrapping up, it looked like her assistant was going to be promoted. I stuck around, sent some e-mails, [and] switched into that role."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"Did you have to interview again?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"I did. I heard from Akshara about the quantity of work and range of tasks, to make sure I understood [the] commitment. You’re dedicating a couple years to learn and support Mindy. She’s wonderful. Why would you not?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"Any takeaways from the interview?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Well, she’s a stickler for good handwriting. I have medium handwriting. She described it as being “age appropriate.” Her previous assistant had beautiful handwriting, so I had big shoes to fill. It's really funny. She was like, “Elena! Your handwriting! That’s enough for today.”"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"What are your main responsibilities?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"My role is like the switchboard for every avenue of her life. One day, I’ll be talking with a line producer of the show, while also texting her publicist, e-mailing her social media team, and booking flights for a trip, all while reading a script."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"Do you have a moment from this job you’re most proud of?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Two other assistants and I put together a wrap party for the whole cast and crew of her Netflix show. We had 315 guests. We worked so hard, and it went off without a hitch."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"What’s your workspace like?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"My office is technically wherever she is. If she has a show in production, we work out of NBCUniversal. When she travels, or if she has a commercial shoot, I'll go with her. We also have an office at Warner Brothers. When she's between shows, we'll work from home."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"Tell me about the Warner Brothers office."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"We had it designed by "],[0,[6],1,"Serena \u0026 Lily"],[0,[],0,", one of Mindy’s favorite design companies. We have a neon sign, very plush carpets. There are couches and fun pillows, and posters from all of her shows. We have a bike. You walk in like, “Can I move in?”"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"What's the biggest perk of your job?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Getting to be around Mindy. She trusts the people around her. If she’s read a script and thinks, “Hmm, I just don’t know,” she'll give it to me. She always asks our opinions. Last week, we were kind of quarantined [but] hadn't done the whole lockdown yet. She made a full brisket from scratch for us."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"What? That sounds amazing."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"We’re really into food.

We both really like yams."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"...Yams?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"I know, it’s a very random answer. Just a full yam, and we put toppings on it, like a baked potato. Also, pita chips and hummus. There’s a hummus [stand] at the farmers market, which Mindy sometimes [visits]. She makes delicious banana bread as well."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"What’s the main way you two communicate?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Minus the coronavirus, it would be in-person communication. Second would be a tie between text and e-mail.

You can hear them giggling down the hallway. Right now we’re working mostly from her house, so she’s able to play with her outside. I gave them a parachute, and she really likes it. She likes to play hide-and-seek even though she’s only 2. She's the smartest baby I've ever met."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"What’s something that’s surprised you to learn about Mindy?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"She truly works every single day. I don’t know if people realize she’s not just like ["],[0,[0],1,"The Mindy Project"],[0,[],0,"’s] Mindy Lahiri or ["],[0,[0],1,"The Office"],[0,[],0,"’s] Kelly Kapoor."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"Have you learned anything from her about how to handle tough situations?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Stick to what you're saying. If you’re delivering tough news, there’s no reason to back off. Women in all [industries] sometimes "],[0,[8],1,"aren’t taken seriously"],[0,[],0,". People take Mindy seriously. It’s impressive."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"How does she make people take her seriously?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"She has a strong vision for her projects.

The network route interests me, being able to work like a consultant on different shows and making budget decisions. We’ll see what life has in store for me."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[3],1,"Anything else?"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"I make a lot of dad jokes, which she thinks are ridiculous. They’re not cool, and she'll be like, “Elena, stop it.
