        <p>But if all you want to do is make enough money to quit your job and <strong>start a âlifestyleâ business</strong>, you donât need much money at all!</p>
        <p>In fact, depending on what your <a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/the-end-goal-of-your-business/">end goal</a> is, you can start an online store for <strong>less than $6 a month</strong>.</p>
        <p>The other day, a reader who signed up for my <a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/free-guide/" rel="nofollow">free 6 day mini course</a> asked me the following question.</p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>Your free course is pretty extensive and exhausting to read through. Can you give me some kind of idea in one simple sentence how much this would cost me to start up?</p>
         <p>It seems thereâs a lot of money to put into this before you even start earning anything! Frankly, I donât have any money to start this up, thatâs why I need to begin earning the money first!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Unfortunately, not everything can be summed up neatly into a single sentence!</p>

        <p>Dropshipping is by far the <strong>cheapest and easiest way to start selling goods online</strong> which is why it tends to be the business model that most new entrepreneurs gravitate towards.</p>
        <p>Without going into too much depth, dropshipping is when the online business owner sacrifices some amount of profit in order to <strong>avoid having to carry any inventory</strong>.</p>
        <p>When a customer places an order, the shop owner then places an identical order with their vendor and the <strong>vendor ships the product to the end customer</strong>. The amount of profit made is the selling price minus the cost of goods sold and a small dropshipping fee.</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/dropshipping-vs-affiliate-marketing-which-online-business-will-make-you-more-money/">Related: Dropshipping Vs Affiliate Marketing: Which Online Business Will Make You More Money?</a></p>
        <h4>Cost To Start</h4>
        <p>Hereâs the <strong>bare minimum investment</strong> that you need in order to start a dropshipped online store on a <strong>free open source shopping cart platform</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/bluehost.php">Sign up for a webhost</a> â $3.95/month and includes a free domain</li>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/how-to-start-an-online-store-own-your-website-and-sell-online-without-any-technical-knowledge-required/">Install an open source shopping cart</a> â Free</li>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/how-to-accept-credit-cards/">Sign up for an SSL certificate</a> â $1.50/month</li>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/authorize.php">Sign up for a credit card processor</a> â $0/month, 2-3% fee per transaction</li>
         <li>(Optional One Time Cost)Purchase a template for your website â $20-$50</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you tally everything up above, that comes out to <strong>between $5.45 and $76.45</strong>. $5.45 doesnât sound like a whole lot of money does it?</p>
        <p>With a free open source cart, <strong>your monthly costs for a bare bones site will be on the order of $5-6</strong>. This is how my wife and I started out with our online store <a target="_blank" href="http://bumblebeelinens.com">Bumblebee Linens</a>.</p>
        <p>In fact, we are still on the same open source platform as when we started in 2007 except our web hosting bill is higher due to increased traffic!</p>
        <p>However if you are tech averse and donât want to deal with any website setup whatsoever, <strong>you can opt for a fully hosted platform</strong> like <a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/shopify.php">Shopify</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/bigcommerce.php">Big Commerce</a>.</p>
        <p>The main advantage is that theyâll take care of all of the setup for you including payment processing, security etcâ¦</p>
        <p>Hereâs an idea of what it costs to run a <strong>barebones site</strong> on these 2 platforms.</p>
        <ul>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/shopify.php">Shopify</a> â $29/month.</li>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/bigcommerce.php">Big Commerce</a> â $29/month.</li>
         <li>(Optional One Time Cost)Purchase a template for your website â $50-$200</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While dropshipping costs much less to start than the other online store business models, <strong>there are several disadvantages</strong> which I will outline below.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to easily find dropship vendors, consider signing up for a service like <a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/worldwide.php">Worldwide Brands</a>.</em></p>
        <h4>Revenue Velocity</h4>
        <p>For one thing, the revenue velocity of a dropshipped online store is <strong>much lower</strong> compared to a store that purchases inventory up front. After all, not having to worry about inventory or fulfillment costs comes at a price.</p>
        <p>When it comes to dropshipping, <strong>your wholesale price will be higher</strong>. In addition, most dropshippers also <strong>charge a small fee</strong> whenever a dropship order is processed.</p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
         <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8528053863298805" data-ad-slot="3380221474" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins> 
         <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
        </div>
        <p>All of these costs add up and the end result is that your <strong>profit margins will be much smaller</strong>.</p>
        <p>The other thing to consider is that with dropshipping, you are <strong>selling someone elseâs product</strong>. As a result, you will be competing with many other vendors who are are selling the exact same thing.</p>
        <p>Well guess what happens when you have multiple sellers of an identical item? <strong>The price tends to spiral to the bottom</strong>.</p>
        <p>Thanks to marketplaces like Amazon, <strong>the competition is fierce</strong>. And unless MAP(minimum advertised price) pricing is strictly enforced, you will just be another retailer trying to compete on the best bargain.</p>
        <h4>Barriers To Entry</h4>
        <p><strong>In addition, the barriers to entry will be lower</strong>. Because of the low upfront investment involved and the ease of putting up a website, it can be relatively easy for someone else to <strong>copy and replicate your exact same shop</strong>.</p>
        <p>While they still have to discover who your vendors are, sometimes finding out can be as easy as making a purchase from your store and looking at where the package came from.</p>
        <h4>Portability/Scalability</h4>
        <p>But the beauty of running a dropshipped store is that your <strong>business will be truly portable and scalable</strong>. Since you donât have to worry about inventory, <strong>you can run your business from anywhere</strong> thereâs an Internet connection.</p>
        <p>This means that you could be at a coffee shop or in a foreign country and it wouldnât matter.</p>
        <p>Because you donât have to worry about inventory, your business is also <strong>extremely scalable</strong>. With a computer server taking and managing orders, you will only have to hire additional help as your customer support volume rises.</p>

        <p>Starting an online store the traditional way with inventory carries all of the same costs as starting a dropshipped store except that you also need to <strong>set aside money for your initial cost of goods</strong>.</p>
        <p>Depending on what you plan on selling, this could range from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars depending on the <strong>minimum order quantity (MOQ)</strong> that your vendor requires.</p>
        <p>There are many ways to mitigate the risk and be more intelligent about your inventory management which I may discuss in a future article but the bottom line is that <strong>you will have to put out more money upfront</strong> if you want to carry inventory.</p>
        <h4>Cost To Start</h4>
        <p>Once again, here are the costs associated with starting on a <strong>free open source shopping cart platform</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/bluehost.php">Sign up for a webhost</a> â $3.95/month and includes a free domain</li>

         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/how-to-accept-credit-cards/">Sign up for an SSL certificate</a> â $1.50/month</li>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/authorize.php">Sign up for a credit card processor</a> â $0/month, 2-3% fee per transaction</li>
         <li>(Optional One Time Cost)Purchase a template for your website â $20-$50</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are the costs if you go with <strong>a fully hosted platform</strong> like <a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/shopify.php">Shopify</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/bigcommerce.php">Big Commerce</a>.</p>
        <ul>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/shopify.php">Shopify</a> â $29/month.</li>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/bigcommerce.php">Big Commerce</a> â $29/month.</li>
         <li>(Optional One Time Cost)Purchase a template for your website â $50-$200</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In terms of initial inventory, I typically recommend that you be prepared to invest <strong>at least $1000</strong>. But this dollar amount depends on your sourcing strategy.</p>
        <p>If you are using domestic vendors, this can be <strong>as low as $100</strong>. But if you are importing from China, I recommend around $1k.</p>
        <h4>Revenue Velocity</h4>
        <p>The main advantage of carrying inventory over dropshipping is that you will make a <strong>significant amount of money much faster</strong>. As with everything in life, more risk carries more reward which is why my wife and I decided to carry our own inventory when we first started out.</p>
        <p>Despite having to risk more money(about $630), we were able to make over <strong>$100,000 in profit</strong> after only a year of being in business. And unlike dropshipping, the <strong>profit margins are much higher</strong> and you are in more control over your shipping costs and delivery times.</p>
        <h4>Barriers To Entry</h4>
        <p>Carrying your own inventory has other advantages as well. Because you have to secure vendors in order to source your goods and you have to purchase in bulk, <strong>the barriers to entry are much higher than dropshipping</strong>.</p>
        <p>Since you are in control over your shipping and branding, itâs much <strong>harder to copy</strong> your online store idea.</p>
        <p>Not only would they have to copy your website but they would also have to find your vendors (much harder since you are shipping products yourself) and be willing to shell out more money upfront.</p>
        <p>Iâm not saying that it would be impossible to copy your business idea, but in general <strong>itâs much less likely</strong> due to the increased upfront risk involved.</p>
        <h4>Scalability/Portability</h4>
        <p>Of course the downside is that you have to find a place to <strong>store your goods</strong> and you have to take care of <strong>shipping your product</strong>. However there many ways to get around storing physical inventory.</p>
        <p>For example, you can use a <strong>3PL(3rd party logistics firm)</strong>. A 3PL is basically a warehouse that will store and ship your goods for you on your behalf for a small fee.</p>
        <p>In addition, many store owners who sell on both Amazon and their own online store are using <strong>Amazon multi channel fulfillment</strong> to ship orders as well.</p>
        <p>But bottom line when it comes to managing inventory, there are going to be increased headaches as opposed to dropshipping and youâll have to weigh the downsides compared to the increase in profit.</p>
        <p>There are also <strong>cash flow issues</strong> associated with paying for upfront inventory that you need to consider as well. For example, we routinely invest hundreds of thousands of dollars on inventory every year and <strong>donât see the returns until months later</strong>.</p>

         </noscript></p>
        <p>Selling your goods on Amazon is probably the <strong>fastest way to make money</strong> selling physical products online. Compared to starting your own online store, Amazon has an ENORMOUS built in marketplace of customers that are ready to purchase your products immediately.</p>
        <p>In fact when I <a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/selling-on-amazon/">first started selling on Amazon</a>, I just threw up a few products and made $3k in the first month doing practically zero work. Yes. The marketplace is that huge!</p>
        <p>Now there are many different ways to sell on Amazon that are beyond the scope of this post. But bottom line, Amazon is going to charge you a lot of money for the privilege of selling on their platform.</p>
        <h4>Cost To Start</h4>
        <p>Here are the costs to sell on Amazon as a professional seller.</p>
        <ul>
         <li><strong>Amazon Professional Sellers Account</strong> â $39/month. This is required to list your own private label goods online</li>
         <li><strong>Amazon Sellers Fee</strong> â 15% of your revenues</li>
         <li><strong>Amazon FBA Fee</strong> â The cost to have Amazon store and fulfill depends on your product. But as a rough guideline, I would tack on an additional 10-15%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One thing youâll notice is that the <strong>Amazon fees are extremely high</strong>. And if you take into account FBA fees, you could be paying Amazon <strong>25-30%</strong> of your revenues just to sell on their platform.</p>
        <p>As a result, you need to sell <strong>high margin goods</strong>. If you want to sell private label goods, I would be prepared to invest <strong>at least $1000</strong> on initial inventory. You can get by with less, but itâll be a much slower ramp up.</p>
        <h4>Revenue Velocity</h4>
        <p>The main advantage of selling on Amazon is that you will make a <strong>significant amount of money much faster</strong> than any other ecommerce business model.</p>
        <p>They have a large built in audience and especially over the holidays, it seems like whatever you throw up there will sell. In fact, Iâve had several students in my class <strong>make 6 figures in less than a year</strong> on the platform. Here are a few examples.</p>
        <ul>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/student-story-toni-anderson/">Student Story: How Toni Made 100K In A Single Month Selling Jewelry On Amazon</a></li>
         <li><a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/student-story-how-lauren-makes-6-figures-selling-on-amazon/">Student Story: How Lauren Makes 6 Figures Selling On Amazon And Her 2 Prong Approach To Ecommerce</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Barriers To Entry</h4>
        <p>The main downside to selling on Amazon is that <strong>all sales are transparent</strong> to all other sellers.</p>
        <p>For example if you use a tool like <a target="_blank" href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/go/junglescout.php">Jungle Scout</a>, you can find out roughly <strong>how much money a certain product made</strong> in the last 30 days.</p>
        <p>As a result if you sell a popular product on Amazon, itâs only a matter of time until copycats come in and flood the marketplace with similar or identical items.</p>
        <p><strong>Amazon is a cut throat platform</strong> and you have to be constantly on your toes and monitor your listings.</p>
        <p>In addition because you donât own the channel, Amazon could ban you, change the rules or raise the selling fees at any time.</p>
        <p>Here are a few posts that Iâve written on the topic.</p>

        <h4>Scalability/Portability</h4>
        <p>Thanks to FBA, Amazon takes care of storing your goods, shipping them to the end customer and handling returns. As a result, selling on Amazon is <strong>highly scalable</strong>.</p>
        <p>You also end up <strong>spending less on customer support</strong> because Amazon handles the majority of it for you. In fact, the only thing limiting you is your cash flow and your ability to keep Amazonâs warehouses full of goods.</p>
        <p>Once you have your product sourcing flow nailed down, the sky is the limit.</p>
        <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Decisions_Decisions">Decisions, Decisions</span></h2>
        <p>When it comes to starting an online store, thereâs <strong>more to consider</strong> than just how much it costs to start. You also have to consider your end goals and how much you are willing to risk in order make money sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>After running my own online store, selling on Amazon, and helping many others start their own dropshipping stores, I can honestly say that there are <strong>pros and cons to each option</strong>.</p>
        <p>Whatâs important is understanding what you want out of it, your tolerance for risk, and what you want your end game to be especially if your goal is to <strong>improve your lifestyle</strong>.</p>

           <p>I hate to sound bad but this question kind of bugged me. I mean what do you expect, something for nothing? No wait, some people do expect this.</p>
           <p>You have to invest a little bit to get started, thatâs just being realistic. If you donât have money to put into it, get a job, or a second job and quit buying a few âwantsâ and put the money into your business to get it going.</p>
           <p>I wouldnât spend money willy-nilly without any thought of course but with wise spending it wouldnât cost much to get going as this article points out. If youâre not even willing to go this far, then maybe you really donât want to work hard enough to make this happen in the first place.</p>
           <p>On the dropship/stock inventory topic, we have always done both. We started with a very small inventory and have built this up over the years with our own branded products, and we continue to dropship where it works for us.</p>

             <p>Hey Mark<br> These questions sometimes bug me as well but Iâve found that people who are new to starting businesses all tend to have similar fears. And a lot of times, itâs just a matter of providing a little reassurance to nudge them over the edge. Most people have enough money, they just want a sure thing which is never the case.</p>
             <p>BTW, completely agree with your strategy of combining dropshipping with inventory. In a way, it provides the best of both worlds. Stock up on what makes you the most profit and use dropshipping to fill out your shop. THanks for the comment.</p>

               <p>Hi Steve,</p>
               <p>Well youâre a patient and understanding person:) Youâre right though, if we all waited for the full guarantee or sure thing, nothing much would get accomplished. Sometimes you just have to take the leap of faith and see where it leads. Ideally without spending a lot of money to find out.</p>

               <p>Thank you Steve and Mark for addressing this. The viability of mixing drop shipping with branded inventory was my first question after reading this post. I realize Iâll need to make an initial investment, but I plan on selling on my own website and eventually having branded products. One of my main concerns has been the upfront costs of filling out an entire online store.</p>
               <p>Steve do you have any specific advice for mixing drop shipping with inventory or can you point me to any other posts you might have already written dealing with mixing these methods?</p>

           <p>Thanks for sharing your experiences â Iâm in the process of setting up my online business. Some costs Iâm facing werenât addressed in your article â registering my business ($500 + 250 yearly in Illinois), quickbooks accounting software, accountant advising, etc. I guess some of the more legal/dry costs caught me off guard, and I wondered why I donât see them mentioned often when it comes to starting an online business. Did you just start as a sole proprietorship and use free accounting software? Thanks again for sharing!</p>

             <p>Too many people focus too much on the accounting, logo and legalities of a business upfront then after all that effort they find no one wants their product they have no sales and they give up. They wasted too much time and enrgy on the wrong things at he start.</p>
             <p>Your best to start lean &amp; focus your energies on what matters early on ie the market, competitors, potential traffic, marketing etc Set the company up as basic as you can and forget accounting its not an issue until you actually sell something ! You can get the best accounting package in the world but without sales its a waste of money.</p>
             <p>The hardest part of starting an online store is not the legals and accounting its choosing the right products, knowing how to market, knowing how to structure your website for sales, doing social media, writing for your blog if you plan on doing this.These will make or break your business not accounting or legal.</p>

               <p>Oh, Manny, I couldnât agree with you MORE! I fell into the trap Mandy is obviously inâ¦I wanted to make sure I did things RIGHT and that cost me a lot more money and Iâm still not generating revenue.</p>
               <p>I even paid to have my company name trademarked through a fancy-schmancy law firm. Grrr, it makes me crazy to think about it. I did most of the work and found errors they made that cost me additional time and money.</p>

             <p>@Mandy wow, that is really, really high at $500 + $250 yearly. The thing is you have to have at very least a Tax Resale number to even be considered by real dropshippers and suppliers.</p>
             <p>Donât give up, have a read below:</p>
             <p>This is the most important thing you need to deal with a Dropshipper and/or Wholesaler to source your products to sale and that is the Resale Tax ID here:<br> âRegister for applicable business taxes with the Illinois Department of Revenue. All business owners are required to register at tax.illinois.gov/Businesses/register. After registering your business and filling out tax schedules, you will receive a tax ID and a certificate of registration.â â source: <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Set-up-a-Sole-Proprietorship-in-Illinois" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.wikihow.com/Set-up-a-Sole-Proprietorship-in-Illinois</a></p>
             <p>That link is broken an you need to go here: <a href="https://mytax.illinois.gov/_/#2" rel="nofollow ugc">https://mytax.illinois.gov/_/#2</a><br> Click the link to Individuals then Register my business (Form REG-1 for Sole Proprietorship)</p>
             <p>I could not find the cost(s) however which is odd they arenât showing that up front.</p>
             <p>And agreed with the rest to keep costs down to bare minimum even as you make profit.</p>

           <p>I have found that carrying inventory is way more expensive on the back end of my business than using a drop shipper. With inventory, I have shipping expenses that include supplies, time and have to do additional inventory accounting at the end of the year, which also takes time and money. With drop shipping, I donât to worry about shipping costs or supplies. Drop ship fees are expensed on the back end at tax time, making account a lot easier. If something doesnât sell, I just delete that item from my product mix. I am also able to add newer products quicker to my product mix since my money is not tied up in inventory. So for my jewelry and accessory business, drop shipping works very well. The idea is, you have to find drop ship suppliers that you can trust and quality made products.</p>

             <p>thank you so much for your input, Christiane. I think Iâd go with finding a means to drop ship. Iâm in the process of registering a domain for a potential jewelry/accessory website (choosing a name is the hardest I swear). How long was it until you saw any significant or even non-significant revenue from your site?</p>

           <p>I really appreciate this post, Steve! ð As a new mother and college grad, I wanted to stay at home with my daughter, but I still wanted to work. I went to college for fashion marketing and business and honestly, I wanted to go overseas for grad school, study more, and continue my work in the fashion industry as a stylist/fashion show producer, but life took a turn when I got married and had my daughter so I went with what life gave me (and I love it).</p>
           <p>I currently work as an buyer for an online buying company which is really nice since I can work from home and stay with my daughter, but recently, Iâve gotten an brilliant idea to include what Iâve learned from school and from my CEO into creating my own online company. Essentially, since people know me as a person that can point you into the right direction of finding affordable fashion finds, I wanted to create a platform doing just that. I started a fashion blog for mothers, but I wanted something more straight to the point while still helping people so I went the affiliate marketing route.</p>
           <p>Iâve been comparing templates and Iâve already started creating the website, writing everything down and factoring costs. Itâs so true, when you want to start a business you have to invest something. It doesnât have to be thousands of dollars, but if you want something nice that looks like an legit website to come to, you have to invest something. I was able to learn how to create an website online (in my fashion department in college, we werenât taught that surprisingly), but with dedicating time and setting some money from my work at home job aside, I was able to get everything up and going. I started with a free website template first from Wix to get my idea going, then searched, gathered several paid themes together that I really liked, and asked fellow co-workers that are moms which website was appealing to them more (since mothers in general are my target group). I wouldâve stayed with Wix, but they didnât have filtering or sorting options and it was a bit complicated than anticipated. I started my website with around $300, no inventory included (my website uses affiliate marketing though opposed to dropshipping) and also Iâm able to style people virtually and chat with them when they enter the site. Iâve been coming up with tons of ideas and a lady from my job that has owned an retailer business for 20 years has also helped me learn and gather new ideas.</p>
           <p>I agree that some people have money, but donât know where to look or simply want all of the answers given to them without dedicating personal time into their business. Starting a business is hard work, but having several key things down is important. Knowing who your target market is definitely important because you can start something fine, but only a handful of people come to look or buy because the products arenât targeted to them. For me, Iâve been seeing other websites that do what I want to do, search reviews about them, and gather information that I could or shouldnât learn from them so my site is different, but still informational and engaging.</p>
           <p>Woo! lol Iâm done for now and I apologize for the long post, but I wanted to say this is a great article! ð If you work hard and invest some time and money, you can see your dream become an reality. ð Iâm 24 years old and although I have a lot to still learn, I am willing to put in the work to see my dream become successful.</p>

           <p>Hi Steve,</p>
           <p>That is an excellent and helpful article. It gave me a lot of courage to take a step for starting an online store. But there is a question that comes to my mind is that âAre the vendors at (<a href="http://www.worldwidebrands.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.worldwidebrands.com/</a>) are reliable?â or make it more simple âIs Worldwide Brands reliable?â<br> I am a newbie to dropshipping and I would really appreciate your sincere help..<br> Thanks and Regards,<br> Aitzaz</p>

           <p>Hi, Iâve been thinking about starting up an online clothing store for quite some time. Iâve even been to a few careers advice meetings to see if they could put me in touch with someone who would be able to give me some guidance. However they thought it was a joke, I guess itâs due to my young age (19). So my question to you is, how do I find someone who is willing to give me some guidance/ build connections?</p>

           <p>Hello! I was wondering if you ever recomend drop shipping first as you start your online business then if things go great and you learn your numbers and monitor growth and want to make sure success happens then start keeping inventory rather than spend a bunch on inventory up front in case your online store business fails?</p>

           <p>Hello,</p>
           <p>That was a very informative article! Yet, i am still confused.<br> Letâs say that someone starts an e shop that sells design chairs from various manufacturers. Manufacturers and clients are all around the world. And letâs say that dropshipping is not available. How could he organize a delivery chain system where the 3PL company would collect the product from the manufacturer in one part of the world and deliver it to the client in another part of the world? Do 3PL companies actually do that? And if yes, is the cost worth it? If not, what other solutions are there?</p>
           <p>Thank you</p>

             <p>Working for a very large 3PL, I can answer that for you. 3PLs have a network of global warehouses and shippers, so yes, they can route your product to anywhere in the world. In essence, you pay a fee for leveraging their multi-billion dollar global infrastructure. Most also offer e-commerce and various technology solutions to help you optimize business operations (e.g. Cloud services, hosted infrastructure, hardware as a service etc.). Another helpful feature, depending on your product, is that 3PLs are able to manage product returns, product take-back and in some cases, like electronics, repair and refurbishment. It is certainly worth it at some stage, as youâll never be able to replicate their networks and even huge companies, like Walmart or Apple, and yes, even Amazon, still use 3PLs. Whether or not you can afford it depends entirely on your individual financial situation.</p>

           <p>Very informative Steve. Itâs usually fear that prevents a lot of people to follow their passion and create something that will improve their lives. Starting a business should be based on your passion, so you can be motivated to stay the course even when things are bleak. With a lot of tools online today, itâs much easier to setup a business that you can focus on building overtime.</p>

           <p>Hey, Great post.</p>
           <p>Revenue velocity. Most people are too focused on the bottom-line, even before setting up a descend online store they mesmerise about the humongous revenue it could bring. In my opinion owing an eCommerce store of over own will give us immense flexibility, and over time it can e scaled to any extend.<br> Market place models are great, but an inventory mode help generate higher revenue. There are multitude of options that help us kick start our online store. I own my store in Shopnix (<a href="https://shopnix.in/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://shopnix.in/</a>) platform. Spending 20-30% of the total revenue just to own store on Amazon is not a viable option.<br> Thatâs a great point to highlight. With dropshipping most often we will be competing with the same products.</p>
