Hit Snooze is Mashable's deep dive into how we cope with our collective insomnia and the many ways we can achieve a more peaceful slumber.\n\nHave you had a difficult time drifting off to dreamland lately because **gestures vaguely at the world**? Who could blame you. \nEven before the coronavirus pandemic, many of us had a hard time getting to sleep or woke up still tired, despite our best attempt at getting a full eight hours.\nIf you're wondering how to sleep better, the good news is there are ways to optimize your resting life.  You can get better quality rest with less time, and sometimes all the time in the world won't help (or might even hinder) getting good sleep.\n\"When it comes to sleep time, quality matters. Quantity matters too, but quality is what we need for optimization,\" said Shawn Stevenson, the nutrition and wellness expert behind the New York Times bestseller Better Sleep. \nQuantity matters too, but quality is what we need for optimization.\nBut before we even go there, one caveat: Scientists actually kinda still don't know what the hell sleep even is or exactly why we do it. \n\"We believe it's the time when the body replenishes its neurotransmitters that get depleted throughout the day. It’s a time when our brains are doing the housekeeping, getting rid of unnecessary neuronal connections and solidifying new ones that are developing,\" said neurologist Dr. Randall Wright, medical director for brain wellness at Houston Methodist. \nIt may remain a mysterious phenomenon, but the benefits of quality rest are well established and pretty self-evident. When you're not getting enough quality sleep, people most often report a wide range of cognitive difficulties like headaches, memory problems, inability to concentrate, mood issues, and even depression.\nScientists can say definitively that sleep is a depressed state of consciousness that produces cyclical phases of unique brainwave patterns: wakefulness, followed by drowsiness, then light sleep, deeper sleep (also known as low wave sleep), then finally REM (rapid eye movement), which is when we dream.\nSEE ALSO: The best podcasts to fall asleep to, for every type of insomniac\n\"So when we're talking about optimizing our sleep, we're talking about optimizing those brainwaves patterns,\" said Stevenson. \"Optimal sleep is about spending the needed amount of time in each phase of sleep and transitioning in and out of those stages effectively.\"\nThe good news is that, despite the mysteries around sleep science, there are ample studies with evidence for how lifestyles and habits can improve or disrupt those stages. Both Stevenson and Wright have found that a majority of patients who come in with severe sleep issues can see a vast improvement with routine and habit changes.\n\"I'm a big fan of low-hanging fruits. Because people want change, but they don’t want to change that much,\" said Stevenson. \"And you don't have to turn your life upside down to implement changes that get results.\"\nSo here are some of the best sleep hacks to optimize for the best quality rest. Some might require more effort than others, but now more than ever, it's important to put your health first.\nSleep optimization is based on your individual needs and obstacles\nWhen it comes to improving sleep quality, there are very few one-size-fits-all solutions. Even the ones  presented here will vary depending on the unique conditions of your lifestyle, body, and issues.\n\"Before we can answer the question of how to improve your sleep, the first question we need to ask is what's keeping you from sleeping?\" said Wright. General tips work, but to be most effective, \"It's a matter of understanding who you are, recognizing your biggest underlying problems, and then finding solutions.\"\nThree common categories of sleep difficulties Include: 1) Insomnia caused by psychogenic factors like anxiety, stress, a racing mind; 2) Physical pain like chronic neck and back issues; 3) A medical condition called sleep apnea that causes you to stop breathing during sleep, disrupting your cycles.\nIn the sections below, we'll provide tips to help address each of these issues, along with general rules to follow.\n\nHow much sleep is enough?\nYou know that eight-hour minimum you're always hearing about? It's absolutely not that cut and dry. While six to eight hours fits most, the amount of rest you need changes depending on your age, physiology, activities, and physical and mental state.\nIf you're exercising a lot, stressed, or sick, you'll need more. But also, if you're taking steps like the ones below to ensure better quality sleep, you may very well find yourself needing less. And yes, there is a thing as too much sleep, which typically throws off your whole sleep schedule.\nWhat's most important is to listen to your body, and take note of the amount of time you're getting, your sleep habits, and the activities contribute to feeling well-rested or not.\nSticking to a regular sleep schedule can help everyone\nThis one's the most demanding lifestyle change on our list, but it'll also have a big impact on your sleep quality. Basically, our brains love routine and our internal biological clocks follow a circadian rhythm closely tied to the 24-hour cycle in nature. \nFor that reason, you should really try to get to bed at around the same time every night and wake up at about the same time every morning. (Yes, even on weekends.)\nDo your best to sync your sleep with nature's 24-hour cycle because daylight induces wakefulness hormones, while night light (or lack thereof) induces sleep-promoting hormones like melatonin.\n\nI know, this may sound totally counter to your way of life (especially for night owls like myself). But while young students who pull all-nighters have brains that can handle this disruption better, the older we get, the more severe cognitive difficulties can come from messing with a regular sleep schedule.\nIf your job requires a nocturnal schedule, though, try to find ways to mimic that 24-hour light cycle: get blackout curtains for sleeping during the daytime, and maybe even a sunrise alarm clock for waking up at night.\nThe importance of getting the right kind of light throughout the day is very real. Which brings us to the most dreaded of sleep quality facts.\nSeriously, your screens are poison (but there's hope)\nListen, we get it. We're all addicted to our phones, we love watching TV before bed, and starring at a computer screen all hours of the day is basically ubiquitous to modern life. But we regret to confirm that blasting the blue light emitted from these devices into your face after sundown is like poison for quality sleep (not to mention your vision) with the potential for serious repercussions.\nChanging such an embedded behavior is a big ask, though. So try mitigating the damage with these tools and tricks:\n\n  Blue light-blocking or filtering apps for your computer, like f.lux\n  Blue light-blocking or filtering apps for your phone, like Twilight for Android and the Night Shift function on iPhone\n  Be careful with night modes, which might actually be making things worse\n  Blue light filtering glasses (some suggestions here)\n  Instead of relying on falling asleep to the TV or scrolling through social media as a pre-bed ritual, try to listen to a podcast, relaxing music, guided sleep meditation, or read a boring book. Make sure none of these are too interesting. \n\nEasier do's and don'ts\nPhew, OK, the tough ones are pretty much out of the way. So now let's focus on some easier changes and misconceptions:\n\n  Alcohol: Do not believe in the myth of the nightcap. Alcohol before bed might make you sleepy initially but, actually, once you metabolize it two to three hours later, it stimulates arousal in the brain that makes you wake up. You might not even consciously notice waking up, but your body sure will when it feels like hell the next day. \n  Caffeine: As Stevenson said, \"I’m a fan of caffeine. But I also am a fan of a caffeine curfew.\" So keep your morning coffee or afternoon soda. But pay close attention to the time you drink it, because even having caffeine six hours before bed can cause a measurable loss in sleep quality. That's because of its long half-life. Your body on average takes five to eight hours to digest 100-200 milligrams of caffeine. So if you're planning to go to bed by 10 or 11 p.m., that means your caffeine cut off time should be late in the afternoon.\n  Exercise: Physical activity can do wonders for your sleep quality, if you're exercising at the right time. The misconception that late-night workouts help you pass out is totally off-base, since exercise tends to raise your cortisol levels and suppress sleep-inducing melatonin. On the other hand, morning exercisers were found to spend more time in that important low eave deep sleep stage, and also to have more efficient sleep cycles.\n  Temperature: An often overlooked factor to sleep quality is body temperature. Our sleep is so synced with nature that, in the same way temperatures outside drop at night, our body temperature also wants to drop at night. The optimal room temperature for sleep (and this will sound very low) is generally around 62-68 degrees. A few ways to achieve that include: setting a thermostat, turning off the heater, opening a window, not wearing heavy pajamas, getting cooling bedsheets or comforters. Also, maybe even take a warm shower before bed, so when you enter your cooled bedroom your body knows to start releasing those sleep hormones and neurotransmitter enzymes.\n  Environment: Physical conditions like temperature aren't the only way to set the right environment for sleep. Another underrated factor is ensuring you feel safe in your bed, particularly for the anxious insomnia-prone. That can mean many things, like using calming essential oils or having a partner or pet share the bed. Also, try to restrict activities in the bedroom to sleep, relaxation, and sex. You don't want your brain to associate the bedroom with anything negative. If you do end up finding it easier to fall asleep someplace other than in your bedroom, do it: Fall asleep on the couch first (for example), then transition into the bedroom. If you wake up in the middle of the night and again can't sleep, leave the bedroom and do a boring or relaxing activity (read an uninteresting textbook, listen to music, etc), then go back when you get drowsy.\n\nKnow what to invest in to achieve better quality sleep\nThe sleep industry is booming right now, with all sorts of devices, apps, and mattress tech claiming to help you sleep better. According to our experts, some of those might actually be worthwhile investments. But as with all our advice, the main thing is to find what works for your specific needs. \nFor those with chronic neck and back pain, finding a better mattress with the right firmness, topper, or pillow to suit the type of sleeper (side, stomach, back) you are could fix it. Those with more anxiety and stress-related insomnia should instead look into wearables like the Ebb (which aims to keep you in that deep, low wave sleep longer), Dreamlight Sleep Mask, or Muse S smart meditation headband. You may even want to try and weighted blanket. Just do your research, because there's tons of different types best for different purposes. For sleep apnea sufferers, as we've mentioned you should talk to an expert.\nNow apps are a bit trickier. While they can for sure be a budget-conscious alternative to more expensive tech, the mileage varies on their effectiveness. Sleep trackers can provide good basic raw data and at least get you thinking more about quality over quantity. But the raw data (which itself can be flawed) is pretty useless in the common layperson's hands, who can come away with the wrong interpretation. Apps meant to soothe or calm your mind with sound are always worth a shot, though!\nSleep challenges to watch out for during the pandemic.\n\nThis all sounds fine and well under normal circumstances, but some of this advice can feel nearly impossible to follow due to the life-disruptions and stress brought on by the pandemic. \nWhen you're getting bombarded by apocalyptic news alerts and statistics, on top of mortal fear breathing down your neck — well, if you haven't developed at least a little anxious insomnia, you're probably not taking this seriously enough. \nUnfortunately, there is even less of a one-size-fits-all answer for the sleep problems coming out of these new realities. But here are a few unique obstacles that may come up and ways to try and offset them:\n\n  School and work closures will surely throw off your usual sleep routine since we have even less structure in our day-to-day. Do your best to implement curfews (on yourself and the kids) that maintain a healthy sleep schedule. Avoid the temptation to sleep in super late or stay up all night because you can. And for parents, the benefits of morning exercise prior to homeschooling can help get them to bed faster and at the right time (so you can too).\n  The desire to binge-watch comfort content is more than understandable, and also totally OK. It'd be great to turn some of that binge-watching time into physical activity too, though, using it as background noise during at-home workout sessions in the morning (here's a list of free ones).\n  Now more than ever it is imperative to stick to a screentime curfew. That's not just because of the blue light factor. With the onslaught of anxiety-inducing developments, continuing to scroll through social media or the news before bed is almost guaranteed to cause a mental spiral with health consequences that none of us can afford right now.\n  Another new challenge for bedroom screentime is that many of us are now working from home. If at all possible, separate your work-from-home space from the bedroom (though we understand that's a luxury), even if it's just with a divider. Avoid working from your bed, instead electing the couch as a comfy working spot. Both this and the curfew on news and social media will help avoid bringing all those stressors into the bedroom with you.\n\nAbove all, remember to be kind and patient with yourself. Insomniacs — no matter what the reason for their sleeplessness — can get into a cycle of panic because their stress doesn't let them sleep. Then they get more stressed from not being able to sleep. If that's you, make the goal to simply relax and breathe rather than putting pressure on yourself to sleep.\n "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1252511%252Fcec68c5e-6322-484f-b66e-80afd7d85202.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=3eddxDd9MhPiI5u8ZVCVgyG0vy4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=Pjd9TP8ETcCETuWqdelbhz7GIf4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F800x360.jpg?signature=UCQ2ZjN7vofTXx00Ew1KBw7ZjNQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F1600x720.jpg?signature=G7arSMCU5kn8-gAarnXCbKNhryA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Optimize your sleep with these hacks (even during a pandemic)","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F800x360.jpg?signature=UCQ2ZjN7vofTXx00Ew1KBw7ZjNQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.webp%252F800x360.webp?signature=wwr29x6DGnur5duRi3FCJiZQDeg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","naturalWidth":"800","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F800x360.jpg?signature=UCQ2ZjN7vofTXx00Ew1KBw7ZjNQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","sizes":"800w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Optimize your sleep with these hacks (even during a pandemic)","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"We need the health benefits of quality sleep now more than ever.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","sponsored_by":"","sponsored_by_url":"","order_number":"","tweet_text":"Optimize your sleep with these hacks (even during a pandemic)"}

Since the photo messaging app launched its wildly unpopular redesign in 2017, it has lost a good number of followers. But now that it's slowly regaining momentum, it might be a good time for a quick refresher on — or introduction to — all the fun features that live on the platform.\nMaybe you took a hiatus from Snapchat, maybe you're new to the app, or maybe you're just a power user looking to learn a new trick or two. In any case, this guide will show you Snapchat tips, tricks, and secrets to turn your basic Snaps into Snapsterpieces.\n\n9 ways to create snapsterpieces\n1. Draw with secret color palettes\n\nHate on the redesign all you want, but it did make finding secret colors easier. \nPreviously, users had to drag the rainbow slider in a very specific ways to access secret colors. Now, all it takes is a few taps. Tap on the pen tool, and tap the Venn diagram icon under the rainbow slider to access greyscale and pastel sliders, as well as a second version of rainbow slider. \n2. Draw with emoji brushes\n\nYou can draw with emoji the same way you draw with the pen tool. Tap on the heart-eyed emoji under the Venn diagram icon, and you'll find a range of emoji paintbrushes at your disposal.\n3. Make Snapchat stickers\n\nSome shots are sooo good that you want to use them over and over again. So when life gives you a good shot, make stickers. \nTap the scissor icon, and trace the object you want to clone. Snapchat will automatically smooth out the edges for you and save your object as a sticker. Tap the memo icon to access your custom sticker, and place and scale it however you want.\n4. Use grids, focus, and timer\n\nThese three features are simple but helpful. \nGrids will help you stick with the rules of third. \nFocus will blur out everything but faces.\nAnd timer will help you take selfies. \nTo access these tools, all you have to do is hit the small arrow bubble under the flash icon when you enter camera mode.\n5. Attach emoji and stickers to a moving object\n\nThis hidden feature will come in handy if you're making a reveal video or a video with a moving object. \nOnce you record the video, hit the memo icon to access your stickers. Choose one of them, scale it to your desired size, and hold down the sticker — your video should freeze now. Attach the sticker to the moving object, and viola! \nYou can use this trick for text, too!\n6. Make 3D paintings\n\nSnapchat has some pretty cool augmented reality features, and one of them lets you create AR paintings. \nTap the smiley face icon next to the recording button, and then tap the paintbrush icon. \nYou can choose between matte, metallic, rainbow, neon, and iridescent brushes. You get to change the paint color and brush size, too.\n7. Add text effects\n\nWhy use static text when you can make it move? \nTo use Snapchat's AR text feature, tap the smiley face icon, then the \"T\" icon. \nYou can pick from a couple effects — round, spooky, bubble, wavy, layers, and script. This feature will not only animate text, but also add filters to your entire image or video.\n8. Add filters \n\nThere are two ways to add filters on Snapchat. \nThere's the old way — swiping left or right when you take a photo or video — then there's the new way. Tap the smiley face next to the recording button before taking a photo and video, and you'll find an abundance of options under \"browse\" and \"create.\" \nYou can even adjust the intensity and colors of \"create\" filters by tapping either the icon with the three dots or with the Venn diagram.\n9. Attach website to snaps\n\nMaybe you're sending a story to a friend; maybe you're sharing your latest SoundCloud finds. In any case, the link button can come in handy. Once you take a photo or video, you'll see a paperclip icon on the toolbar to your right. Tap on it, paste or type in a URL, and hit \"attach to Snap.\" \nWhoever you're sending your Snap to will now be able to open up the link by swiping up.\n\n4 ways to use Bitmoji and emoji on Snapchat\n1. Snap Map status\n\nYou probably already know how to use Snap Map to keep tab of your friends. But did you know you can update your friends on what you're doing by setting a Snap Map status with Bitmoji? \nTap on your Bitmoji icon on the top left corner of the camera screen, then scroll to the bottom. Pick \"set a status\" under Snap Maps, then hit \"choose a Bitmoji.\" Your friends will now see your Bitmoji in action when they're looking for you on Snap Map.\n2. Bitmoji selfie\n\nYes, you can make your Bitmoji look however you'd like — even the little one on the top left corner of your screen. Tap your Bitmoji icon, then hit the settings button on the top right corner. Go to \"Bitmoji,\" and pick \"choose a selfie.\" There, you can look angry, surprised, sad — and really, whatever else you're feeling like.\n3. Set a default emoji skin tone\n\nNo one actually has Lego yellow skin — so save yourself some time and set your default emoji skin tone to match yours. You can do that under \"manage\" in your settings, in \"emoji skin tone.\"\n4. Get yourself some Bitmoji swag\n\nLove your Bitmoji? You can rep it if you fancy. Snapchat offers custom Bitmoji merch at the Snap Store: stickers, mugs, t-shirts, sweatpants, phone cases. \nTap the Bitmoji on the top left corner of the camera screen, then scroll down to \"shop Bitmoji merch.\" It will take you to a page where you can customize different items. You get to choose different images of your Bitmoji, too.\n\n4 other things you can do with the Snapchat camera \n1. Find a product\n\nImagine this: You're shopping, you see a shirt that you love, but you're thinking you can get a similar one somewhere else for a much cheaper price. Snapchat's product finder will come in handy in that situation. \nTap the smily face on your camera screen, and tap the \"scan\" icon at the bottom. Scroll to the left, and tap the shopping bag icon. Press and hold the screen to scan the item, and boom — Snapchat will show you a list similar products. \nThe catch? It only shows results that are available on Amazon.\n2. Cheat on your math homework (just kidding...?)\n\nMath is hard. Sometimes you'll spend an hour on just one question to no avail. Snapchat's Math Solver is there to help. You'll find it just next to the Product Finder. Hold and press the screen to scan the problem, and Snapchat will show you a result via Photomath. \n(Yes, it works with calculus problems, too.)\n3. Find a song\n\nNot sure what a song is called? Good thing Shazam is built into Snapchat. You can access the Song Finder next to the Product Finder and Math Solver. When you hear a song, just hold the screen, and you have yourself a new song to add to your playlist.\n4. Play games with friends\n\nSnapchat has evolved. The apps isn't just for sending photos and videos anymore, it's for playing game with friends, too. Tap the smiley face on your camera screen and go to \"browse.\" Swipe left, and you can choose from games like tic-tac-toe, pool, \"what's that movie\" and more. \n\n2 ways to keep things on the low\n1. Keep your snaps private\n\nIf you have something to hide on Snapchat, hide them under the \"your eyes only\" feature. \nSwipe up while you're on the camera screen to access the memories tab. Tap the checkmark on the top right corner, and select the photos you want to hide. Tap \"more,\" then \"hide snap (my eyes only)\" at the bottom toolbar to set up a password to enable the feature. \nOnce you have it set up, you'll see a \"hide\" button at the bottom toolbar. You can use it to hide photos from your camera roll outside of Snapchat, too.\n2. Ghost people on Snap map\n\nIf you find it creepy that your friends can see where you are on Snap Map, this feature is for you. You will still see your friends' locations; but they won't be able to see yours.\nTap on the bitmoji icon on the camera screen, then scroll to the bottom, where you see \"Snap Map.\" Click on \"Sharing Location\" and turn on \"Ghost mode.\" You have the option to go off-grid for three hours, 24 hours, or until you choose to disable the feature yourself. You can also choose to share your location with just a select few friends under \"who can see my location.\""},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1238009%252F00e107cb-3ce7-441b-87e2-287190c28f05.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=E8sPvah9jLJR3QHgDCjnHJnXPOM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111046%252F9d23faf9-e0a1-443a-abe2-ef1c71733ca2.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=SemVQ_lTz-nTSAyD7QxELjzFJJA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111046%252F9d23faf9-e0a1-443a-abe2-ef1c71733ca2.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=t7b_rYXMkC5W4ilmlrbdbyxDDlU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111046%252F9d23faf9-e0a1-443a-abe2-ef1c71733ca2.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=F3zXo6UfxE342yBIAggPb_vCRqo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"19 Snapchat tips and tricks for newbies and power users","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111046%252F9d23faf9-e0a1-443a-abe2-ef1c71733ca2.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=t7b_rYXMkC5W4ilmlrbdbyxDDlU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111046%252F9d23faf9-e0a1-443a-abe2-ef1c71733ca2.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=HNEsZSjlYzURFBEwhCydKyKFS4w=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111046%252F9d23faf9-e0a1-443a-abe2-ef1c71733ca2.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=t7b_rYXMkC5W4ilmlrbdbyxDDlU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"19 Snapchat tips and tricks for newbies and power users","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Create your own Snapsterpieces.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"19 Snapchat tips and tricks for newbies and power users"},{"_id":"5e5f7c912463a37673000058","id":"/article/how-to-clean-phone-case-iphone/","title":"How to clean every kind of smartphone case","title_tag":null,"author":"Haidee Chu","post_date":"2020-03-04T10:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 04 Mar 2020 10:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"03/04/2020","sort_key":"1J9sKJ","link":"https://mashable.com/article/how-to-clean-phone-case-iphone/","content":{"plain":"Let's be clear about one thing: Your phone is F-I-L-T-H-Y. It carries 10 times the number of germs a toilet seat does, so don't expect your phone case to be any cleaner. With flu season in full swing and the new coronavirus spreading, it's better to take precautions than to fall prey to sickness. \nSo please, clean your damn phone case already. \nIf you're looking for a basic wipe-down, Apple has a cleaning guide for its cases. But if you need something more robust, we've got you. Here's how you can disinfect that nasty, yellowing case that stares you down every time you look at your phone.\n\nPlastic\n\nPlastic is relatively durable compared to other smartphone case materials, so it will survive tougher and more effective cleaning solutions, like bleach. If you're uncomfortable working with that, though, feel free to use dish soap instead. (For a bleach-free method, follow the instructions for rubber and silicone cases.)\nWhat you need:\n\n  Chlorine bleach\n  Water\n  Sponge, cloth, and/or toothbrush\n  Dishwashing gloves\n\nHow:\n\n  Bleach can irritate your skin and lungs, so put on dishwashing gloves and open your windows for good air ventilation.\n  Mix one tablespoon of bleach for every cup of water you have. That's one part bleach to 16 parts water, if you want to do it in larger quantities. To avoid injuries, be careful not to splash the liquids.\n  Completely soak your case in the solution for 5 to 10 minutes. If your case has a stubborn stain, feel free to soak it a bit longer or until the stain is gone.\n  Give your case a good scrub with a sponge or cloth to get rid of any grime, dirt, or stain. Use a toothbrush to get to hard-to-reach spots.\n  Rinse your case thoroughly to remove the bleach solution. Pat it dry with a (paper) towel and let it air dry for about half an hour before you put it back on your phone.\n\nAftercare: Wipe your case down with a disinfecting wipe weekly and repeat this routine once a month.\n \nRubber and silicone\n\nRubber and silicone are a bit more delicate than plastic, so you'll have to use a milder cleaning solution. But that also means you might not be able to get all the gunk out in one try. In any case, start by using a dish soap solution, and if stains and yellowing persist, try baking soda after.\nWhat you need:\n\n  Dish soap\n  Water\n  Sponge, cloth, and/or toothbrush\n  Baking soda (optional)\n\nHow: \n\n  Add a moderate amount of dish soap to a bowl or a bucket of hot water and mix well. How much soap? Use your best judgement.\n  Submerge a sponge or cloth into the solution and use it to scrub your case. Use a toothbrush to get at every nook and cranny. \n  Optional: If the stains and grime weren't already lifted after the last step, sprinkle some baking soda on top of them and scrub with a wet toothbrush. For big stains, mix one part warm water with three parts baking soda to form a paste. Apply it to the affected areas, let it sit for about 5 minutes, and then scrub.\n  Rinse your case thoroughly until it's free of soap and/or baking soda. Pat it dry with a (paper) towel and let it air dry for about half an hour before you put it back on your phone.\n\nNote: Don't boil your silicone case or stick it in a dishwasher, as you might with silicone cookware. It could shrink the case. \nAftercare: Wipe your case down with a disinfecting wipe weekly and repeat this routine once a month.\n \nWood\n\nLiquid can cause some wood and wood finishes to shrink or expand. But this vinegar solution is generally safe to use on all types of wood and finishes — just be sure not to soak your case in it. \nWhat you need: \n\n  Water\n  Vinegar\n  Dish soap (optional)\n  Spray bottle\n  Cloth\n\nHow:\n\n  Fill a spray bottle with two parts water and one part vinegar, and mix well. Feel free to add a few drops of dish soap to the solution if you feel that the stains on your case call for a cleaner with a bit more strength.\n  Spray the solution onto the case and wipe it down with a damp cloth. Again, be careful to avoid drenching your case in the solution.\n  Wipe it again with a paper towel or dry cloth to remove excess moisture.\n\nAftercare: This solution functions as an all-purpose, everyday wood cleaner. Save whatever you have left of the solution and repeat this routine weekly.\n \nLeather\n\nLeather is the snowflake of all these phone case materials — it's sensitive to oil, dyed materials, makeup, sunlight, heat, and humidity. Once you stain it, there really isn't an ideal way to address it. It's best to use a leather cleaner and follow the instructions there, but this works as a cheaper alternative, too. Just be mindful that the leather might slightly change color with whatever solution you choose to use.\nWhat you need:\n\n  Water\n  Mild hand soap\n  Cloth\n  Leather conditioner or mink oil (optional)\n\nHow:\n\n  Mix warm water and hand soap in a bowl. Use your best judgment to determine the proportions.\n  Never apply the solution directly onto the case since leather is susceptible to water stains. Dip a cloth into the solution and wring it until it's damp. Wipe your case down with the damp cloth. \n  Use a dry cloth or a paper towel to remove excess water.\n  Optional: Use a leather conditioner or mink oil to keep your case in good shape for the future. Follow the instructions on the label.\n\nAftercare: Keep your case out of direct sunlight, heat, humidity, and anything else that can stain it. Repeat this routine once a month — or more frequently if you prioritize cleanliness over preventing leather discoloration. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1232807%252F556faee6-990a-414c-8ee8-7193f2c866d0.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=GczvSGyQEUA1yiPCbLJkhWuXxL0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111460%252F960442c8-564f-461c-9f40-107a2e81538d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=ZpQ1kUmu0uQtpALsbJjDwsFS8GU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111460%252F960442c8-564f-461c-9f40-107a2e81538d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=0wbaPMNoIYuMqTzKjjW06wPkQjY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111460%252F960442c8-564f-461c-9f40-107a2e81538d.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=kPlmkuAL-mLwISiRb0TUIbS1mv8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"How to clean every kind of smartphone case","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111460%252F960442c8-564f-461c-9f40-107a2e81538d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=0wbaPMNoIYuMqTzKjjW06wPkQjY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111460%252F960442c8-564f-461c-9f40-107a2e81538d.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=7ayQPAawt2fiQYhjb12BnCgtOQ0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111460%252F960442c8-564f-461c-9f40-107a2e81538d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=0wbaPMNoIYuMqTzKjjW06wPkQjY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"How to clean every kind of smartphone case","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Your phone case is a wonderland... for germs and bacteria.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"How to clean every kind of smartphone case"},{"_id":"5dd5b5a42463a370c600000c","id":"/video/how-to-use-an-air-fryer/","title":"How to use an air fryer","title_tag":null,"author":"Alex Humphreys","post_date":"2019-11-20T21:52:30+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 21:52:30 +0000","formatted_date":"11/20/2019","sort_key":"1IxJjB","link":"https://mashable.com/video/how-to-use-an-air-fryer/","content":{"plain":"Want to know which air fryer you should get?

So you resort to a third-party app to block them and all's well, right? Actually, no.\nAs it turns out, many popular robocall-blocking apps such as TrapCall and Truecaller don't have your best interests in mind.\nAccording to TechCrunch and Dan Hastings, a security researcher at NCC Group, many top robocall-blocking apps share your phone number with analytics firms and uploading device information such as device type and software version to companies like Facebook without your explicit consent,\nYikes!\nAnd while some these apps released \"fixes\" after getting caught red-handed, the damage is already done. How can you even trust any of them anymore? You could go and read their lengthy privacy policies to see exactly what data they collect, or you can find another way to block and reduce robocalls without using third-party apps. Here's how you can do that.\n1. Register your number on the Do Not Call List\nAccording to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), one of the simplest ways to block robocalls and telemarketers is to register your phone number on the Do Not Call List, which makes it illegal for them to call you.\nIt's not foolproof. I added my phone number to the list over a decade ago and still get calls from telemarketers, but I'm sure I would get way more if I didn't. Do yourself a solid and add your number.\nNote: It takes 31 days for telemarketers to stop calling your number once it's on the Do Not Call List. So be patient.\n2. If you own a Pixel, use Call Screen\n\nOriginally available only on the Pixel 3 and 3XL, Google's handy Call Screen feature now works on all Pixels, including the Pixel and Pixel XL, Pixel 2 and 2XL, Pixel 3 and 3XL, and Pixel 3a and 3a XL.\nWith Call Screen, the Google Assistant answers phone calls on your behalf and transcribes the conversation in real time.\nIn most cases sending a robocall to Call Screen is enough to get them to hang up immediately. Even if the robocall is persistent, at least you can see that it's spam based on the transcription on your screen, and don't pick up the call.\n3. On iOS 13, send them to voicemail\niOS 13 won't be releasing until September, but if you've already got the developer beta or public beta installed on your iPhone, you can send calls from unknown numbers directly to voicemail — perfect for robocalls.\n\nThe setting needs to be switched on in Settings > Phone > Silence Unknown Callers but once you've got it set, your iPhone will only allow calls from phone numbers in your contacts, messages, and mail apps.\n4. Use your carrier's blocking tools\nCheck with your carrier to see if they have any tools that'll let you block robocalls. Some carriers like AT&T have free apps like Call Protect, but because we're trying to avoid robocall-blocking apps, you'll have to turn to other options.\nFor example, Verizon has a \"Call Filter\" feature that costs $2.99 per month per line and provides the following: spam detection, spam filter, report numbers, caller ID, personal spam list, personal block list, risk meter, and spam lookup.\nA free version of Call Filter is available to all postpaid Verizon customers (sorry prepaid people!) and only includes three features: spam detection, spam filter, and report numbers.\nSprint also offers a similar feature to Call Filter called \"Premium Caller ID\" for $2.99 a month; this service only identifies robocalls, but doesn't block them. To do that, you'll need to block them on manually (see below).\nOn T-Mobile, customers can turn on Scam ID and Scam Block. With Scam ID, if a phone number appears fishy, your phone will display \"Scam Likely\" so you know not to pick up. Scam Block lets you block these \"Scam Likely\" calls.\n5. Block their numbers\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. If a robocall manages to get through to you, end the call and block the number ASAP. It's old school, but it ensures the same spam number will never call you again.\nOn iOS, you can tap the little \"i\" icon next to the call in the phone app's \"Recents\" section and then go down to \"Block this caller\".\nSame goes for Samsung phones running the latest One UI. In the \"Recents\" section of the phone app, tap on a number and then the \"i\" icon and then \"Block.\" You'll be asked to confirm the number block and that's it.\nOn Pixel phones, there's a \"Block/report spam\" setting after you tap a phone number within the phone app's \"Recents\" tab.\nThe setting might be located somewhere else on other Android phones, but most phones should have the ability to block phone numbers.\nWATCH: How to stop robocalls and spammers — Clarification Please"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1028775%252F027d78ff-8e03-499a-8fda-6dd7a4071212.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=8ChSHfAhHCdzy77gDi7zhQ7fb38=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=p5AhsKjqvr0zggbwSF9lAj-MPTo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=4Wqq6gzWexXjlTea_EWIZxoo2E4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=1BuTudL8rFGphcF5G1WGQs3B-5g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=2JAKVrdGjZZVMwSK4CRYjUdGryQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=wviRLdaDIls5Iggc_OJpdGhDDOc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Somebody end this madness.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1028775%252F027d78ff-8e03-499a-8fda-6dd7a4071212.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1028775%252F027d78ff-8e03-499a-8fda-6dd7a4071212.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1028775%252F027d78ff-8e03-499a-8fda-6dd7a4071212.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=rRKhKp_mMY7ic7JhDATni4h2Vy8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1028775%252F027d78ff-8e03-499a-8fda-6dd7a4071212.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=o6CZDldtZxbe54zHqmfj-S7xA8g=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Somebody end this madness."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  ambar del-moral / mashable"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"How to block and reduce robocalls without using data-harvesting third-party apps","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"6k01YrLZ0V","data-ytid":"GPJF2Fjyl9I","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Try these five tips instead.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"How to block and reduce robocalls without using data-harvesting third-party apps"},{"_id":"5d4070049111ae04d000001d","id":"/ad/article/how-to-save-money-millenials/","title":"How to save money and eat your avocado toast, too","title_tag":null,"author":"Mashable Brand X and Green Dot","post_date":"2019-07-30T16:27:46+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 16:27:46 +0000","formatted_date":"07/30/2019","sort_key":"1HSuYy","link":"https://mashable.com/ad/article/how-to-save-money-millenials/","content":{"plain":"Despite the fact that the economy is strong, four in 10 Americans don’t have enough savings to cover an unexpected expense of $400. That said, it’s probably no surprise that one-quarter of adults haven’t started saving for retirement yet — how are you supposed to save up money when you can’t afford to get your laptop fixed?\nTurns out you don’t have to be flush with cash or even give up brunch in order to start saving for retirement. The key to smart financial planning is to break it down into small but impactful habits — like sticking to a budget and banking with benefits — that make a big difference in the long run. \nBuild a budget\nPut together a spreadsheet to see where every dime of your hard-earned money goes. Start by listing your total income and then itemize all of your expenses — your daily matcha fix, yoga classes, your monthly subscriptions — get it all in there. \nIf the numbers say you’re spending more money than you bring in, you’re on the path to debt and need to make a change, stat. Even if you’re earning more than you spend, you can still trim your expenses and save even more.\nCut the fat\nWe all spend our money differently, but nixing some of your straggler subscriptions is likely a great place to start trimming. Do you really need all of the streaming services? What about your phone plan — are you really using all that data or could you downgrade to a cheaper plan? After you tighten your belt, monitor your expenses (there are apps for that) to help you stay on track with your leaner budget.\n\nWork your apps\nWhen dissecting your budget, you not only want to look at what you’re spending your money on, you want to look at how you’re spending your money. If you’re a big online and app shopper, there are digital banks that will actually reward you for that.\nGreen Dot Bank has a new Unlimited Cash Back Bank Account that puts practically 3 percent of everything you spend online or on an app right back into your savings account1. All you need to do is open a Green Dot Bank account and use it as the default payment for all of your regular sites and apps. Green Dot will reward you by kicking 3 percent of what you spend back to you.\nFor the super-saver path,  Green Dot’s app features a High Yield Savings Account2 to help grow funds you set aside. In addition to rewarding your online spending, Green Dot will also reward you with a bonus 3 percent of whatever you have in your savings account every year, up to $10,000. \nBasically, you buy what you already buy and earn 3 percent, sock it away in your savings and earn an additional 3 percent, and then watch your savings grow on the Green Dot app. \n\nOpen an IRA \nYou’ve heard it before, but just do it. Putting anything away for retirement, even what you spend on coffee and a bagel, is a great place to start.\nRoth IRAs are among the most popular long-term retirement accounts because of one key feature: Your contributions and interest earnings grow tax-free and, at retirement, withdrawals are 100 percent tax-free. Just putting $2,000 in a Roth IRA could yield sweet long-term benefits over three decades. Roth IRAs are vital for millennials working in the gig economy, but they can also offer more freedom than an employer-sponsored 401(k). \nIf you take the time to know your budget, open bank accounts that reward your spending habits, and contribute even the smallest of sums into a retirement account, you’re on your way to setting yourself up financially for whatever life throws at you.  \nAll of this smart financial stuff said and done — go ahead and order that fat slab of avocado toast. You’ve earned it. \n\n  ____________________________________________\n\n[1] Exclusions apply.

Besides keeping your Mac safe with security patches (always welcome!), Catalina has a couple of standout features that'll make you more productive.\nWe won't highlight them all, but the following three are the big ones.\n1. Sidecar\n\nIf you own an iPad (running the new iPadOS), you can turn that sucker into a second screen for your Mac using Sidecar. Anyone who's ever used Duet Display knows how useful it is to connect an iPad to a MacBook and get a two-display setup.\nSidecar is like Duet Display on steroids. There are two ways to use Sidecar: wired and wireless (Bluetooth and WiFi) and both modes worked extremely well in my tests. I saw virtually no lag when dragging app windows from a 13-inch MacBook Pro to an 12.9-inch iPad Pro or iPad Air (2019). Similarly, mirroring a Mac screen to an iPad was glitch-free.\n\nHands-down, my favorite feature with Sidecar is Apple Pencil support. In addition to using an Apple Pencil for drawing, which essentially turns your iPad into a Wacom drawing tablet, you can also use it to point-and-click your way around iPadOS as if it was a mouse.\nI also appreciate that there's a \"Sidebar\" on the left side with Apple keyboard modifier keys (Command, Option, Control, Shift) and Touch Bar controls (for apps that support it) on the bottom even if your Mac doesn't have a Touch Bar.\nWhether you're a student or video editor who wants a portable secondary screen to extend your MacBook screen or an artist who might use it as a Wacom substitute, Sidecar is low-key the best feature in Catalina in my opinion.\n2. Voice Control\n\nWhile Catalina's new Voice Control feature is considered an accessibility feature for people with disabilities, everyone can use it.\nUnlike Siri, which uses natural language to answer questions, play music, and fetch the weather, Voice Control is a little more mechanical. The feature recognizes specific voice commands, and while you can record your own, there is a learning curve to using Voice Control.\n\nI wasn't able to become as proficient with Voice Control as the person in the video above, but for basic commands like opening apps and navigating to menus, it was nice to be able to do them hands-free.\nWith more time and practice, I think power users will be able to develop a workflow that mixes both keyboard shortcuts and Voice Control. For example, I just said \"double click\" to highlight a word and bring up a toolbar to format text, which was much easier than highlighting it with my trackpad. Ditto for using voice commands for closing and minimizing windows.\n3. iPad apps\n\nIf there's anything the Mac needs more of, it's apps. Rather than force developers to build new apps specifically for macOS, Apple's allowing developers to easily port their iPad apps to Catalina using a new tool called Project Catalyst.\nUsing Catalyst, developers can convert their iPad apps into Mac apps — complete with Mac-like elements such as menu bars, resizable windows, and keyboard shortcuts — without having to recode everything from scratch. Catalyst is going to be great for small developers who don't have the resources to split their time between iOS and Mac.\nIn addition to being great for developers, iPad apps on the Mac will be great for users, too. Many apps like Twitter, Jira Cloud, and Rosetta Stone will include features not possible within a web browser. \nI'm most excited for the new wave of games on Macs with mouse and keyboard support. For example, Gameloft has already committed to bringing one of my favorite iOS games, arcade racer Asphalt 9, to macOS using Catalyst. Does this mean the Mac's finally getting serious about gaming? The Mac won't suddenly kill PCs, but imagine a playable version of Fortnite on your MacBook Pro. Somebody please tell Epic Games to make it happen!\nOverall, iPad apps on the Mac is going to benefit everyone and give macOS the revitalization it needs.\nHow to download and install\nOK, now that you have solid reasons to update to macOS Catalina, here's how to install the public beta.\nStep 1: Make sure your Mac is compatible with macOS Catalina. The following Macs can be upgraded to the new OS:\n\n  MacBook (early 2015 or later)\n  MacBook Air (mid 2012 or later) \n  MacBook Pro (mid 2012 or later)\n  Mac mini (late 2012 or later)\n  iMac (late 2012 or later)\n  iMac Pro (2017)\n  Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later) \n\nIf you're not sure which model your Mac is, click on the  in the upper left corner of your menu bar and then go to \"About This Mac\" to find out.\nStep 2: Back up your Mac. There are many ways to do that. Whether you use macOS' built-in Time Machine feature or manually transfer all your files to external storage, please back up your data. You're dealing with buggy pre-release software so it is possible something might go wrong.\nStep 3: Register for a beta account at beta.apple.com if you haven't previously tested any Apple beta software.\nStep 4: Enroll your Mac here and then click on \"macOS Public Beta Access Utility\" (it's a big blue button).

Hit Snooze is Mashable's deep dive into how we cope with our collective insomnia and the many ways we can achieve a more peaceful slumber.\n\nHave you had a difficult time drifting off to dreamland lately because **gestures vaguely at the world**? Who could blame you. \nEven before the coronavirus pandemic, many of us had a hard time getting to sleep or woke up still tired, despite our best attempt at getting a full eight hours.\nIf you're wondering how to sleep better, the good news is there are ways to optimize your resting life.  You can get better quality rest with less time, and sometimes all the time in the world won't help (or might even hinder) getting good sleep.\n\"When it comes to sleep time, quality matters. Quantity matters too, but quality is what we need for optimization,\" said Shawn Stevenson, the nutrition and wellness expert behind the New York Times bestseller Better Sleep. \nQuantity matters too, but quality is what we need for optimization.\nBut before we even go there, one caveat: Scientists actually kinda still don't know what the hell sleep even is or exactly why we do it. \n\"We believe it's the time when the body replenishes its neurotransmitters that get depleted throughout the day. It’s a time when our brains are doing the housekeeping, getting rid of unnecessary neuronal connections and solidifying new ones that are developing,\" said neurologist Dr. Randall Wright, medical director for brain wellness at Houston Methodist. \nIt may remain a mysterious phenomenon, but the benefits of quality rest are well established and pretty self-evident. When you're not getting enough quality sleep, people most often report a wide range of cognitive difficulties like headaches, memory problems, inability to concentrate, mood issues, and even depression.\nScientists can say definitively that sleep is a depressed state of consciousness that produces cyclical phases of unique brainwave patterns: wakefulness, followed by drowsiness, then light sleep, deeper sleep (also known as low wave sleep), then finally REM (rapid eye movement), which is when we dream.\nSEE ALSO: The best podcasts to fall asleep to, for every type of insomniac\n\"So when we're talking about optimizing our sleep, we're talking about optimizing those brainwaves patterns,\" said Stevenson. \"Optimal sleep is about spending the needed amount of time in each phase of sleep and transitioning in and out of those stages effectively.\"\nThe good news is that, despite the mysteries around sleep science, there are ample studies with evidence for how lifestyles and habits can improve or disrupt those stages. Both Stevenson and Wright have found that a majority of patients who come in with severe sleep issues can see a vast improvement with routine and habit changes.\n\"I'm a big fan of low-hanging fruits. Because people want change, but they don’t want to change that much,\" said Stevenson. \"And you don't have to turn your life upside down to implement changes that get results.\"\nSo here are some of the best sleep hacks to optimize for the best quality rest. Some might require more effort than others, but now more than ever, it's important to put your health first.\nSleep optimization is based on your individual needs and obstacles\nWhen it comes to improving sleep quality, there are very few one-size-fits-all solutions. Even the ones  presented here will vary depending on the unique conditions of your lifestyle, body, and issues.\n\"Before we can answer the question of how to improve your sleep, the first question we need to ask is what's keeping you from sleeping?\" said Wright. General tips work, but to be most effective, \"It's a matter of understanding who you are, recognizing your biggest underlying problems, and then finding solutions.\"\nThree common categories of sleep difficulties Include: 1) Insomnia caused by psychogenic factors like anxiety, stress, a racing mind; 2) Physical pain like chronic neck and back issues; 3) A medical condition called sleep apnea that causes you to stop breathing during sleep, disrupting your cycles.\nIn the sections below, we'll provide tips to help address each of these issues, along with general rules to follow.\n\nHow much sleep is enough?\nYou know that eight-hour minimum you're always hearing about? It's absolutely not that cut and dry. While six to eight hours fits most, the amount of rest you need changes depending on your age, physiology, activities, and physical and mental state.\nIf you're exercising a lot, stressed, or sick, you'll need more. But also, if you're taking steps like the ones below to ensure better quality sleep, you may very well find yourself needing less. And yes, there is a thing as too much sleep, which typically throws off your whole sleep schedule.\nWhat's most important is to listen to your body, and take note of the amount of time you're getting, your sleep habits, and the activities contribute to feeling well-rested or not.\nSticking to a regular sleep schedule can help everyone\nThis one's the most demanding lifestyle change on our list, but it'll also have a big impact on your sleep quality. Basically, our brains love routine and our internal biological clocks follow a circadian rhythm closely tied to the 24-hour cycle in nature. \nFor that reason, you should really try to get to bed at around the same time every night and wake up at about the same time every morning. (Yes, even on weekends.)\nDo your best to sync your sleep with nature's 24-hour cycle because daylight induces wakefulness hormones, while night light (or lack thereof) induces sleep-promoting hormones like melatonin.\n\nI know, this may sound totally counter to your way of life (especially for night owls like myself). But while young students who pull all-nighters have brains that can handle this disruption better, the older we get, the more severe cognitive difficulties can come from messing with a regular sleep schedule.\nIf your job requires a nocturnal schedule, though, try to find ways to mimic that 24-hour light cycle: get blackout curtains for sleeping during the daytime, and maybe even a sunrise alarm clock for waking up at night.\nThe importance of getting the right kind of light throughout the day is very real. Which brings us to the most dreaded of sleep quality facts.\nSeriously, your screens are poison (but there's hope)\nListen, we get it. We're all addicted to our phones, we love watching TV before bed, and starring at a computer screen all hours of the day is basically ubiquitous to modern life. But we regret to confirm that blasting the blue light emitted from these devices into your face after sundown is like poison for quality sleep (not to mention your vision) with the potential for serious repercussions.\nChanging such an embedded behavior is a big ask, though. So try mitigating the damage with these tools and tricks:\n\n  Blue light-blocking or filtering apps for your computer, like f.lux\n  Blue light-blocking or filtering apps for your phone, like Twilight for Android and the Night Shift function on iPhone\n  Be careful with night modes, which might actually be making things worse\n  Blue light filtering glasses (some suggestions here)\n  Instead of relying on falling asleep to the TV or scrolling through social media as a pre-bed ritual, try to listen to a podcast, relaxing music, guided sleep meditation, or read a boring book. Make sure none of these are too interesting. \n\nEasier do's and don'ts\nPhew, OK, the tough ones are pretty much out of the way. So now let's focus on some easier changes and misconceptions:\n\n  Alcohol: Do not believe in the myth of the nightcap. Alcohol before bed might make you sleepy initially but, actually, once you metabolize it two to three hours later, it stimulates arousal in the brain that makes you wake up. You might not even consciously notice waking up, but your body sure will when it feels like hell the next day. \n  Caffeine: As Stevenson said, \"I’m a fan of caffeine. But I also am a fan of a caffeine curfew.\" So keep your morning coffee or afternoon soda. But pay close attention to the time you drink it, because even having caffeine six hours before bed can cause a measurable loss in sleep quality. That's because of its long half-life. Your body on average takes five to eight hours to digest 100-200 milligrams of caffeine. So if you're planning to go to bed by 10 or 11 p.m., that means your caffeine cut off time should be late in the afternoon.\n  Exercise: Physical activity can do wonders for your sleep quality, if you're exercising at the right time. The misconception that late-night workouts help you pass out is totally off-base, since exercise tends to raise your cortisol levels and suppress sleep-inducing melatonin. On the other hand, morning exercisers were found to spend more time in that important low eave deep sleep stage, and also to have more efficient sleep cycles.\n  Temperature: An often overlooked factor to sleep quality is body temperature. Our sleep is so synced with nature that, in the same way temperatures outside drop at night, our body temperature also wants to drop at night. The optimal room temperature for sleep (and this will sound very low) is generally around 62-68 degrees. A few ways to achieve that include: setting a thermostat, turning off the heater, opening a window, not wearing heavy pajamas, getting cooling bedsheets or comforters. Also, maybe even take a warm shower before bed, so when you enter your cooled bedroom your body knows to start releasing those sleep hormones and neurotransmitter enzymes.\n  Environment: Physical conditions like temperature aren't the only way to set the right environment for sleep. Another underrated factor is ensuring you feel safe in your bed, particularly for the anxious insomnia-prone. That can mean many things, like using calming essential oils or having a partner or pet share the bed. Also, try to restrict activities in the bedroom to sleep, relaxation, and sex. You don't want your brain to associate the bedroom with anything negative. If you do end up finding it easier to fall asleep someplace other than in your bedroom, do it: Fall asleep on the couch first (for example), then transition into the bedroom. If you wake up in the middle of the night and again can't sleep, leave the bedroom and do a boring or relaxing activity (read an uninteresting textbook, listen to music, etc), then go back when you get drowsy.\n\nKnow what to invest in to achieve better quality sleep\nThe sleep industry is booming right now, with all sorts of devices, apps, and mattress tech claiming to help you sleep better. According to our experts, some of those might actually be worthwhile investments. But as with all our advice, the main thing is to find what works for your specific needs. \nFor those with chronic neck and back pain, finding a better mattress with the right firmness, topper, or pillow to suit the type of sleeper (side, stomach, back) you are could fix it. Those with more anxiety and stress-related insomnia should instead look into wearables like the Ebb (which aims to keep you in that deep, low wave sleep longer), Dreamlight Sleep Mask, or Muse S smart meditation headband. You may even want to try and weighted blanket. Just do your research, because there's tons of different types best for different purposes. For sleep apnea sufferers, as we've mentioned you should talk to an expert.\nNow apps are a bit trickier. While they can for sure be a budget-conscious alternative to more expensive tech, the mileage varies on their effectiveness. Sleep trackers can provide good basic raw data and at least get you thinking more about quality over quantity. But the raw data (which itself can be flawed) is pretty useless in the common layperson's hands, who can come away with the wrong interpretation. Apps meant to soothe or calm your mind with sound are always worth a shot, though!\nSleep challenges to watch out for during the pandemic.\n\nThis all sounds fine and well under normal circumstances, but some of this advice can feel nearly impossible to follow due to the life-disruptions and stress brought on by the pandemic. \nWhen you're getting bombarded by apocalyptic news alerts and statistics, on top of mortal fear breathing down your neck — well, if you haven't developed at least a little anxious insomnia, you're probably not taking this seriously enough. \nUnfortunately, there is even less of a one-size-fits-all answer for the sleep problems coming out of these new realities. But here are a few unique obstacles that may come up and ways to try and offset them:\n\n  School and work closures will surely throw off your usual sleep routine since we have even less structure in our day-to-day. Do your best to implement curfews (on yourself and the kids) that maintain a healthy sleep schedule. Avoid the temptation to sleep in super late or stay up all night because you can. And for parents, the benefits of morning exercise prior to homeschooling can help get them to bed faster and at the right time (so you can too).\n  The desire to binge-watch comfort content is more than understandable, and also totally OK. It'd be great to turn some of that binge-watching time into physical activity too, though, using it as background noise during at-home workout sessions in the morning (here's a list of free ones).\n  Now more than ever it is imperative to stick to a screentime curfew. That's not just because of the blue light factor. With the onslaught of anxiety-inducing developments, continuing to scroll through social media or the news before bed is almost guaranteed to cause a mental spiral with health consequences that none of us can afford right now.\n  Another new challenge for bedroom screentime is that many of us are now working from home. If at all possible, separate your work-from-home space from the bedroom (though we understand that's a luxury), even if it's just with a divider. Avoid working from your bed, instead electing the couch as a comfy working spot. Both this and the curfew on news and social media will help avoid bringing all those stressors into the bedroom with you.\n\nAbove all, remember to be kind and patient with yourself. Insomniacs — no matter what the reason for their sleeplessness — can get into a cycle of panic because their stress doesn't let them sleep. Then they get more stressed from not being able to sleep. If that's you, make the goal to simply relax and breathe rather than putting pressure on yourself to sleep.\n "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1252511%252Fcec68c5e-6322-484f-b66e-80afd7d85202.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=3eddxDd9MhPiI5u8ZVCVgyG0vy4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=Pjd9TP8ETcCETuWqdelbhz7GIf4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=VUfiE4dggn8XPDNRNAAWw3ayh3I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=42bN66JiD9b57GhCAJxvKdeCHB4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

Hit Snooze is Mashable's deep dive into how we cope with our collective insomnia and the many ways we can achieve a more peaceful slumber.\n\nHave you had a difficult time drifting off to dreamland lately because **gestures vaguely at the world**? Who could blame you. \nEven before the coronavirus pandemic, many of us had a hard time getting to sleep or woke up still tired, despite our best attempt at getting a full eight hours.\nIf you're wondering how to sleep better, the good news is there are ways to optimize your resting life.  You can get better quality rest with less time, and sometimes all the time in the world won't help (or might even hinder) getting good sleep.\n\"When it comes to sleep time, quality matters. Quantity matters too, but quality is what we need for optimization,\" said Shawn Stevenson, the nutrition and wellness expert behind the New York Times bestseller Better Sleep. \nQuantity matters too, but quality is what we need for optimization.\nBut before we even go there, one caveat: Scientists actually kinda still don't know what the hell sleep even is or exactly why we do it. \n\"We believe it's the time when the body replenishes its neurotransmitters that get depleted throughout the day. It’s a time when our brains are doing the housekeeping, getting rid of unnecessary neuronal connections and solidifying new ones that are developing,\" said neurologist Dr. Randall Wright, medical director for brain wellness at Houston Methodist. \nIt may remain a mysterious phenomenon, but the benefits of quality rest are well established and pretty self-evident. When you're not getting enough quality sleep, people most often report a wide range of cognitive difficulties like headaches, memory problems, inability to concentrate, mood issues, and even depression.\nScientists can say definitively that sleep is a depressed state of consciousness that produces cyclical phases of unique brainwave patterns: wakefulness, followed by drowsiness, then light sleep, deeper sleep (also known as low wave sleep), then finally REM (rapid eye movement), which is when we dream.\nSEE ALSO: The best podcasts to fall asleep to, for every type of insomniac\n\"So when we're talking about optimizing our sleep, we're talking about optimizing those brainwaves patterns,\" said Stevenson. \"Optimal sleep is about spending the needed amount of time in each phase of sleep and transitioning in and out of those stages effectively.\"\nThe good news is that, despite the mysteries around sleep science, there are ample studies with evidence for how lifestyles and habits can improve or disrupt those stages. Both Stevenson and Wright have found that a majority of patients who come in with severe sleep issues can see a vast improvement with routine and habit changes.\n\"I'm a big fan of low-hanging fruits. Because people want change, but they don’t want to change that much,\" said Stevenson. \"And you don't have to turn your life upside down to implement changes that get results.\"\nSo here are some of the best sleep hacks to optimize for the best quality rest. Some might require more effort than others, but now more than ever, it's important to put your health first.\nSleep optimization is based on your individual needs and obstacles\nWhen it comes to improving sleep quality, there are very few one-size-fits-all solutions. Even the ones  presented here will vary depending on the unique conditions of your lifestyle, body, and issues.\n\"Before we can answer the question of how to improve your sleep, the first question we need to ask is what's keeping you from sleeping?\" said Wright. General tips work, but to be most effective, \"It's a matter of understanding who you are, recognizing your biggest underlying problems, and then finding solutions.\"\nThree common categories of sleep difficulties Include: 1) Insomnia caused by psychogenic factors like anxiety, stress, a racing mind; 2) Physical pain like chronic neck and back issues; 3) A medical condition called sleep apnea that causes you to stop breathing during sleep, disrupting your cycles.\nIn the sections below, we'll provide tips to help address each of these issues, along with general rules to follow.\n\nHow much sleep is enough?\nYou know that eight-hour minimum you're always hearing about? It's absolutely not that cut and dry. While six to eight hours fits most, the amount of rest you need changes depending on your age, physiology, activities, and physical and mental state.\nIf you're exercising a lot, stressed, or sick, you'll need more. But also, if you're taking steps like the ones below to ensure better quality sleep, you may very well find yourself needing less. And yes, there is a thing as too much sleep, which typically throws off your whole sleep schedule.\nWhat's most important is to listen to your body, and take note of the amount of time you're getting, your sleep habits, and the activities contribute to feeling well-rested or not.\nSticking to a regular sleep schedule can help everyone\nThis one's the most demanding lifestyle change on our list, but it'll also have a big impact on your sleep quality. Basically, our brains love routine and our internal biological clocks follow a circadian rhythm closely tied to the 24-hour cycle in nature. \nFor that reason, you should really try to get to bed at around the same time every night and wake up at about the same time every morning. (Yes, even on weekends.)\nDo your best to sync your sleep with nature's 24-hour cycle because daylight induces wakefulness hormones, while night light (or lack thereof) induces sleep-promoting hormones like melatonin.\n\nI know, this may sound totally counter to your way of life (especially for night owls like myself). But while young students who pull all-nighters have brains that can handle this disruption better, the older we get, the more severe cognitive difficulties can come from messing with a regular sleep schedule.\nIf your job requires a nocturnal schedule, though, try to find ways to mimic that 24-hour light cycle: get blackout curtains for sleeping during the daytime, and maybe even a sunrise alarm clock for waking up at night.\nThe importance of getting the right kind of light throughout the day is very real. Which brings us to the most dreaded of sleep quality facts.\nSeriously, your screens are poison (but there's hope)\nListen, we get it. We're all addicted to our phones, we love watching TV before bed, and starring at a computer screen all hours of the day is basically ubiquitous to modern life. But we regret to confirm that blasting the blue light emitted from these devices into your face after sundown is like poison for quality sleep (not to mention your vision) with the potential for serious repercussions.\nChanging such an embedded behavior is a big ask, though. So try mitigating the damage with these tools and tricks:\n\n  Blue light-blocking or filtering apps for your computer, like f.lux\n  Blue light-blocking or filtering apps for your phone, like Twilight for Android and the Night Shift function on iPhone\n  Be careful with night modes, which might actually be making things worse\n  Blue light filtering glasses (some suggestions here)\n  Instead of relying on falling asleep to the TV or scrolling through social media as a pre-bed ritual, try to listen to a podcast, relaxing music, guided sleep meditation, or read a boring book. Make sure none of these are too interesting. \n\nEasier do's and don'ts\nPhew, OK, the tough ones are pretty much out of the way. So now let's focus on some easier changes and misconceptions:\n\n  Alcohol: Do not believe in the myth of the nightcap. Alcohol before bed might make you sleepy initially but, actually, once you metabolize it two to three hours later, it stimulates arousal in the brain that makes you wake up. You might not even consciously notice waking up, but your body sure will when it feels like hell the next day. \n  Caffeine: As Stevenson said, \"I’m a fan of caffeine. But I also am a fan of a caffeine curfew.\" So keep your morning coffee or afternoon soda. But pay close attention to the time you drink it, because even having caffeine six hours before bed can cause a measurable loss in sleep quality. That's because of its long half-life. Your body on average takes five to eight hours to digest 100-200 milligrams of caffeine. So if you're planning to go to bed by 10 or 11 p.m., that means your caffeine cut off time should be late in the afternoon.\n  Exercise: Physical activity can do wonders for your sleep quality, if you're exercising at the right time. The misconception that late-night workouts help you pass out is totally off-base, since exercise tends to raise your cortisol levels and suppress sleep-inducing melatonin. On the other hand, morning exercisers were found to spend more time in that important low eave deep sleep stage, and also to have more efficient sleep cycles.\n  Temperature: An often overlooked factor to sleep quality is body temperature. Our sleep is so synced with nature that, in the same way temperatures outside drop at night, our body temperature also wants to drop at night. The optimal room temperature for sleep (and this will sound very low) is generally around 62-68 degrees. A few ways to achieve that include: setting a thermostat, turning off the heater, opening a window, not wearing heavy pajamas, getting cooling bedsheets or comforters. Also, maybe even take a warm shower before bed, so when you enter your cooled bedroom your body knows to start releasing those sleep hormones and neurotransmitter enzymes.\n  Environment: Physical conditions like temperature aren't the only way to set the right environment for sleep. Another underrated factor is ensuring you feel safe in your bed, particularly for the anxious insomnia-prone. That can mean many things, like using calming essential oils or having a partner or pet share the bed. Also, try to restrict activities in the bedroom to sleep, relaxation, and sex. You don't want your brain to associate the bedroom with anything negative. If you do end up finding it easier to fall asleep someplace other than in your bedroom, do it: Fall asleep on the couch first (for example), then transition into the bedroom. If you wake up in the middle of the night and again can't sleep, leave the bedroom and do a boring or relaxing activity (read an uninteresting textbook, listen to music, etc), then go back when you get drowsy.\n\nKnow what to invest in to achieve better quality sleep\nThe sleep industry is booming right now, with all sorts of devices, apps, and mattress tech claiming to help you sleep better. According to our experts, some of those might actually be worthwhile investments. But as with all our advice, the main thing is to find what works for your specific needs. \nFor those with chronic neck and back pain, finding a better mattress with the right firmness, topper, or pillow to suit the type of sleeper (side, stomach, back) you are could fix it. Those with more anxiety and stress-related insomnia should instead look into wearables like the Ebb (which aims to keep you in that deep, low wave sleep longer), Dreamlight Sleep Mask, or Muse S smart meditation headband. You may even want to try and weighted blanket. Just do your research, because there's tons of different types best for different purposes. For sleep apnea sufferers, as we've mentioned you should talk to an expert.\nNow apps are a bit trickier. While they can for sure be a budget-conscious alternative to more expensive tech, the mileage varies on their effectiveness. Sleep trackers can provide good basic raw data and at least get you thinking more about quality over quantity. But the raw data (which itself can be flawed) is pretty useless in the common layperson's hands, who can come away with the wrong interpretation. Apps meant to soothe or calm your mind with sound are always worth a shot, though!\nSleep challenges to watch out for during the pandemic.\n\nThis all sounds fine and well under normal circumstances, but some of this advice can feel nearly impossible to follow due to the life-disruptions and stress brought on by the pandemic. \nWhen you're getting bombarded by apocalyptic news alerts and statistics, on top of mortal fear breathing down your neck — well, if you haven't developed at least a little anxious insomnia, you're probably not taking this seriously enough. \nUnfortunately, there is even less of a one-size-fits-all answer for the sleep problems coming out of these new realities. But here are a few unique obstacles that may come up and ways to try and offset them:\n\n  School and work closures will surely throw off your usual sleep routine since we have even less structure in our day-to-day. Do your best to implement curfews (on yourself and the kids) that maintain a healthy sleep schedule. Avoid the temptation to sleep in super late or stay up all night because you can. And for parents, the benefits of morning exercise prior to homeschooling can help get them to bed faster and at the right time (so you can too).\n  The desire to binge-watch comfort content is more than understandable, and also totally OK. It'd be great to turn some of that binge-watching time into physical activity too, though, using it as background noise during at-home workout sessions in the morning (here's a list of free ones).\n  Now more than ever it is imperative to stick to a screentime curfew. That's not just because of the blue light factor. With the onslaught of anxiety-inducing developments, continuing to scroll through social media or the news before bed is almost guaranteed to cause a mental spiral with health consequences that none of us can afford right now.\n  Another new challenge for bedroom screentime is that many of us are now working from home. If at all possible, separate your work-from-home space from the bedroom (though we understand that's a luxury), even if it's just with a divider. Avoid working from your bed, instead electing the couch as a comfy working spot. Both this and the curfew on news and social media will help avoid bringing all those stressors into the bedroom with you.\n\nAbove all, remember to be kind and patient with yourself. Insomniacs — no matter what the reason for their sleeplessness — can get into a cycle of panic because their stress doesn't let them sleep. Then they get more stressed from not being able to sleep. If that's you, make the goal to simply relax and breathe rather than putting pressure on yourself to sleep.\n "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1252511%252Fcec68c5e-6322-484f-b66e-80afd7d85202.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=3eddxDd9MhPiI5u8ZVCVgyG0vy4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=Pjd9TP8ETcCETuWqdelbhz7GIf4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=VUfiE4dggn8XPDNRNAAWw3ayh3I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=42bN66JiD9b57GhCAJxvKdeCHB4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=aHIrvUFgF_LdVguuBN8zSylJkXw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=zIEK6C2Q8p4eiD0IwzqyquNU3EQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Optimize your sleep with these hacks (even during a pandemic)","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=VUfiE4dggn8XPDNRNAAWw3ayh3I=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=2o2lR7PIFTMYfUGamwINocB8qo4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=b_CnFxtgXB6eU-z7TGhrE56aDyU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=aHIrvUFgF_LdVguuBN8zSylJkXw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112206%252F3872925d-c4ac-4cb8-b1ce-baba6995b8a6.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=VUfiE4dggn8XPDNRNAAWw3ayh3I=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Optimize your sleep with these hacks (even during a pandemic)","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"We need the health benefits of quality sleep now more than ever.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","sponsored_by":"","sponsored_by_url":"","order_number":"","tweet_text":"Optimize your sleep with these hacks (even during a pandemic)"},{"_id":"5d4f1aa9ca2f0c1c4800000c","id":"/article/how-to-block-reduce-robocalls-without-using-third-party-apps/","title":"How to block and reduce robocalls without using data-harvesting third-party apps","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2019-08-10T19:27:34+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 10 Aug 2019 19:27:34 +0000","formatted_date":"08/10/2019","sort_key":"1HWAmZ","link":"https://mashable.com/article/how-to-block-reduce-robocalls-without-using-third-party-apps/","content":{"plain":"Robocalls are a menace to modern society. So you resort to a third-party app to block them and all's well, right? Actually, no.\nAs it turns out, many popular robocall-blocking apps such as TrapCall and Truecaller don't have your best interests in mind.\nAccording to TechCrunch and Dan Hastings, a security researcher at NCC Group, many top robocall-blocking apps share your phone number with analytics firms and uploading device information such as device type and software version to companies like Facebook without your explicit consent,\nYikes!\nAnd while some these apps released \"fixes\" after getting caught red-handed, the damage is already done. How can you even trust any of them anymore? You could go and read their lengthy privacy policies to see exactly what data they collect, or you can find another way to block and reduce robocalls without using third-party apps. Here's how you can do that.\n1. Register your number on the Do Not Call List\nAccording to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), one of the simplest ways to block robocalls and telemarketers is to register your phone number on the Do Not Call List, which makes it illegal for them to call you.\nIt's not foolproof. I added my phone number to the list over a decade ago and still get calls from telemarketers, but I'm sure I would get way more if I didn't. Do yourself a solid and add your number.\nNote: It takes 31 days for telemarketers to stop calling your number once it's on the Do Not Call List. So be patient.\n2. If you own a Pixel, use Call Screen\n\nOriginally available only on the Pixel 3 and 3XL, Google's handy Call Screen feature now works on all Pixels, including the Pixel and Pixel XL, Pixel 2 and 2XL, Pixel 3 and 3XL, and Pixel 3a and 3a XL.\nWith Call Screen, the Google Assistant answers phone calls on your behalf and transcribes the conversation in real time.\nIn most cases sending a robocall to Call Screen is enough to get them to hang up immediately. Even if the robocall is persistent, at least you can see that it's spam based on the transcription on your screen, and don't pick up the call.\n3. On iOS 13, send them to voicemail\niOS 13 won't be releasing until September, but if you've already got the developer beta or public beta installed on your iPhone, you can send calls from unknown numbers directly to voicemail — perfect for robocalls.\n\nThe setting needs to be switched on in Settings > Phone > Silence Unknown Callers but once you've got it set, your iPhone will only allow calls from phone numbers in your contacts, messages, and mail apps.\n4. Use your carrier's blocking tools\nCheck with your carrier to see if they have any tools that'll let you block robocalls. Some carriers like AT&T have free apps like Call Protect, but because we're trying to avoid robocall-blocking apps, you'll have to turn to other options.\nFor example, Verizon has a \"Call Filter\" feature that costs $2.99 per month per line and provides the following: spam detection, spam filter, report numbers, caller ID, personal spam list, personal block list, risk meter, and spam lookup.\nA free version of Call Filter is available to all postpaid Verizon customers (sorry prepaid people!) and only includes three features: spam detection, spam filter, and report numbers.\nSprint also offers a similar feature to Call Filter called \"Premium Caller ID\" for $2.99 a month; this service only identifies robocalls, but doesn't block them. To do that, you'll need to block them on manually (see below).\nOn T-Mobile, customers can turn on Scam ID and Scam Block. With Scam ID, if a phone number appears fishy, your phone will display \"Scam Likely\" so you know not to pick up. Scam Block lets you block these \"Scam Likely\" calls.\n5. Block their numbers\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. If a robocall manages to get through to you, end the call and block the number ASAP. It's old school, but it ensures the same spam number will never call you again.\nOn iOS, you can tap the little \"i\" icon next to the call in the phone app's \"Recents\" section and then go down to \"Block this caller\".\nSame goes for Samsung phones running the latest One UI. In the \"Recents\" section of the phone app, tap on a number and then the \"i\" icon and then \"Block.\" You'll be asked to confirm the number block and that's it.\nOn Pixel phones, there's a \"Block/report spam\" setting after you tap a phone number within the phone app's \"Recents\" tab.\nThe setting might be located somewhere else on other Android phones, but most phones should have the ability to block phone numbers.\nWATCH: How to stop robocalls and spammers — Clarification Please"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1028775%252F027d78ff-8e03-499a-8fda-6dd7a4071212.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=8ChSHfAhHCdzy77gDi7zhQ7fb38=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=p5AhsKjqvr0zggbwSF9lAj-MPTo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=4Wqq6gzWexXjlTea_EWIZxoo2E4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=1BuTudL8rFGphcF5G1WGQs3B-5g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=2JAKVrdGjZZVMwSK4CRYjUdGryQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=wviRLdaDIls5Iggc_OJpdGhDDOc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"How to block and reduce robocalls without using data-harvesting third-party apps","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=4Wqq6gzWexXjlTea_EWIZxoo2E4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=2JAKVrdGjZZVMwSK4CRYjUdGryQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100906%252F1134c0a4-b5e3-46eb-aaac-f519e63221e4.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=4Wqq6gzWexXjlTea_EWIZxoo2E4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"How to block and reduce robocalls without using data-harvesting third-party apps","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"6k01YrLZ0V","data-ytid":"GPJF2Fjyl9I","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Try these five tips instead.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"How to block and reduce robocalls without using data-harvesting third-party apps"},{"_id":"5d11076bca2f0c4ced00000d","id":"/article/how-to-download-macos-catalina-beta/","title":"macOS Catalina: 3 features that make it worth the upgrade","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2019-06-24T17:24:57+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 17:24:57 +0000","formatted_date":"06/24/2019","sort_key":"1HFHmN","link":"https://mashable.com/article/how-to-download-macos-catalina-beta/","content":{"plain":"Attention Mac users: You can now test drive the next version of Apple's desktop operating system, macOS Catalina, months before it's officially released in the fall.\nBefore we get into how to install the public beta version of Catalina, let's talk about why you should upgrade. Besides keeping your Mac safe with security patches (always welcome!), Catalina has a couple of standout features that'll make you more productive.\nWe won't highlight them all, but the following three are the big ones.\n1. Sidecar\n\nIf you own an iPad (running the new iPadOS), you can turn that sucker into a second screen for your Mac using Sidecar. Anyone who's ever used Duet Display knows how useful it is to connect an iPad to a MacBook and get a two-display setup.\nSidecar is like Duet Display on steroids. There are two ways to use Sidecar: wired and wireless (Bluetooth and WiFi) and both modes worked extremely well in my tests. I saw virtually no lag when dragging app windows from a 13-inch MacBook Pro to an 12.9-inch iPad Pro or iPad Air (2019). Similarly, mirroring a Mac screen to an iPad was glitch-free.\n\nHands-down, my favorite feature with Sidecar is Apple Pencil support. In addition to using an Apple Pencil for drawing, which essentially turns your iPad into a Wacom drawing tablet, you can also use it to point-and-click your way around iPadOS as if it was a mouse.\nI also appreciate that there's a \"Sidebar\" on the left side with Apple keyboard modifier keys (Command, Option, Control, Shift) and Touch Bar controls (for apps that support it) on the bottom even if your Mac doesn't have a Touch Bar.\nWhether you're a student or video editor who wants a portable secondary screen to extend your MacBook screen or an artist who might use it as a Wacom substitute, Sidecar is low-key the best feature in Catalina in my opinion.\n2. Voice Control\n\nWhile Catalina's new Voice Control feature is considered an accessibility feature for people with disabilities, everyone can use it.\nUnlike Siri, which uses natural language to answer questions, play music, and fetch the weather, Voice Control is a little more mechanical. The feature recognizes specific voice commands, and while you can record your own, there is a learning curve to using Voice Control.\n\nI wasn't able to become as proficient with Voice Control as the person in the video above, but for basic commands like opening apps and navigating to menus, it was nice to be able to do them hands-free.\nWith more time and practice, I think power users will be able to develop a workflow that mixes both keyboard shortcuts and Voice Control. For example, I just said \"double click\" to highlight a word and bring up a toolbar to format text, which was much easier than highlighting it with my trackpad. Ditto for using voice commands for closing and minimizing windows.\n3. iPad apps\n\nIf there's anything the Mac needs more of, it's apps. Rather than force developers to build new apps specifically for macOS, Apple's allowing developers to easily port their iPad apps to Catalina using a new tool called Project Catalyst.\nUsing Catalyst, developers can convert their iPad apps into Mac apps — complete with Mac-like elements such as menu bars, resizable windows, and keyboard shortcuts — without having to recode everything from scratch. Catalyst is going to be great for small developers who don't have the resources to split their time between iOS and Mac.\nIn addition to being great for developers, iPad apps on the Mac will be great for users, too. Many apps like Twitter, Jira Cloud, and Rosetta Stone will include features not possible within a web browser. \nI'm most excited for the new wave of games on Macs with mouse and keyboard support. For example, Gameloft has already committed to bringing one of my favorite iOS games, arcade racer Asphalt 9, to macOS using Catalyst. Does this mean the Mac's finally getting serious about gaming? The Mac won't suddenly kill PCs, but imagine a playable version of Fortnite on your MacBook Pro. Somebody please tell Epic Games to make it happen!\nOverall, iPad apps on the Mac is going to benefit everyone and give macOS the revitalization it needs.\nHow to download and install\nOK, now that you have solid reasons to update to macOS Catalina, here's how to install the public beta.\nStep 1: Make sure your Mac is compatible with macOS Catalina. The following Macs can be upgraded to the new OS:\n\n  MacBook (early 2015 or later)\n  MacBook Air (mid 2012 or later) \n  MacBook Pro (mid 2012 or later)\n  Mac mini (late 2012 or later)\n  iMac (late 2012 or later)\n  iMac Pro (2017)\n  Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later) \n\nIf you're not sure which model your Mac is, click on the  in the upper left corner of your menu bar and then go to \"About This Mac\" to find out.\nStep 2: Back up your Mac. There are many ways to do that. Whether you use macOS' built-in Time Machine feature or manually transfer all your files to external storage, please back up your data. You're dealing with buggy pre-release software so it is possible something might go wrong.\nStep 3: Register for a beta account at beta.apple.com if you haven't previously tested any Apple beta software.\nStep 4: Enroll your Mac here and then click on \"macOS Public Beta Access Utility\" (it's a big blue button). Double-click the macOSPublicBetaAccessUtility.dmg file after it's downloaded and follow the installer's prompts.\nStep 5: The installer should then open the Mac App Store. Click \"Update\" to install the public beta version of macOS Catalina. You'll likely be asked to reboot your Mac to complete the installation.\nStep 6: 😎🍏💻\nWATCH: Apple recalls MacBook Pro, cites 'fire safety risk'"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1005385%252F6b17c89a-5bd3-42c9-b4d6-1382f82db5e7.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=yIc5ZXvzReAoI5PvpVsKMkExfLo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F98369%252F47e75242-b8cb-4084-8f15-428429ab2295.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=jQ4nAKIrIYi30Fk4wy_7uGLKwAA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F98369%252F47e75242-b8cb-4084-8f15-428429ab2295.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=rfi1Ktgc6xEFdpZkUFAV3mGJRVI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F98369%252F47e75242-b8cb-4084-8f15-428429ab2295.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=2VH-E7RzuHD-KHEP9rYUK7lIQ6o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F98369%252F47e75242-b8cb-4084-8f15-428429ab2295.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=kZHtE6x1EpBXDF2w84BbCZ3L15k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F98369%252F47e75242-b8cb-4084-8f15-428429ab2295.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=atiX3GaVR5agEgOPik8ULrl3XE0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"macOS Catalina: 3 features that make it worth the upgrade","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F98369%252F47e75242-b8cb-4084-8f15-428429ab2295.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=rfi1Ktgc6xEFdpZkUFAV3mGJRVI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F98369%252F47e75242-b8cb-4084-8f15-428429ab2295.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=kZHtE6x1EpBXDF2w84BbCZ3L15k=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F98369%252F47e75242-b8cb-4084-8f15-428429ab2295.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=rfi1Ktgc6xEFdpZkUFAV3mGJRVI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"macOS Catalina: 3 features that make it worth the upgrade","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gElYVmPQoQ","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"You can now install the public beta of macOS Catalina.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"macOS Catalina: 3 features that make it worth the upgrade"},{"_id":"5c4fbee3ca2f0c630c00004d","id":"/article/how-to-turn-off-facetime/","title":"Here's how to disable FaceTime on your iPhone, iPad or Mac","title_tag":null,"author":"Johnny Lieu","post_date":"2019-01-29T02:47:59+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 02:47:59 +0000","formatted_date":"01/29/2019","sort_key":"1GOkGM","link":"https://mashable.com/article/how-to-turn-off-facetime/","content":{"plain":"A nasty bug which lets you hear and see someone at the end of a FaceTime call -- without them answering -- has been pretty concerning.\nWhile Apple has said it will be rolling out a fix to the issue later this week, you'll want to disable the feature for the time being.\nSEE ALSO: Disastrous FaceTime bug lets you spy on person you're calling\nThis means you'll need to switch FaceTime off on each Apple device you own.

a trend that plenty of websites and apps have embraced. \nHulu is joining the party by rolling out Night Mode to all web users. It swaps the traditionally brighter colors of an interface for darker tones, like grey or black. For classic software users or fans of Slack, it's akin to changing the theme. \nNight Mode on Hulu's web version changes the whole site, from the homepage to the search box and the show pages. Switching to darker colors can lessen eye strain, but can make consuming content a more immersive experience. Sound like it's up your alley? Night Mode is available for all Hulu users now.\nSEE ALSO: How to set up parental controls on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu\nHere's how to enable Night Mode on Hulu Web.\n1. Log in to Hulu\n\nThis step may be self-explanatory, but you need to subscribe to Hulu before you can change out a theme. Just enter your username and password to authenticate. \n2. Hover over your profile\n\nMoving the mouse over your profile name in the top right-hand corner will cause a menu to appear. \n3. Flip on Night Mode\n\nOn that drop down menu, click the toggle button next to Night Mode to dim in the lights. Hulu has done an excellent job implementing this across the service, including the homepage, show pages, and menus.\n4. Break out the popcorn\n\nIt's as simple as that. The darker theme will really help to put spooky films in the right mode. Even better, Night Mode will be available year-round, so you can dim the lights and immerse yourself whenever you want. \nHappy viewing! \nWATCH: You won't feel so good if you watched this before watching 'Avengers: Infinity War"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F865968%252F3aede02f-7ca0-475e-b973-12f86b5e390d.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Wm3HbYzvSp1Xb7emIuMjrOrrBrg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82608%252F0282c0da-9947-44bd-8e04-c2cc21d8c855.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=g3hYl5tKrtPxHdmsq2PgcSOu0Ic=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82608%252F0282c0da-9947-44bd-8e04-c2cc21d8c855.png%252F356x205.png?signature=UznYO-g0t4Gkc6jZsacLgTfvr1I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82608%252F0282c0da-9947-44bd-8e04-c2cc21d8c855.png%252F712x410.png?signature=qI19SfYaenxN7PQC05pJF4OfIeQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82608%252F0282c0da-9947-44bd-8e04-c2cc21d8c855.png%252F280x157.png?signature=2M7B9ppIe4S25ERnYWrdJfHSaxw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82608%252F0282c0da-9947-44bd-8e04-c2cc21d8c855.png%252F560x314.png?signature=Q3W84SlVc-XeoOqCHvG_aNXKv6w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"How to turn on Hulu's Night Mode","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82608%252F0282c0da-9947-44bd-8e04-c2cc21d8c855.png%252F356x205.png?signature=UznYO-g0t4Gkc6jZsacLgTfvr1I=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82608%252F0282c0da-9947-44bd-8e04-c2cc21d8c855.png%252F280x157.png?signature=2M7B9ppIe4S25ERnYWrdJfHSaxw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F82608%252F0282c0da-9947-44bd-8e04-c2cc21d8c855.png%252F356x205.png?signature=UznYO-g0t4Gkc6jZsacLgTfvr1I=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"How to turn on Hulu's Night Mode","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG2kaQ0N","data-ytid":"2ecr4fkKhbQ","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Finally, you can dim the lights on Hulu.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"How to turn on Hulu's Night Mode"},{"_id":"5b92a27df11b2c7d5c000619","id":"/review/what-is-a-vpn/","title":"What is a VPN?","title_tag":null,"author":"Charles Poladian","post_date":"2018-09-07T16:08:30+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:08:30 +0000","formatted_date":"09/07/2018","sort_key":"1FYjjC","link":"https://mashable.com/review/what-is-a-vpn/","content":{"plain":"There seems to be a new reason to worry about your internet privacy almost every day. Rollbacks on privacy regulations, abuses of personal data, and so much more. If only there was some way to regain control of your privacy....\nTurns out, a virtual private network (VPN) is the answer to such a question. Once limited to users with more technical knowhow, modern VPN services combine ease with security. If you ever wanted to learn more about VPNs, we’re here to help.\nWhat is an IP address?\nBefore diving deeper in VPNs, we have to talk about how you access the internet. An internet protocol (IP) address acts much like your home address. It’s a series of numbers used to uniquely identify your computer on the internet. Much like how physical addresses are standardized, the internet protocol standardizes a computer’s address. This defines how information is sent, distributed, and returned. Otherwise it’d be sheer chaos on the internet. Imagine if you had John.Computer.1234 as one address and another address that’s 100 characters long.\nSEE ALSO: IPVanish review: A VPN that gets the job done\nYou can see the endless possibilities for addresses in this scenario and the confusion that would inevitably follow. IP adds much-needed structure by standardizing addresses. This set of rules is currently in its fourth version and your IP address is an IPv4 internet address. \nYou’ve probably heard that we’ve run out of IP addresses and that’s technically true. IPv4 consists of 32 bits and can support 4.29 billion addresses. All of those available addresses have been allocated, but not all of them have been used and the overwhelming majority of internet addresses are IPv4 addresses. The latest IP version, IPv6, uses 128-bit addresses and can support 340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses. Now that IPv6 is available, we won’t have to worry about IP address scarcity again anytime soon.\n\n \n\nAny devices that accesses the internet is assigned an IP address. For us, that means our Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigned an IP address to your router. If you’re on WiFi, your individual devices have their own assigned IP addresses. Since your IP address comes from your ISP, it has your name, location, and all your web activity attached to it. If your ISP was ever hacked, that data could fall in the hands of a bad actor. And if compelled, your ISP could hand over your data, say, in compliance with a warrant. It could also issue warnings on behalf of copyright holders if you were engaging in piracy.\n\nThat might make you think that, if you’re not doing anything illegal, there’s no harm in your ISP having that information, but law-abiding internet users still have reason to be concerned: new internet privacy rules limiting what an ISP could do with your data were rolled back in 2017. President Donald Trump signed the repeal into law, and ISPs can now collect and, at least in theory, use your personal data for marketing purposes.\nThat's is an unlikely scenario, but it’s troubling to know that your data is in the hands of a third party, and you don’t have a say in how it may or may not be used. Additionally, privacy controversies surrounding Facebook and other services leading to our current state of affairs have only added to our security concerns. \nThere are ways to regain control of your internet privacy. A virtual private network (VPN) can mask your internet activity with minimal tech savvy.\nHow to protect your privacy\nWe often don’t have a lot of choice with our ISPs. In many regions, there are often just one or two options. It’s a convoluted history full of loopholes and political maneuvering (especially in the U.S.) that have led to the limited amount of choice for millions of users.\nVPNs are a way for users to win back some control. Remember: All of your information and activity is known to your ISP because of your IP address. By changing your IP address, you can sidestep your ISP and mask your internet activity. A VPN lets you do that by routing your activity through its own servers. To anyone looking at your activity, you’ll have a new IP address that could be in a different state or even a different country. \nSEE ALSO: Facebook to pull its creepy VPN Onavo from App Store after Apple pushback\nVPNs work by encrypting your activity through a tunnel that’s created between you and the VPN's server, according to Cisco. Your data could be broken down into packets, encoded, and then decrypted by the VPN server through the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This shields your activity and data so you can start surfing the web anonymously. \nAES is just one type of encryption protocol a VPN can use. OpenVPN is another popular protocol to create encrypted tunnels that will protect your data as you connect to a VPN. There are other encryption protocols that are less popular because of safety concerns. \nOther encryption protocols add another layer of security by encrypting your data multiple times. While your data is more secure, your speed will suffer as the VPN works to decrypt multiple layers of encryption. Think of it like a handshake. A secret handshake gets you through the door of a popular nightclub if that’s the policy. It’s a quick, but effective way to determine if you should have access to the club. But if the club requires multiple handshakes, that’ll take more time as you pass through all the security checks.\nA quick example: You purchase a subscription to a popular VPN service and download an app for your Mac or PC. After setting up your account, you click on the connect button. You’re not doing anything at this moment, but the VPN is authenticating who you are and if you should have access to their servers. After confirming this, a tunnel between you and a server is created. All of your activity goes through this tunnel as you connect to a server that’s not owned by your ISP. A VPN will assign a new IP address from its server in, say, Atlanta, Georgia even though you’re in Westchester, New York.\nAll of your data is secure and your internet activity is untraceable. This is great if you’re concerned about your privacy or using an unsecured public WiFi connection. In the U.S., a VPN is a great solution for your security. It’s not a necessity, but it’s a viable alternative to protect your privacy. \nWhile the United States has some surveillance concerns, internet usage is, for the most part, unrestricted. Websites are not blocked from the public, you can download whatever programs you want, use a VPN, or even access the Tor network if you want to dive into the “dark web.” \nThat’s not the case in other countries that may have more restrictive internet regulations. In some countries, websites are blocked and internet usage is actively monitored. If you live in a country like this, a VPN is almost a necessity. VPNs are also beneficial for frequent travelers as a secure connection regardless of country or policy.\n\nA VPN can be used to bypass regional restrictions on some services. VPNs could let you access Netflix content from another country, for example. Netflix has been actively cracking down on VPN and proxy usage, so finding a VPN that lets you view UK content from the U.S., for example,  is getting harder and harder. \nIf you happen to frequently use peer-to-peer (P2P) services, you should consider using a VPN. While torrents have gotten a bad rap for piracy, many users use these file transfer services for totally legit reasons. Rather than get flagged for your P2P activity, you should start using a VPN. \nNow that we know the ins and outs of VPNs and what they’re used for, you’re probably ready to download the first service you find. Before you do that, there are just a few more things to consider before selecting a VPN. \nWhat to look for in a VPN\nNot all VPNs are created equal. While all VPN services are trying to do the same thing, the results will vary.\nPrivacy is the main concern with any VPN. Finding the best VPN for you means paying attention to that service’s privacy practices. All VPNs will have encrypted tunnel, but see if they have additional security features. One popular option is a malware blocker. \nAnother security layer is a killswitch. This feature is handy if you’re using public WiFi and you suddenly become disconnected. If that happens, your data and personal information will no longer be protected, but theoretically still accessible to others on the local network. That's why it may be important to you to have a VPN that automatically shuts down all connectivity if your connection drops. \nSEE ALSO: TunnelBear review: A VPN for the rest of us\nSome countries monitor activity that looks like it’s coming from a VPN. One way to prevent added scrutiny is to obscure the fact that you’re using a VPN. Obfuscation (sometimes called “stealth” or “ghost”) VPN services masks activity so it looks more like regular activity. \nAnother thing to consider when choosing a VPN is data leaks. An encrypted tunnel is not foolproof and your activity may be exposed. This is known as a domain name system (DNS) leak. If a website you visit requests your IP address and what’s returned is your original IP address, you have a DNS leak. A quick Google search can point you to a resource listing leaky VPNs.\nWhile these are handy features, perhaps the most important privacy concern centers on the company itself. You can quickly see strengths and weakness of a VPN service by reading their respective privacy policies. Many VPNs tout a “no log” policy, which means the only data they collect may be related to your purchase. This could include your email, but they collect no other data that could potentially expose you or your usage of a VPN. This is the best policy available and one should actively seek with any VPN service. That means having to trust the company that they are not actually collect any data. \n\nThat level of trust is easier to achieve depending on where the company is headquartered. If the VPN service is located in the U.S., you should be more cautious over any no-log claim. That’s because the U.S. has intelligence agreements with 14 other countries. The core group, known as the Five Eyes alliance, is an intelligence-sharing agreement between the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Other countries have joined this alliance with varying levels of membership. The full alliance, known as 14 Eyes, includes the five countries and Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Spain, and Sweden. If a VPN is headquartered in one of these 14 countries, they may be sharing personal data. \nThere are other countries, such as Panama or Romania, that have strong data laws bolstering internet privacy. If a company is headquartered in one of these countries, it’s easier to believe in their claims.\nPrivacy aside, speed is a huge factor when finding the right VPN for you. You will never use a VPN if your internet speed is more of a crawl than a sprint. Find a VPN with a lot of local servers and check to see what speeds they are guaranteeing. Do your research, read reviews, and test it out for yourself. Most VPN services have money-back policies, so give those a spin.\nSEE ALSO: NordVPN review: The VPN for power users\nThere are three variables to consider depending on your needs. If you love bypassing regional locks and want to view Netflix without borders, only a handful of VPNs can successfully bypass the watchful eye of Netflix. The second variable is P2P access. Some VPNs specialize in optimizing P2P service, so that’s something to consider if you regularly transfer large files on torrent sites.\nIf you happen to travel to China a lot, only a few VPN services have successfully bypassed the “Great Firewall.” Make sure you have one of these VPNs downloaded before entering the country.\nThere are many readily available resources to help you choose a VPN that’s right for your needs. Now, go out there and take control of your privacy.\nEditor’s Note: IPVanish is owned by J2 Global, the parent company of Ziff Davis, Mashable’s publisher.

But with Gmail's recent massive overhaul, Google snuck in little, nagging orange reminders to some emails, asking if you want to reply to an email that you may have received a few days prior.\n\nThose annoying gremlins have a name: They're called Nudges, and they're automatically enabled with the Gmail update.\nMaybe you love the Nudges, in which case, we're not here to judge. But if you're part of the #NeverNudge community, here's how to turn them off.\nHead over to Settings, click the General tab, and scroll down to the Nudges section. Uncheck the box. That's all there is to it.\nSEE ALSO: Why One Guy Is Accidentally Getting Thousands of Your Emails\nThere are two types of Nudges: those that remind you to reply to someone's email sent to you, and those that remind you to follow up on emails you've sent (to which you haven't received a reply), and you can toggle either on or off. Gmail uses an algorithm to nudge these emails to the top of your inbox. \nYou can also just revert back to classic Gmail, as Nudges aren't available in that old-timey world, but if that's too drastic for you, hopefully this solution fits your bill. \nFingers crossed Google issues more customizable options to Nudges -- like, why not let users select emails to be nudged if they're sent from people in your organization, or if it's marked high priority? Time will tell. For now, head over to settings and turn it off. \nWATCH: From balloons to satellites, here’s how big tech is battling it out to bring internet to the most remote areas"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F834951%252Ff4210ec0-9056-43b3-8389-c4f84b08ccc0.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=m-HRXRwYKWyD7naHGaSISlJ5ZSY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79197%252F5e8321ce-afe9-4a17-8b76-bbd8e77b360f.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=yHKx2IRzECNR9KkIVimPMmccSqQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79197%252F5e8321ce-afe9-4a17-8b76-bbd8e77b360f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=uxIpvx21RfBBV5C6bI-GOY5cUzY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79197%252F5e8321ce-afe9-4a17-8b76-bbd8e77b360f.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=SG50MdQSXtv4Zx4woFDp3RJ2F-w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79197%252F5e8321ce-afe9-4a17-8b76-bbd8e77b360f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=kf6knj89lZz8hAgKi7fKskDjpVs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79197%252F5e8321ce-afe9-4a17-8b76-bbd8e77b360f.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=kNIYWCN8lg-P56OBbu1nxajT9gA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Banish those annoying Gmail 'Nudges' from your inbox","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79197%252F5e8321ce-afe9-4a17-8b76-bbd8e77b360f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=uxIpvx21RfBBV5C6bI-GOY5cUzY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79197%252F5e8321ce-afe9-4a17-8b76-bbd8e77b360f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=kf6knj89lZz8hAgKi7fKskDjpVs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79197%252F5e8321ce-afe9-4a17-8b76-bbd8e77b360f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=uxIpvx21RfBBV5C6bI-GOY5cUzY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Banish those annoying Gmail 'Nudges' from your inbox","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"63nwkgx1n5","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Whether you love them or hate them, here's how kill those Nudges.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Banish those annoying Gmail 'Nudges' from your inbox"},{"_id":"5b91ab42f11b2c7d5c000109","id":"/article/instagram-stories-copy-paste-gif-images-how-to/","title":"Here's the astonishingly simple hack to spice up your Instagram Stories","title_tag":null,"author":"Jake Krol","post_date":"2018-09-06T22:33:39+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 06 Sep 2018 22:33:39 +0000","formatted_date":"09/06/2018","sort_key":"1FY2QE","link":"https://mashable.com/article/instagram-stories-copy-paste-gif-images-how-to/","content":{"plain":"Instagram Stories have become a dominant force in our visual-obsessed culture, and a little-known hack is about to make it a bit GIF-ier.\nFor this tutorial, a third-party keyboard is your secret weapon (Gboard, Bitmoji, and Giphy are all good options).\nSEE ALSO: Instagram turns to Facebook roots with university-based groupings\nBut before we get started, we should point out that Instagram's partnership with Giphy has already made it easy to insert some GIFs into your stories -- the problem is that the in-app database doesn't include every GIF you could ever want.\nBut with this trick, noticed by Matt Navarra on Twitter, users can copy a GIF from, say Google Images, Tumblr, or GIF sites, paste it natively in an Instagram Story, and then arrange it however you want. The world of GIFs is your oyster. \nAndroid users are able to take GIFs directly from the third-party keyboard, while iOS users can copy from third-party keyboards as well as apps.\n\nStep 1: Grab your GIF\nFor Boomerang, Superzoom, Focus, Rewind, Normal and Hands-Free Instagram Stories, click to input text, as you typically would. Then switch to your desired third-party keyboard, find an image or GIF, copy it, and then paste it in. I've tested this with Giphy and Bitmoji keyboards and the results were terrific -- that's right, whereas Bitmoji was originally a Snapchat exclusive, this trick now makes it available on Instagram.\n\nIt's a bit more complicated for a \"Text\" Instagram Story. For this, you'll need to type something first -- something simple, like a period or \"hi\" -- and then hit the circular white arrow. On the next screen,  click the \"A\" in the top right-hand corner to input more text. Now you can insert your GIF and follow the copy-and-paste steps from above. It's easy to delete that original period you wrote to unlock the second screen by clicking on it and hitting the delete key.\nStickers apps and some third-party keyboards don't work for this yet on either iOS or Android. For now, this hack works best with images and GIFs.\n\nStep 2: Put your GIF down, flip it, and reverse it\nMy favorite part about this trick is the ability to manipulate the GIF. For instance, take a GIF of Young Donna from Mamma Mia! and turn her upside-down. Or throw some loving puppies on a slant, add some glittery sparkles, change the world.\nBoom. There you have it. You now have no excuse for posting a boring Instagram Story ever again.\nWATCH: Apple AirPods totally change the game"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F835644%252F800b31c5-fc53-46cf-a525-c87bb045a3ee.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=bc09LsPydYUGVxeFcw_TvBTn4DE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79915%252F407b7d84-dd98-4d12-9fe7-ecc2a09ee69e.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=GMNXpymEi5CTX3L-TyXLmvlfvJU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79915%252F407b7d84-dd98-4d12-9fe7-ecc2a09ee69e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=8SsDAcJ8IX6isY8u3Yx_73eu7T8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79915%252F407b7d84-dd98-4d12-9fe7-ecc2a09ee69e.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=wUyxq3GE2ywKPh8w0jmGNNunMCI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79915%252F407b7d84-dd98-4d12-9fe7-ecc2a09ee69e.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=TvpxfSGW2GCyIsnXiAaDO3q44W0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79915%252F407b7d84-dd98-4d12-9fe7-ecc2a09ee69e.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=2cIE33qDd9-0dNY-607piCqtkKg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Here's the astonishingly simple hack to spice up your Instagram Stories","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79915%252F407b7d84-dd98-4d12-9fe7-ecc2a09ee69e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=8SsDAcJ8IX6isY8u3Yx_73eu7T8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79915%252F407b7d84-dd98-4d12-9fe7-ecc2a09ee69e.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=TvpxfSGW2GCyIsnXiAaDO3q44W0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F79915%252F407b7d84-dd98-4d12-9fe7-ecc2a09ee69e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=8SsDAcJ8IX6isY8u3Yx_73eu7T8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Here's the astonishingly simple hack to spice up your Instagram Stories","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"8P0BJZRR01","data-source":"blueprint"},{"data-slug":"O2op18ex0m","data-source":"blueprint"},{"data-slug":"MboWbAXpl8","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Bitmoji is arriving in Instagram.

It's happening where Lake Michigan meets Lake Huron, at a place called the Straits of Mackinac. There, fat slabs and mounds of cracked blue ice have collected near the shorelines.\nLocal photographer Tori Burley captured the image above. \nSEE ALSO: Gas-filled vessel barrels solo through pathetic Arctic sea ice during dead of winter\nThe ice, however, is not actually turning blue. The color is a result of the way sunlight is bouncing off this particular ice, explained Ted Scambos, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, in an interview. \nSometimes, weather conditions — such as a lack of high winds — allow water to freeze slowly and evenly, resulting in ice composed of large crystals (unlike snow, which is formed quickly and made up of small crystals). \nWhen light hits these big ice crystals, it can travel deep into the structures (compare this to snow, wherein light hits a sharp edge and reflects off of it right away, resulting in blinding white). When the light travels deeper into slowly formed ice, some of the red wavelengths of sunlight — which is the longest wavelength of visible light — get absorbed into the ice structure. \nThe blue, which is the shortest wavelength of visible light, bounces back out, meet our eyes, and results in a deep aqua color.  \n\nBut this isn't the complete story. Blue ice is also composed of relatively pure, untainted water, which allows the blue reflection to be so vivid and dominant.\n\"It's a tribute to how clean the upper surface of Lake Michigan is,\" said Scambos, adding, \"At least somewhere in Lake Michigan.\" \nWATCH: 'Beast from the East' to plunge UK, rest of Europe into historic deep freeze"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F724361%252Fc740f53f-992f-45dd-a5be-d2606e212621.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=RRWeSTyA3R6ndxupljGYX-PvENU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F69797%252F851dfd94-1702-4d67-b54f-08d3a91f265a.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=-pL4kXoREWq54DbeqUnzSJ_8dB0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F69797%252F851dfd94-1702-4d67-b54f-08d3a91f265a.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=j3BAojN5_l0FGOXcaUeNmLrqV7Y=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F69797%252F851dfd94-1702-4d67-b54f-08d3a91f265a.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=Nh5_Sy5GN6Kp_cxPCOZktkq4vc4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F69797%252F851dfd94-1702-4d67-b54f-08d3a91f265a.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=Dxyjgdma_8xlJzqWgN8OXsJf5pg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F69797%252F851dfd94-1702-4d67-b54f-08d3a91f265a.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=7zsMW58EJkITw-8yphehmzQSHvs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"The ice on Lake Michigan has turned blue.
