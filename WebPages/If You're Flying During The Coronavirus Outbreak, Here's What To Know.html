As the infection rate rises, hundreds of thousands of people are <a class="PlU" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-flight-cancellations-top-200000-sending-jet-fuel-lower.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">canceling or rebooking their flights</a> for a later date — but that doesn't mean you should rush to cancel yours just yet.

       <h2>How Is Coronavirus Affecting Spring &amp; Summer Flights? </h2>
       <p>Keep in mind that the State Department is advising all Americans to <a class="PlU" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid international travel right now</a>. "In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period," the department's travel advisories site warns. "U.S. citizens who live abroad should avoid all international travel." Here's how major U.S. airlines are responding: </p>
       <p><strong>American Airlines: </strong></p>
       <ul>
        <li><a class="PlU" href="http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-Announces-Additional-Schedule-Suspensions-in-Response-to-Reduced-Customer-Demand-Related-to-Covid-19-OPS-DIS-03/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domestic capacity is being reduced</a> 60-70% in April and 70-80% in May. International capacity is being reduced 80-90% for those two months. </li>
        <li>Service to Asia has been suspended, except for three flights per week from Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) to Tokyo (NRT). </li>
        <li>Service to Australia is completely suspended. </li>

American Airlines will continue to offer one daily flight to London (LHR) from DFW and MIA, respectively.</li>
        <li>Service to many South American airports has also been halted. </li>

       <p>You should also read up on your airline's general rebooking and cancellation policies. For example, Southwest allows <a class="PlU" href="https://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/purchasing-and-refunds/refund-info-pol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customers to cancel any flight</a> up to 10 minutes before departure and use those funds towards another trip. This policy existed before the coronavirus outbreak. </p>
       <h2>Coronavirus Travel Notices From The CDC</h2>
       <p>The CDC offers a <a class="PlU" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpful breakdown of travel notices</a>, ranking the risk level (on a scale of one to three) for traveling to a given country. Right now, it recommends that people avoid <em>all</em> nonessential international travel because of "widespread, ongoing transmission" of the coronavirus. The CDC has also placed a warning level 3 notice on <a class="PlU" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-cruise-ship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cruise travel worldwide</a>.</p>

       <h2>Can You Fly Within The U.S. During The Coronavirus Outbreak?</h2>
       <p>Yes, you can still fly within the U.S., however, you might see drastically fewer options for domestic flights in the weeks to come. </p>
       <p>In the beginning of March, United became the first airline to <a class="PlU" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/business/united-us-flight-cuts-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cut its U.S. domestic flight schedule</a> by 10%, citing a drop in demand from passengers because of coronavirus. Then, on March 14, American Airlines announced <a class="PlU" href="http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-Announces-Additional-Schedule-Changes-in-Response-to-Customer-Demand-Related-to-Covid-19-031220-OPS-DIS-03/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">significant schedule cuts,</a> including "a 75% reduction in international capacity." </p>

       </div>
       <p>With that said, the situation with the coronavirus in any country can change rapidly. You'll want to keep <a class="PlU" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/where-to-get-coronavirus-updates-stay-informed-22419348">up to date on the state of coronavirus</a> in any American city that you plan to visit, and then plan accordingly.</p>
       <h2>Should Immunocompromised, Elderly, Or Pregnant People Fly During The Coronavirus Outbreak?</h2>
       <p>Pregnant women do not appear to be <a class="PlU" href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/coronavirus-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more susceptible to coronavirus</a>, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and there isn't proof that the virus can be passed to the fetus. Still, Daniel Roshan, director of Rosh Maternal &amp; Fetal Medicine in New York City, told the <em>Washington Post </em>that he thinks <a class="PlU" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/advice-for-pregnant-women-older-people-and-others-about-travel-during-coronavirus-outbreak/2020/03/07/aeba950a-5fdd-11ea-b014-4fafa866bb81_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pregnant women should avoid flying</a> if they can help it. </p>
       <p>On the other hand, the CDC reports that older adults and those with "serious chronic medical conditions" (like heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease) are at a higher <a class="PlU" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#avoid-crowds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">risk of getting "very sick" from coronavirus</a> compared to the general population. As a result, it recommends they avoid "all non-essential travel" for the time being, including plane trips and traveling on cruise ships. </p>
       <h2>Should You Buy Travel Insurance Because Of Coronavirus?</h2>
       <p>Many large travel insurance companies have expanded their claims offerings amid the coronavirus pandemic, while others have cut coronavirus-related claims entirely. So the key is to read the fine print.</p>
       <p>For Allianz Travel Insurance, for example, you can now file a <a class="PlU" href="https://www.allianztravelinsurance.com/coverage-alerts/2019-novel-coronavirus.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus-related travel claim</a> for the following reasons:</p>
       <p><em>1. Under Emergency Medical Care and Emergency Medical Transportation Benefits: Emergency medical care for a customer who becomes ill with COVID-19 while on their trip. </em></p>
       <p><em>2. Under Trip Cancellation or Trip Interruption Benefits: Trip cancellation and trip interruption if a customer becomes ill with COVID-19 either before or during their trip. </em></p>
       <div class="ZTj">

         </blockquote>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>With that said, many other travel insurers have released statements making it clear that they do not cover coronavirus-related claims, including <a class="PlU" href="https://www.aviva.co.uk/insurance/travel/coronavirus-advice-travel-insurance-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aviva</a>,<a class="PlU" href="https://www.insureandgo.com/help/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> InsureandGo</a>, <a class="PlU" href="https://www.postoffice.co.uk/travel/travel-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post Office</a>, and<a class="PlU" href="https://www.lv.com/travel-insurance/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> LV.</a> In a statement on its website, LV said that it was pausing the sale of travel insurance, explaining in part, "In light of the impact that Coronavirus (COVID-19) is having globally, we’ve made the difficult decision to pause the sale of travel insurance to new customers." Anyone who has already purchased travel insurance from LV will have that insurance honored, the company confirmed. </p>
       <p>It's worth remembering that most airlines are offering affected ticket holders the <a class="PlU" href="https://news.delta.com/delta-temporarily-suspend-all-us-china-flying" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">option to rebook their flights</a> for a later date, or even to receive a refund in the form of travel credit. Of course, a lot of these travel waivers are dependent on specific dates, regarding when you purchased your ticket, and when you planned to fly. </p>
       <h2>If You Do Book A Flight Right Now, Will It Be Cheaper?</h2>
       <p>Yes, it's possible that you might be able to book cheaper domestic or international flights during the coronavirus outbreak — but that doesn't mean it's a good idea.</p>
       <p>Even if you're super healthy, or in a low-risk age demographic for COVID-9, <a class="PlU" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social distancing </a>is one of the most effective ways to contain the spread of coronavirus, the CDC reports. And you can't really practice social distancing when you fly. In other words, <a class="PlU" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/03/07/with-covid-19-coronavirus-should-you-cancel-or-postpone-air-travel/#5e0259a71c73" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when you travel,</a> you're carrying germs along with you everywhere you go. So if you fly somewhere, get infected with the virus, and come home, you could pass that virus along to countless others along the way, even if you exhibit no symptoms at all. </p>
       <h2><strong>Will You Be Quarantined If You Travel During The Coronavirus Outbreak?</strong></h2>
       <p><a class="PlU" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/trump-travel-ban-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. travel restrictions on Europe</a> only apply to non-U.S. citizens who have been in those nations in the past two weeks, <em>The New York Times </em>reports. A full list of who is and isn't allowed to enter the country, starting on Friday, can be found in this<a class="PlU" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspension-entry-immigrants-nonimmigrants-certain-additional-persons-pose-risk-transmitting-2019-novel-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> White House press release.</a></p>
       <p>During an appearance on <em>Fox and Friends </em>on March 12, Vice President Mike Pence said that any <a class="PlU" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcwCz77_be0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans returning to the U.S.</a> from those 26 European countries in the next 30 days will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days, and enter the U.S. through one of 13 airports that have appropriate screenings set up. American Airlines provided a <a class="PlU" href="http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/Government-Imposed-Travel-Restrictions-OPS-DIS-03/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of approved airports</a> where travelers from China have been screened:</p>

       <h2>How To Disinfect Your Plane Seat Area During The Coronavirus Outbreak</h2>
       <p>If you have to <a class="PlU" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/airplane-flying-coronavirus-spread.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fly during the coronavirus outbreak</a>, there are a few ways you can keep yourself as healthy as possible while you travel. According to <em>The New York Times,</em> you can clean your area with a disinfectant wipe, making sure to wipe down all of the hard surfaces around you. This includes the remote, screen, seatbelt buckle, seat tray, and seat pocket. </p>
       <p>As for any leather or porous surfaces, like your actual seat, try not to wipe them down with wet wipes, because that can spread germs rather than kill them, <em>The New York Times </em>reports. </p>
       <h2><strong>Airline Cleaning Protocols In Response To Coronavirus</strong></h2>
       <p>Ultimately, there's some reason to believe planes could be all around cleaner than they were before COVID-19 started spreading. “When I worked this weekend, everyone had a package of wet wipes and was wiping everything down,” one Atlanta-based flight attendant told Bustle for an earlier story. “This is probably <a class="PlU" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/flight-attendants-explain-how-coronavirus-is-impacting-their-work-22617934">the cleanest the plane has ever been.”</a></p>
       <p>Separately, some airlines have ramped up their cleaning protocols during the coronavirus outbreak. Delta has recently announced a <a class="PlU" href="https://news.delta.com/aircraft-fogging?utm_source=Delta+News+Hub+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=18e4808647-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_10_05_35&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_be3f884155-18e4808647-158066441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"fogging procedure,"</a> for example. In a statement, the airline explained that the process “disinfects surface areas that we all touch in the aircraft."</p>
       <blockquote class="Xml">
        "The procedure uses a safe, high-grade EPA-registered disinfectant that is highly effective against many communicable diseases, including coronaviruses. Following the fogging procedure, cleaning crews thoroughly clean cabin surfaces including tray tables, seatback screens, and lavatories.”
       </blockquote>
       <p>Similarly, Southwest has implemented a new <a class="PlU" href="https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-f567b8716930c9084bbc00f22c5270ec-southwest-implements-enhanced-aircraft-cleaning-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"enhanced aircraft cleaning program,"</a> with the addition of a HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter. Per a press release, HEPA filters "filter out recirculated air onboard each plane to remove airborne particles." However, BuzzFeed News pointed out that <a class="PlU" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/dont-buy-an-air-purifier-to-protect-from-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronavirus particles are too small to be filtered</a> out of the air. </p>
       <h2>Other Ways To Protect Yourself From Coronavirus While Flying</h2>
       <p>There are a few standard strategies you can take to keep yourself as safe from germs as possible while you travel. </p>
       <p>"People should take the same measures [for the coronavirus] that they do for the flu or any other virus," explains <a class="PlU" href="https://www.maimonidesmed.org/find-a-doctor/find-a-doctor/janine-kelly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Janine Kelly</a>, M.D., an attending physician at <a class="PlU" href="https://www.maimonidesmed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maimonides Medical Center</a> in Brooklyn, New York. She offers a few tips and tricks: "Don’t touch surfaces that someone who has sick has touched. <a class="PlU" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-does-coronavirus-spread-respiratory-droplets-could-be-a-key-culprit-21754208">Wash your hands regularly</a> and use sanitizer. Avoid contact with people who are sneezing and coughing." </p>
       <p>And if you thought turning on your air inside the cabin was a bad idea, think again. “I know there has always been this myth that the <a class="PlU" href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/air-quality-during-your-flight-54164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air in the cabin recirculates</a>, but that’s not actually true," a flight attendant told Bustle. "The air inside the cabin is filtered and comes from the outside. When you’re onboard, you’re not breathing in the same air over and over again at all.”</p>
       <div class="ZTj">
        <div class="XeQ">
         <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-tweetid="1229858124766408704">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1229858124766408704"></a>
         </blockquote>
        </div>
       </div>
       <p>You can also deploy some basic sanitation strategies, like making sure you're using hand sanitizers with at least <a class="PlU" href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60% alcohol</a>, as the CDC suggests<em>,</em> and<a class="PlU" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-do-tiktoks-coronavirus-hand-washing-challenge-22606497"> washing your hands</a> for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water. </p>
       <p>Dr. <a class="PlU" href="https://online.maryville.edu/nursing-degrees/faculty/mariea-snell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariea Snell</a>, M.D., assistant director of the <a class="PlU" href="https://online.maryville.edu/online-doctorate-degrees/doctor-nursing-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Doctor of Nursing Practice Program</a> at Maryville University, tells Bustle that disinfectant wipes can also come in handy. As of March 20, the <a class="PlU" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC does not recommend</a> that Americans <a class="PlU" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/do-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-it-doesnt-mean-everyone-needs-one-21759945">wear face masks</a>, unless they are infected or caring for<strong> </strong>someone who is infected.</p>
       <p>Ultimately, while traveling can increase the odds of your getting sick in general, it doesn't necessarily mean there's cause for alarm. "It is important to be safe but it's also important to not panic," Dr. Snell says. </p>
       <p>Travel and health circumstances can change quickly with an outbreak. Consider following the <a class="PlU" href="https://twitter.com/CDCgov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC</a> and the <a class="PlU" href="https://twitter.com/WHO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WHO</a> on social media to stay up to date on the situation, especially if you have a trip planned. </p>
