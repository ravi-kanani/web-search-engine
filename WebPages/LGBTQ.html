Jamil, for her part, responded by coming out as queer on Twitter and the discourse shifted. In addition to addressing valid questions about Jamil’s qualifications to judge house-ballroom, some claimed that Jamil was not really queer — or that she wasn't somehow “queer enough.” \nIt was an online mess that, while not entirely new, reopened old wounds within the queer community and resurfaced anxieties many, including myself, already felt. How queer do you have to be to be “queer enough” for your community? And who gets to decide? And why do such exclusionary ideas fester in a community known for tolerance, anyway?\n✌🏽 pic.twitter.com/YcB6H7YCT0— Jameela Jamil 🌈 (@jameelajamil) February 5, 2020\n\nIs “queer” the new word for “completely heterosexual”?— Goody⚡️Ravenclaw (@GoodyCorvid) February 6, 2020\n\nOops...! pic.twitter.com/1WzK5fRYks— Denise Marie (@Denise001212) February 6, 2020\n\nJamil later said that she had chosen the “most inappropriate time” to come out, but the damage had been done. (There have also been recent rumors about her lying about her illnesses and having Munchausen's — but that’s a whole other controversy.) The internet had become a flurry of discussion about who can judge ballroom and, more insidiously, a discussion of who is and is not queer enough. \nI know this debate well, but it had previously existed for me mostly internally. I am bisexual and have dated both men and women, but I still struggle with wondering whether I am queer enough for the LGBTQ community, given my appearance (“straight-passing”) and the fact that I am not monosexually gay. \nOther queer people have the same anxiety I do and it may be more common than I thought.\nI knew, logically, that I was not alone, but I’ve rarely voiced these concerns for fear of the backlash; that people would say I must be straight or else I wouldn't have such fears. \nThe criticism that sparked Jamil’s coming out ignited a public conversation that solidified my anxiety. It also revealed another truth: Other queer people have the same anxiety I do, and it may be more common than I thought.\n“The situation and its media coverage has honestly inspired a lot of feelings in me,” said Mary, a bisexual 25-year-old I spoke to, who asked to go by first name only for privacy reasons. Mary described herself as “semi-closeted,” and she said that people saying Jamil needed to categorize herself made her uneasy. “It’s hard for me to see this in a clear-cut way because I am unsettled by the unsatisfied masses who seemingly want her to apply a label to herself.”\nMary’s friends and her fiancé know she is bisexual, but her family does not. “It’s hard to watch someone who is in the public eye be boxed into a corner to apply a specific term to herself ... because I worry the same would happen to me if I outed myself to my family,” Mary said. “Seeing that kind of pushback with Jameela makes me antsy; I think it could happen to me too. Or anyone.”\nA bi woman I spoke to — who wished to remain anonymous for privacy reasons — was alarmed by the charges of Jamil not being queer enough. “It has been shocking to see how much this has brought people to explicitly say being bisexual doesn’t make you queer enough,” she told me over Twitter DM. \nGiven the pervasiveness of this anxiety, and the discord it sows within the queer community, I set out to uncover where it came from — and what we can do about it.\n\nDressing “queer” versus straight-passing\nAppearance has a lot to do with this. This is because every group — even countercultural ones — has its own set of norms members may feel pressured to adhere to. “Social psychology predicts that, once a queer person joins a group of peers, that person will experience a pressure to conform to the group's norms,” said Pavel Blagov, associate professor of psychology at Whitman College.\nThere is a “queer aesthetic” that if people, especially women, do not fit into, they may pass as straight. This manifests in fashion choices, makeup use (or lack thereof), and hair. When I cut my hair last month, for example, one of my friends fawned over my fresh “bisexual bob.” It goes without saying that a queer person does not need to “look queer” to be queer — and yet, assumptions pervade in queer culture just as they do among straight people.\nJamil fits well within the “femme” queer categorization: she has long hair, wears dresses and heels, and uses makeup. Passing as straight may afford a bisexual person privileges such as employment opportunities and familial support, but the rug could be pulled out from a bisexual person at a moment’s notice. \nAccording to Kathryn Hobson, an assistant professor of communications studies at James Madison University who has written about and researched femininity and queer identity, femininity is often devalued in queer communities. While she thinks the queer community’s opinion toward femininity is changing within younger generations, Hobson said she has felt that resistance herself as a bi femme. \n“Is it a privilege if you have to come out all the time over and over and over?”\nHobson pushed back at the concept that queer femmes are privileged. “Is it a privilege if you have to come out all the time over and over and over?” she asked. “It doesn't feel like it when you're living that as your everyday experience.” \nI relate to this, having had to, say, come out on a first date with a man if I mention a story about an ex who happens to be a woman. If the choice is between using the wrong pronoun to describe my ex or to come out, I come out even if I was not initially prepared to do so. \nAs Shiri Eisner details in Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution, passing comes at a price. It can mean being in a constant state of worry about being “found out.” It means not only hiding a part of oneself, but hiding past experiences and relationships (with the same gender if passing as straight, and with different genders if passing as gay). \nThis can lead to mental health problems. Bi people do experience a greater likelihood of depression and other mood and anxiety disorders than the broader population, according to the San Francisco Human Rights Commission. It can also lead to punishment should a passing person’s bisexuality be “discovered.” \n“Access to ‘heterosexual privilege,’” wrote Eisner, “... stops at the moment when their heterosexuality is ‘proven otherwise.’” \nQueerness is, of course, not a look but a set of attractions, desires, and behaviors. Even then, however, behavior gets scrutinized — such as how many queer relationships or sexual experiences one has had versus those with someone of a different gender. \nSEE ALSO: Queers Against Pete highlights the LGBTQ community's frustration with Buttigieg\n“Behavior gets judged, too,” Hobson said. “If you're a woman, [you get asked] ‘how many women have you slept with?’ Or, ‘how many queer people have you slept with? Or how much queer sex have you had?'” Bisexual and non-gay queer people feel this pressure to prove themselves, not just in appearance but in their past and experiences. This is despite the fact that actions do not necessarily prove orientation, just as much as appearance doesn’t. \n“In queer communities, I think there's a tendency to try to put people into either a hetero or homo box,” said Hobson. \nBut why? Many queer people live outside binaries that some in straight culture do not understand. And most, if not all, queer folks can relate to feeling othered in heterosexual society at some point in their lives, if not every waking moment. So why do some queer people make fellow queers feel “other,” as they did with Jameela Jamil?\nBiphobia in the queer community\nIn Bi, Eisner writes that that biphobia within gay and lesbian circles is discussed so much because bisexual people come out to those communities seeking acceptance — and sometimes experience the same erasure, exclusion, and biphobia they do in the straight community instead. “This experience is particularly painful,” Eisner writes. “This rejection seems to come from where we least expect it — where we came for support.” \nThis is due both to the psychological and evolutionary causes of prejudice in general, though there are also specific underpinnings for biphobia, according to Blagov. Our brains have evolved to make sense of the world around us by utilizing categories. This can lead to an “us vs. them” mentality, even unconsciously.\n\nCriticism of Jameela is valid and I agree with a lot of it, but damn, is saying that this is why Bi/pan people aren’t “queer enough” or aren’t trusted by the rest of the community really necessary?— Camryn Garrett (@dancingofpens) February 6, 2020\n\nHobson, too, acknowledged the cognitive reason behind this. “No matter what, people want to have some sort of way to categorize people — it's just easier,” she said. Our minds use stereotypes as a kind of “shortcut”; it is part of how our brains are wired. That means queer people aren't immune from stereotyping those in their own community. While it may be due to biology, stereotyping is not okay and can be unlearned — especially with the breadth of online and offline resources by organizations such as GLAAD and The Trevor Project.\nBut it is important to recognize biphobia as a prejudice completely separate from homophobia. “The psychological literature on biphobia does point to at least a couple of specific sources of prejudice against sexual minority individuals and, specifically, bisexual persons,” said Blagov. \nThese reasons include stigmatization about HIV (a straight woman may be biphobic towards a bisexual man, for example, because she believes he might contract HIV from a man); stereotypes about promiscuity and relationship instability; and threats to social power. \nIn terms of the latter and the “us vs. them” mentality, both straight and gay people may see bisexuals as having one foot in the “us” category and one foot in “them” — thus making them some sort of betrayer, or threat to power in the straight or gay community. \nThe feeling is not unique to bisexuals\nOf course, it’s not only bi people who experience feeling not “queer enough” — and it’s not only tied to sexual orientation. \nWriter Cass Marshall is a non-binary queer person married to a cis man, who says they “fly under the radar” by appearing to be a straight woman. “It's a misconception I never want to correct, making me feel semi-closeted, because the idea of announcing these things that aren't necessarily visible is hard,” Marshall told me. \nSEE ALSO: 'They' is the word of the decade\nMarshall found the discussion about Jamil frustrating, and related to her at that moment. “There are times I've had colleagues or peers kind of throw an elbow at me, saying that they wished a queer or trans writer had a perspective on something I wrote about,” they said. “It feels suffocating; I don't want to have to publicly state a part of my identity I'm grappling with in order to win an argument, but it also hurts to just nod and let the assumption that I'm cis and het roll by.”\nOther people I spoke to felt similarly. “It’s a weird balance because the celebration of unique queer cultures is so important and I don’t want to elevate my experience as a white cis straight passing bisexual as the most important. It’s not,” the person who wished to remain anonymous said. “But it’s part of the story.”\nIt does feel like a lose-lose: acknowledging what passing may afford you, but hiding part of your identity as a result. \nBlagov believes feeling “not queer enough” has both intrapersonal and interpersonal roots. Queer people — like everyone — question whether they belong in their group and wonder how to/how much to adapt to the group’s culture. “Becoming and being queer is a process,” said Blagov, “not a static state of affairs.” \n“Becoming and being queer is a process, not a static state of affairs.” \nThose who do not feel “queer enough” may be impacted by messages they receive from their peers or the media. Hobson agreed, stating that judgment by the queer community and outside it creates an anxiety for non-gay queer folks. \nThe queer community has its own set of norms that have to do with both looks and notches on bedposts. Those benchmarks are not only fraudulent but harmful. And they can result in internal trauma (questioning oneself, truly believing you are not queer enough) and outer trauma (violence and isolation, as detailed by Eisner in Bi and other writings on biphobia). \nIt is a mindfuck to think about how a community formed from not fitting society’s heterosexual norm can have its own norms, but it’s true. Those norms may change as time goes on, but norms will always be a part of any culture. Queer folks need to realize that, and also realize it is OK not to fit within them. \n“There is not a ‘right’ way to be queer,” Blagov confirmed. “Queer people's experience, expression, and degree of emotional investment in their queer identity differs from person to person and over time.”\nI did not become “more” bisexual when I cut my hair. I do not become “more” bisexual when I am dating a woman versus “less” bisexual when I date a man. And while the “queer enough” anxiety persists, talking about it helps not only bring it to light, but helps us realize there is no such thing — for me, for Jamil, for any of us. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1220854%252F8bf9d953-ea24-4390-b1e2-c3f923d72112.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Yo49Boh1pZ4drt6AbiTY907hl5o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=redn99roiy8gN_S8uvRNCoje108=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F800x360.png?signature=DhXHaT2X3Yt6O1tfBT8hk9rnO24=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F1600x720.png?signature=-NzXKHr4aN8i1teWizIY_KAGRgQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Jameela Jamil, bisexuality, and the anxiety of not feeling 'queer enough'","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F800x360.png?signature=DhXHaT2X3Yt6O1tfBT8hk9rnO24=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.webp%252F800x360.webp?signature=Y0McLzMJFRI8bwHEZljOsQUxEWw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","naturalWidth":"800","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F800x360.png?signature=DhXHaT2X3Yt6O1tfBT8hk9rnO24=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","sizes":"800w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Jameela Jamil, bisexuality, and the anxiety of not feeling 'queer enough'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"O4oKAOwmnd","data-ytid":"g0OtMMy-EJ8","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"If you're queer and have ever felt not \"queer enough,\" you're not alone.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Jameela Jamil, bisexuality, and the anxiety of not feeling 'queer enough'"}

For some members of the queer community, however, his campaign is frustrating — especially as he emerges as the centrist pick, having come in second behind Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire primary. His moderate policies, billionaire donors, and the way he's distanced himself from the community (last September he said he stopped reading LGBTQ media) are a few issues cited by his critics.\nThis is not a new revelation, but now that primary voting has begun its impacts are starting to show. Buttigieg came in third with queer Iowans who voted in the caucus, according to New York Times reporting. (They were more likely to vote for Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.) Since Buttigieg’s campaign took off last year, queer people have spoken against the candidate due to the fact that, as BuzzFeed News reporter Shannon Keating wrote in November, he represents “everything the marriage-focused mainstream gay rights movement has failed to deliver.” \nSEE ALSO: Pete Buttigieg's confusing 'shape of our democracy' quote is inspiring memes\n“Marriage equality is not justice or equality for the most marginalized of our community,” Jes Scheinpflug, a community organizer based in Chicago, told Mashable. “He [Buttigieg] talks about marriage equality as if it’s the greatest thing, and it leaves behind so many people.”\nThis is a sentiment that reverberates throughout the progressive queer community: Buttigieg represents respectability and whitewashed politics. For some members of said community — particularly those who are rich, white, and cis — the fight for equality may have ended when same-sex marriage became legal in 2015.\nFor others, however, there are many issues yet to be addressed. For example, LGBTQ voters listed violence against transgender people as the top concern that the community faces in the country, according to an Out magazine and YouGov survey released last November. The issue in second place was workplace discrimination; in 26 states, employees can still be fired for being gay.\nNow, as primary season is underway, some queer voters are pushing back against Buttigieg harder than ever. One collective, called Queers Against Pete, has a mission of doing just that. Queers Against Pete was born out of frustration over Buttigieg’s policies, like his lack of support of free college, and his actions as South Bend mayor, such as how he handled the shooting of black resident Eric Logan by a white police officer. \n“Marriage equality is not justice or equality for the most marginalized of our community.”\nQueers Against Pete organizer Gregory A. Cendana told Mashable he was inspired to get involved in a more active way after seeing Black Lives Matter - South Bend protest Buttigieg in Iowa. “It’s important for us to center black communities,” Cendana said, “Especially because black trans women are disproportionately impacted within the broader LGBTQIA community.”\nCendana said Queers Against Pete wants to push candidates, like Buttigieg, on issues that could be potentially harmful to their communities.\nQueers Against Pete has “been truly grassroots, organic folks all just connecting through our organizer networks,” said Scheinpflug, who was pulled into Queers Against Pete when someone emailed them about shutting Buttigieg down in Chicago.\nIndeed, Queers Against Pete’s first intervention was at Buttigieg’s fundraising event in Chicago shortly before the Iowa caucus. Cendana asked Buttigieg about how a queer teen who has been disowned by their parents would pay for college without universal free college. Scheinpflug asked about Eric Logan. At the end of Buttigieg’s remarks, they chanted “Queers against Pete.”\nNow, the group encourages people who share their sentiment to sign an open letter. “We cannot in good conscience allow Mayor Pete to become the nominee without demanding that he address the needs and concerns of the broader [LGBTQIA] communities,” the letter states. It goes on to detail Buttigieg’s policies the grassroots organization do not support:\n\nQueers Against Pete released a joint press release about the letter with Queers Not Here For Mayor Pete, a group with a similar message. The letter has more than 3,000 signatures thus far and according to Cendana, has representation in all 50 states and DC. \nThe collective has gotten backlash over why they will not support the one openly gay person in the race. To that, Cendana said that identity is only one aspect of a candidate. \n“We have to look at all parts and make informed decisions on all parts, and not focus solely on a particular identity,” he said. “Especially if some of those policies or things folks are pushing for may actually be harmful.”\nCendana believes it’s his duty and the duty of the broader queer community to push candidates, especially Buttigieg, to be responsible and accountable. He wants Buttigieg to hear their concerns and shift his policies to reflect the broader community.\nSEE ALSO: Nevada caucus will use new 'iPad tool' they swear isn't an app and things don't sound great\nScheinpflug echoed Cendana’s concerns about Buttigieg and his commitment to helping all LGBTQ people. “Just because someone’s gay doesn’t mean they’re progressive,” they said. “And it doesn’t mean they care about everyone in the community.” They compared their stance on Buttigieg to that about Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is a black lesbian and has received backlash from the queer community due to her policies. \nCendana compared his feelings on Buttigieg to his feelings on Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard (this interview occurred the day before the New Hampshire primary, where Yang dropped out of the race).  “As a Filipino American and as an Asian American, people are like, ‘What about Andrew Yang? What about Tulsi Gabbard or some of the other Asian American Pacific Islander candidates up and down the ballot?’” \n“In the same way I feel about Mayor Pete and him being gay is the same response I give to Andrew Yang and him being Asian American,” he said. “Just because someone shares a particular identity doesn’t necessarily mean they share values, they share commitment.” \nQueers Against Pete has not endorsed any particular candidate. On the groups’s FAQ page, they state that members support different candidates, some not at all. According to Scheinpflug, the collective has gotten criticized by saying who they’re against and not who they’re for, but they do not think those criticisms hold. \n“I think they don't have the big picture view of what this tactic is,” Scheinpflug said. In their work in local Chicago politics, Scheinpflug has seen the tactic work with initiatives such as No More Joe Moore, which rallied against the incumbent alderman for the 49th ward but did not endorse his competitor, Maria Hadden. Moore was voted out of office. \n“This is a broader call to folks that we care, we matter about who is trying to represent us” \nAs of now, the open letter is Queers Against Pete’s biggest priority. Cendana hopes that as Queers Against Pete’s message spreads and more people become interested, that the group will organize more events. “This is a broader call to folks that we care, we matter about who is trying to represent us, and we’re going to do our due diligence to do what we can to ensure that the most vulnerable in our community are centered and lifted up,” he said.\nScheinpflug wants a candidate who will listen — and they believe Buttigieg has not thus far.\n“There’s video after video of people asking him a question and him ignoring them, especially if they’re not people who paid a lot of money to get into his fundraiser,” they said. Queers Against Pete’s own exchange with Buttigieg in Chicago was caught on video. “He doesn’t want to listen to us. He's literally going out of his way to not listen to us.” \nScheinpflug said that no matter whom the country elects, they and the broader community will disagree, but what’s imperative is having a candidate who will listen. \n“We don't have to agree on everything, but they have to be willing to have those conversations that try to see our side,” they said. “And he's just not even willing to do that.”"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1199745%252F40001516-5395-489c-8c0a-385a9008dde3.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=5nQWNUZ4lpdxzuzwscItkNZK_h0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=osEqwkui2TO_BxDF3F3zDGmJvNk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=dFDmAJhevlJpOQT3k0_GSSGngic=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=TaGRqcdo4A6FgPhUfzpJZDRxrKE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Queers Against Pete highlights the LGBTQ community's frustration with Buttigieg","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=dFDmAJhevlJpOQT3k0_GSSGngic=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=yGwdtbxVRcyxreEpiyU4dyuhfpA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=dFDmAJhevlJpOQT3k0_GSSGngic=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Queers Against Pete highlights the LGBTQ community's frustration with Buttigieg","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"“He doesn’t want to listen to us.

The Unicode Consortium, a non-profit that standardizes languages across digital platforms and devices, on Wednesday announced an upcoming launch of 62 new emoji. Among them are a transgender flag, emoji of 55 gender and skin-tone variants, a polar bear, a teapot, and a ... piñata?\n\nOver the past few years, the Unicode Consortium has been working on integrating more diverse, inclusive emoji — a response to criticisms about how it has been slow to address its lack of diversity. This new collection of emoji hints at their continued effort toward making emoji more inclusive, even in the subtle ways in which they represent different cultures.\nBoba, which is often associated with Asian American culture, is one way of doing that— as is the transgender flag emoji.\n\"For trans folk being able to say 'transgender' in emoji and to be out and proud and let our allies visibly support us is a huge deal for our community,\" Tea Uglow, who helped co-author the proposal for the emoji, said. \"We’re really happy to have finally crossed into mainstream culture. It’s been an amazing team effort around the world.” \nNew emoji typically start rolling onto devices starting September; other platforms release them earlier. Until then, you can think up creative ways to use these new emoji."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1175938%252F70b4823a-ec03-4eb8-863d-25f99b4f726e.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=-C0uFzsZwp2DkbrMPbRxLPv3SXc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110001%252F11ea766d-7c65-4f09-8891-43a3238472d1.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=rc7R7MgCth1Wo4pWnY-cb-IQZXA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110001%252F11ea766d-7c65-4f09-8891-43a3238472d1.png%252F280x158.png?signature=Xrx2RJp4VazvFTPO1nyaN-15Ias=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110001%252F11ea766d-7c65-4f09-8891-43a3238472d1.png%252F560x316.png?signature=4jvzbi-ptoXlD2VkFavscWjf3X0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"At long last, there's a bubble tea emoji","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110001%252F11ea766d-7c65-4f09-8891-43a3238472d1.png%252F280x158.png?signature=Xrx2RJp4VazvFTPO1nyaN-15Ias=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110001%252F11ea766d-7c65-4f09-8891-43a3238472d1.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=ma-Zt60FCvtimwkdIP3LykeidFs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110001%252F11ea766d-7c65-4f09-8891-43a3238472d1.png%252F280x158.png?signature=Xrx2RJp4VazvFTPO1nyaN-15Ias=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"At long last, there's a bubble tea emoji","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"And a transgender flag emoji (!!)","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"At long last, there's a bubble tea emoji"},{"_id":"5e2b6c4128cc3611d200001b","id":"/article/san-francisco-pride-google-ban-not-binding/","title":"San Francisco Pride's ban on Google, YouTube gets noped by the lawyers","title_tag":null,"author":"Natasha Piñon","post_date":"2020-01-24T22:14:19+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 22:14:19 +0000","formatted_date":"01/24/2020","sort_key":"1IV7dx","link":"https://mashable.com/article/san-francisco-pride-google-ban-not-binding/","content":{"plain":"The San Francisco Pride (SF Pride) legal team has determined that a vote last week to remove Google and YouTube as sponsors and participants in future SF Pride celebrations was not legally binding, per an emailed statement from the organization's leader received by Mashable. (According to a Google spokesperson, the company has sponsored SF Pride celebrations for over a decade.) \nThe previously announced resolution cited what \"some voting members of the organization perceived to be inadequate protection from homophobia, racism, and harassment on Google's platforms, particularly YouTube,\" as formerly reported at Mashable.\nPer our earlier reporting and a new statement from SF Pride, the Jan. 15 meeting at which the resolution was passed only had around a dozen of SF Pride's 326 members present for the vote. Of those present, seven voted for the ban. \nIn an emailed statement to Mashable, Carolyn Wysinger, the president of San Francisco Pride, explained the legal team's reasoning behind its decision. \n\"This small group is not representative of the larger Pride community, and our lawyers determined it is not reasonable for them to make motions at a meeting which doesn’t have enough people to equal a quorum and expect that vote to be a binding measure for the Board of Directors,\" Wysinger said. \"Our Board of Directors was elected to represent our members and the community as a whole. They have a fiduciary responsibility to advocate for an inclusive, successful, and safe celebration each year.\"\nAs noted in our previous reporting, the authors of the initial statement announcing the vote noted that though they did not know if the resolution would be legally binding without board approval, it was possible that the board of directors might pass the motions. They wrote that \"there seems to be broad agreement that motions like these passed by both membership and board votes would be binding.\"\nWe've reached out to the authors of the statement and will update as we hear back. \nNow, Wysinger explained, the board will meet on Feb. 5 to discuss the next steps concerning the proposed ban and its implications for SF Pride. \nWhen asked about Google and YouTube's sponsorship of the 2020 parade, Wysinger wrote to Mashable: \"We are in the process of lining up sponsors for our 2020 parade. We expect to have our sponsors set in the coming months.\" \nSF Pride has acknowledged the importance of sponsors and partners in the past. Last year, the organization reported that the cost to produce its annual event had exceeded $3 million. Despite an earlier push to ban Google from sponsoring and participating in pride last year, referenced in our earlier reporting, Google was confirmed as a sponsor in 2019, and is still listed as a sponsor of the 2019 SF Pride parade, according to its website. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1168631%252Fd990ab68-c901-45f5-a23c-b6fa3919ae6a.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=FHAGtAO71pZWZjwGWZltc1RTm4Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109785%252Fc34a32d8-97c1-4f78-ac88-341a3b89b627.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=H4cUZZ3u0h5kMV2U6tAIoZs5rjs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109785%252Fc34a32d8-97c1-4f78-ac88-341a3b89b627.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=OAVWL_fDpv-BqUGz4sKs1Q7vNWM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109785%252Fc34a32d8-97c1-4f78-ac88-341a3b89b627.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=zKbRuY_cpStNmPCIr-U6ByzIHMQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"San Francisco Pride's ban on Google, YouTube gets noped by the lawyers","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109785%252Fc34a32d8-97c1-4f78-ac88-341a3b89b627.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=OAVWL_fDpv-BqUGz4sKs1Q7vNWM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109785%252Fc34a32d8-97c1-4f78-ac88-341a3b89b627.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=EDCGrBm5LY2eEdB7qnrKF7cpKTw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109785%252Fc34a32d8-97c1-4f78-ac88-341a3b89b627.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=OAVWL_fDpv-BqUGz4sKs1Q7vNWM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"San Francisco Pride's ban on Google, YouTube gets noped by the lawyers","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"They cite the number of members present for the vote.

Life is short. And I have more questions then answers, but one thing I’m sure of is that we came here to love. And if the people I’ve loved means I am “queer” or “bi” or whatever they call it, then I am proud of that. Because I am never going to walk away from an opportunity to love when it’s rare light shines through in a world that is quick to judge and forget. I may be LGBTQ, but that’s just one detail on the list of things that make me Rachel. I hope by sharing this with you, you can believe that it’s okay to accept every way you love in this world. Your love is a gift here, and so are you. The world might not understand, but they don’t need to. Because I am my own why.

We believe companies should earn that opportunity by proving that they really do stand with our community,\" read a statement given to the SFGATE about the decision from Laurence Berland and Tyler Breisacher, two SF Pride members. Berland, now one of the members helming the current efforts to ban Google, is also a former Google employee. \nIn the face of mounting techlash, it might seem like fairly standard fare. But it gets more complicated.\nAt the Jan. 15 meeting in which the resolution was passed, only around a dozen of SF Pride's over 300 members were present for the vote, Fred Lopez, the organization's interim executive director, told Recode. Of the dozen or so members present, seven voted in favor of the recommended ban.\nNow, the resolution awaits consideration from the organization's board. While it remains to be seen if the resolutions are legally binding without board approval, it is possible the board of directors might pass the motions, according to Berland and Breisacher's statement about the decision. If that's the case, the statement notes that \"there seems to be broad agreement that motions like these passed by both membership and board votes would be binding.\"\nMashable reached out to Berland and Breisacher via Twitter for a response and will update when we receive comments. \nLopez wrote in a statement to Mashable: \"One small group raised concerns about Google as a corporate sponsor ... As we get ready to celebrate our 50th parade, our goal remains the same as it was for our first — to be inclusive and reflect the diversity of our communities.\" \nHe told Mashable that SF Pride's legal team expects an update about the legal implications of the vote by the end of this week. Lopez also notes that the organization's board of directors will meet on Feb. 5 to determine its next steps. \nAlongside several other former Google employees, Berland has alleged that the company terminated employment of employees, including himself, for workplace organizing, according to Vox. (Google said instead that the employees violated data security and code of conduct policies.) \nSEE ALSO: YouTube's top related videos have a climate change denial problem\nThe push to drop Google from sponsoring and participating in SF Pride started over six months ago, in anticipation of 2019's pride parade. That was spurred by policies regarding harassment and hate speech directed at LGBTQ+ individuals on YouTube and other Google products, according to an open letter signed by more than 140 Google employees.\nThe letter asked for support in \"resisting LGBTQ+ oppression on the internet,\" and also said that \"Whenever we press for change, we are told only that the company will 'take a hard look at these policies.' But we are never given a commitment to improve, and when we ask when these improvements will be made, we are always told to be patient. We are told to wait. For a large company, perhaps waiting is prudent, but for those whose very right to exist is threatened, we say there is no time to waste, and we have waited too long, already. We are no longer content to wait.\" \nUltimately, Google and YouTube's participation in last year's march was confirmed. A Google spokesperson maintained, in an email to Mashable, that the company advocates for policies and laws that support the LGBTQ+ community, and supports its employees with same-sex health benefits. \nAddressing SF Pride's latest vote, the Google spokesperson told Mashable: \"Google has been a proud supporter of San Francisco Pride for over a decade. We’re saddened that seven members, including a recently fired employee, decided to recommend banning Google, YouTube, and our employees from supporting this important community organization. SF Pride has over 300 members and a separate Board that makes the ultimate decision on participation; we’ll continue to work with the San Francisco Pride Board and its broader membership on next steps.” "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1164767%252F46a5d2f9-1522-4f5e-88a7-0c4e6351fc3b.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=H9qrKP9qgW6PX6xlJYKEIuVT0LI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109630%252Fcc7106d1-b6a7-4486-9ec6-d105a4915db1.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=yjkEI6n-FtvhgGe9Ytq8q1jA20U=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109630%252Fcc7106d1-b6a7-4486-9ec6-d105a4915db1.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=47Mj8fpbxaJAhsXE8tI9fqwQNOE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109630%252Fcc7106d1-b6a7-4486-9ec6-d105a4915db1.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=nAcVnQ7ar6F7Oq746cM7Tdcmkk0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109630%252Fcc7106d1-b6a7-4486-9ec6-d105a4915db1.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=WzmWxLATweZkjw31i-sXX_CWSLo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109630%252Fcc7106d1-b6a7-4486-9ec6-d105a4915db1.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=d6tx4DXx6XMJYZfqpPDyKU1WEvI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"The resolution received seven votes from the organization's over 300 members.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-san-francisco-pride-google-youtube.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-san-francisco-pride-google-youtube.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1164767%252F46a5d2f9-1522-4f5e-88a7-0c4e6351fc3b.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=K9mgSbMvWL8i_Bx-WS90P-YaXqc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1164767%252F46a5d2f9-1522-4f5e-88a7-0c4e6351fc3b.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=UXoTJr-9OS6o_mKwj_qPmIRbbHQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"The resolution received seven votes from the organization's over 300 members."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Arun Nevader / Getty Images"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"SF Pride voted to ban Google, YouTube.

released a video titled \"I'm Coming Out,\" where she tells her over 12 million subscribers for the first time that she is trans. \n\"Filming this video scary, but it's so liberating and freeing,\" said NikkieTutorials, whose real name is Nikkie De Jager. \"I've been wanting to share this side of myself to all of you for so long but I could never figure out the timing.\"  \n\"Yes I am transgender,\" De Jager said, \"But at the end of the day I am me.\"\nDe Jager went on in the 17-minute video to praise her mother and explain more about her childhood and her transition. She explained that in the 11 years she'd had her channel — and grew to one of the most subscribed beauty gurus on the platform — she had wanted to express this side of herself. She had not because she said she wanted the channel to be about her art. \n\"I wanted the art to do the speaking for me,\" she said. De Jager expressed that her channel will remain the same, but she did not want to hold back or have secrets. She continued, \"From today on, you get me,\" and assured that she will be more open to her subscribers than ever.\nDe Jager started the video by saying she did not expect to tell her subscribers this today. Later in the video, she explained she did this because she was blackmailed. Apparently, the people blackmailing her told her that she was scared — and to that, she gave them the middle finger.\n\"I am free, and today I get to be me,\" she said. \nMinutes after the video was posted it already had topped 300,000 views. Inside a Verily coronavirus testing site: How it works, from screening to diagnosisJoe Biden joins Jimmy Kimmel to talk cooking, coronavirus, and calling out TrumpThe Bon Appétit YouTube stars reveal how they're working from homeJimmy Fallon's at-home monologue gets hilariously heckled by his adorable kids"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=2SR_vFM_qr6ongbGyYLJOsQ8fP0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=8FPsBs3xmgY9o1ZLQJFKAqCJalc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=e52yHj0R_ET-zvldAINQJKDowdY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=RP5JAw_m4byjJ7i_rH-qKtNWw4c=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=VbyIO_Sf2HFaRsaMToc6BsXq3b0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=NzNT1UL6m0g8n_-odCTsd1X1A58=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"YouTuber NikkieTutorials comes out as trans","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=e52yHj0R_ET-zvldAINQJKDowdY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=h2Y_lOe0erhXAEWHZXRELxdSwdk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=ZG14lfb4X_qLGbiu5g40PtJOYjQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=VbyIO_Sf2HFaRsaMToc6BsXq3b0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109207%252Fe688e685-b522-4b19-be76-787d27b3248a.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=e52yHj0R_ET-zvldAINQJKDowdY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"YouTuber NikkieTutorials comes out as trans","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"I am free, and today I get to be me.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"YouTuber NikkieTutorials comes out as trans"},{"_id":"5e0ff0e5f11b2c2e8e00002c","id":"/article/word-of-the-decade-they/","title":"'They' is the word of the decade","title_tag":null,"author":"Jess Joho","post_date":"2020-01-04T01:56:52+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 04 Jan 2020 01:56:52 +0000","formatted_date":"01/04/2020","sort_key":"1INRbb","link":"https://mashable.com/article/word-of-the-decade-they/","content":{"plain":"Words matter — especially to those at the American Dialect Society. So it spoke volumes when the top linguists who make up the group voted to crown the singular pronoun \"they\" as the Word of the Decade at its annual meeting on Friday.\nThe Word of the Decade 2010-2019 is gender-neutral singular \"they\"! #wordofthedecade #woty19— American Dialect Society (@americandialect) January 4, 2020\n\nThe other contenders in the category included #BlackLivesMatter, climate, #MeToo, meme, emoji, opiod crisis, selfie, and woke, according to the society's official Twitter account. It initially came down to a runoff between \"meme\" (at 110 votes) and \"they\" (128), with only singular votes cast for \"emoji\" and \"opioid crisis.\"\nSEE ALSO: The words and phrases that defined the decade\nThe prominence of \"meme\" came a bit as a surprise, since the phenomenon of memes was certainly not exclusive to the decade. Early examples of widely spread memes like the \"can has cheezburger\" cat date back to 2007. To be fair, memes certainly became a more mainstream mainstay in the recent past.\n\"They\" ultimately feels like the more decade-appropriate winner, however, since some of the biggest gatekeepers of the English language officially accepted it in the past 10 years, like when the American Psychological Association officially added it to their guidebook and Merriam Webster named it their 2019 Word of the Year. Another member of the society, Kirby Conrod, spoke to how \"they\" was the only entry on the list that also doubled as a major grammatical change. \n\nMore voices for \"meme\" for #wordofthedecade Jessi Grieser also advocates for \"they\" as a change in a closed class, as well as a reference to the prior Word of the Millennium, \"she\".#woty19 #wordofthedecade— American Dialect Society (@americandialect) January 4, 2020\n\nIn Mashable's own list of words and phrases that defined the decade, the singular \"they\" was also highlighted along with other inclusivity-related words like \"nonbinary\" and \"genderqueer.\"\nThough the American Dialect Society was founded in the 19th century, only two other words have ever been selected for the Word of the Decade honor. \"Web\" won the 1990s, while the verb \"Google\" reigned over the 2000s.\nEntries for the 2019 Word of the Year included “OK Boomer,” “(my) pronouns,” \"cancel,” and “Karen.” Ultimately, \"OK Boomer\" was the runner up at 88 votes and \"(my) pronouns\" won with 161. \"(My) pronouns\" refer to a practice of telling people how to refer to you. Phrases such as she/her, he/him, or they/them could be seen popping up on online profiles throughout 2019.\nNotably, both the year and decade winners reflect the enormous impact our evolving lexicon around gender identity has had on the American language and society.\nUPDATE: Jan. 5, 2020, 10:49 a.m. PST An earlier version of this story misidentified Blake Zimmer as a member of the American Dialect Society"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1134237%252F916673e3-7138-474c-b8a0-74df1fe4d07d.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=KFCbwSrtuMwnjVvnivd-rYG07E8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108789%252F3be58c09-f823-4f65-9fa6-316ee7ed5dd5.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=OsI2Syi8MtRPNUXrzdrXxgw16Gk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108789%252F3be58c09-f823-4f65-9fa6-316ee7ed5dd5.png%252F356x205.png?signature=a9pB25bwj6ViskJlqUELmSsMTzI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108789%252F3be58c09-f823-4f65-9fa6-316ee7ed5dd5.png%252F712x410.png?signature=XpGMoNbpxpiGynagaF2Lw34phno=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108789%252F3be58c09-f823-4f65-9fa6-316ee7ed5dd5.png%252F280x157.png?signature=q1DiIWBYGzTjn9A9qk7e5EEku0Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108789%252F3be58c09-f823-4f65-9fa6-316ee7ed5dd5.png%252F560x314.png?signature=S128GXHXDn8eld9a2wfjF6fJ2oU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"A vote for the importance of inclusive language.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-word-of-the-decade-they.png","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-word-of-the-decade-they.png","micro":1},"src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1134237%252F916673e3-7138-474c-b8a0-74df1fe4d07d.png%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Dc1ziemBjheDLcYUshK_4ynM_T8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1134237%252F916673e3-7138-474c-b8a0-74df1fe4d07d.png%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=pqfMCaecSkW2_ibRPnz9RZ5CiU4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"A vote for the importance of inclusive language."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  BOB AL-GREENE / MASHABLE"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"'They' is the word of the decade","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"A vote for the importance of inclusive language.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Social Good","channel_label":"Social Good","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Social%20Good/","tweet_text":"'They' is the word of the decade"},{"_id":"5dfff55128cc362e1800000e","id":"/article/american-airlines-non-binary-gender-options/","title":"American Airlines now offers non-binary gender options when you book a flight","title_tag":null,"author":"Siobhan Neela-Stock","post_date":"2019-12-22T22:59:25+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 22:59:25 +0000","formatted_date":"12/22/2019","sort_key":"1IJac5","link":"https://mashable.com/article/american-airlines-non-binary-gender-options/","content":{"plain":"If you fly with American Airlines, you now have a choice to designate if you are non-binary with the letter \"U\" or \"X\" during your flight booking process.

Jamil, for her part, responded by coming out as queer on Twitter and the discourse shifted. In addition to addressing valid questions about Jamil’s qualifications to judge house-ballroom, some claimed that Jamil was not really queer — or that she wasn't somehow “queer enough.” \nIt was an online mess that, while not entirely new, reopened old wounds within the queer community and resurfaced anxieties many, including myself, already felt. How queer do you have to be to be “queer enough” for your community? And who gets to decide? And why do such exclusionary ideas fester in a community known for tolerance, anyway?\n✌🏽 pic.twitter.com/YcB6H7YCT0— Jameela Jamil 🌈 (@jameelajamil) February 5, 2020\n\nIs “queer” the new word for “completely heterosexual”?— Goody⚡️Ravenclaw (@GoodyCorvid) February 6, 2020\n\nOops...! pic.twitter.com/1WzK5fRYks— Denise Marie (@Denise001212) February 6, 2020\n\nJamil later said that she had chosen the “most inappropriate time” to come out, but the damage had been done. (There have also been recent rumors about her lying about her illnesses and having Munchausen's — but that’s a whole other controversy.) The internet had become a flurry of discussion about who can judge ballroom and, more insidiously, a discussion of who is and is not queer enough. \nI know this debate well, but it had previously existed for me mostly internally. I am bisexual and have dated both men and women, but I still struggle with wondering whether I am queer enough for the LGBTQ community, given my appearance (“straight-passing”) and the fact that I am not monosexually gay. \nOther queer people have the same anxiety I do and it may be more common than I thought.\nI knew, logically, that I was not alone, but I’ve rarely voiced these concerns for fear of the backlash; that people would say I must be straight or else I wouldn't have such fears. \nThe criticism that sparked Jamil’s coming out ignited a public conversation that solidified my anxiety. It also revealed another truth: Other queer people have the same anxiety I do, and it may be more common than I thought.\n“The situation and its media coverage has honestly inspired a lot of feelings in me,” said Mary, a bisexual 25-year-old I spoke to, who asked to go by first name only for privacy reasons. Mary described herself as “semi-closeted,” and she said that people saying Jamil needed to categorize herself made her uneasy. “It’s hard for me to see this in a clear-cut way because I am unsettled by the unsatisfied masses who seemingly want her to apply a label to herself.”\nMary’s friends and her fiancé know she is bisexual, but her family does not. “It’s hard to watch someone who is in the public eye be boxed into a corner to apply a specific term to herself ... because I worry the same would happen to me if I outed myself to my family,” Mary said. “Seeing that kind of pushback with Jameela makes me antsy; I think it could happen to me too. Or anyone.”\nA bi woman I spoke to — who wished to remain anonymous for privacy reasons — was alarmed by the charges of Jamil not being queer enough. “It has been shocking to see how much this has brought people to explicitly say being bisexual doesn’t make you queer enough,” she told me over Twitter DM. \nGiven the pervasiveness of this anxiety, and the discord it sows within the queer community, I set out to uncover where it came from — and what we can do about it.\n\nDressing “queer” versus straight-passing\nAppearance has a lot to do with this. This is because every group — even countercultural ones — has its own set of norms members may feel pressured to adhere to. “Social psychology predicts that, once a queer person joins a group of peers, that person will experience a pressure to conform to the group's norms,” said Pavel Blagov, associate professor of psychology at Whitman College.\nThere is a “queer aesthetic” that if people, especially women, do not fit into, they may pass as straight. This manifests in fashion choices, makeup use (or lack thereof), and hair. When I cut my hair last month, for example, one of my friends fawned over my fresh “bisexual bob.” It goes without saying that a queer person does not need to “look queer” to be queer — and yet, assumptions pervade in queer culture just as they do among straight people.\nJamil fits well within the “femme” queer categorization: she has long hair, wears dresses and heels, and uses makeup. Passing as straight may afford a bisexual person privileges such as employment opportunities and familial support, but the rug could be pulled out from a bisexual person at a moment’s notice. \nAccording to Kathryn Hobson, an assistant professor of communications studies at James Madison University who has written about and researched femininity and queer identity, femininity is often devalued in queer communities. While she thinks the queer community’s opinion toward femininity is changing within younger generations, Hobson said she has felt that resistance herself as a bi femme. \n“Is it a privilege if you have to come out all the time over and over and over?”\nHobson pushed back at the concept that queer femmes are privileged. “Is it a privilege if you have to come out all the time over and over and over?” she asked. “It doesn't feel like it when you're living that as your everyday experience.” \nI relate to this, having had to, say, come out on a first date with a man if I mention a story about an ex who happens to be a woman. If the choice is between using the wrong pronoun to describe my ex or to come out, I come out even if I was not initially prepared to do so. \nAs Shiri Eisner details in Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution, passing comes at a price. It can mean being in a constant state of worry about being “found out.” It means not only hiding a part of oneself, but hiding past experiences and relationships (with the same gender if passing as straight, and with different genders if passing as gay). \nThis can lead to mental health problems. Bi people do experience a greater likelihood of depression and other mood and anxiety disorders than the broader population, according to the San Francisco Human Rights Commission. It can also lead to punishment should a passing person’s bisexuality be “discovered.” \n“Access to ‘heterosexual privilege,’” wrote Eisner, “... stops at the moment when their heterosexuality is ‘proven otherwise.’” \nQueerness is, of course, not a look but a set of attractions, desires, and behaviors. Even then, however, behavior gets scrutinized — such as how many queer relationships or sexual experiences one has had versus those with someone of a different gender. \nSEE ALSO: Queers Against Pete highlights the LGBTQ community's frustration with Buttigieg\n“Behavior gets judged, too,” Hobson said. “If you're a woman, [you get asked] ‘how many women have you slept with?’ Or, ‘how many queer people have you slept with? Or how much queer sex have you had?'” Bisexual and non-gay queer people feel this pressure to prove themselves, not just in appearance but in their past and experiences. This is despite the fact that actions do not necessarily prove orientation, just as much as appearance doesn’t. \n“In queer communities, I think there's a tendency to try to put people into either a hetero or homo box,” said Hobson. \nBut why? Many queer people live outside binaries that some in straight culture do not understand. And most, if not all, queer folks can relate to feeling othered in heterosexual society at some point in their lives, if not every waking moment. So why do some queer people make fellow queers feel “other,” as they did with Jameela Jamil?\nBiphobia in the queer community\nIn Bi, Eisner writes that that biphobia within gay and lesbian circles is discussed so much because bisexual people come out to those communities seeking acceptance — and sometimes experience the same erasure, exclusion, and biphobia they do in the straight community instead. “This experience is particularly painful,” Eisner writes. “This rejection seems to come from where we least expect it — where we came for support.” \nThis is due both to the psychological and evolutionary causes of prejudice in general, though there are also specific underpinnings for biphobia, according to Blagov. Our brains have evolved to make sense of the world around us by utilizing categories. This can lead to an “us vs. them” mentality, even unconsciously.\n\nCriticism of Jameela is valid and I agree with a lot of it, but damn, is saying that this is why Bi/pan people aren’t “queer enough” or aren’t trusted by the rest of the community really necessary?— Camryn Garrett (@dancingofpens) February 6, 2020\n\nHobson, too, acknowledged the cognitive reason behind this. “No matter what, people want to have some sort of way to categorize people — it's just easier,” she said. Our minds use stereotypes as a kind of “shortcut”; it is part of how our brains are wired. That means queer people aren't immune from stereotyping those in their own community. While it may be due to biology, stereotyping is not okay and can be unlearned — especially with the breadth of online and offline resources by organizations such as GLAAD and The Trevor Project.\nBut it is important to recognize biphobia as a prejudice completely separate from homophobia. “The psychological literature on biphobia does point to at least a couple of specific sources of prejudice against sexual minority individuals and, specifically, bisexual persons,” said Blagov. \nThese reasons include stigmatization about HIV (a straight woman may be biphobic towards a bisexual man, for example, because she believes he might contract HIV from a man); stereotypes about promiscuity and relationship instability; and threats to social power. \nIn terms of the latter and the “us vs. them” mentality, both straight and gay people may see bisexuals as having one foot in the “us” category and one foot in “them” — thus making them some sort of betrayer, or threat to power in the straight or gay community. \nThe feeling is not unique to bisexuals\nOf course, it’s not only bi people who experience feeling not “queer enough” — and it’s not only tied to sexual orientation. \nWriter Cass Marshall is a non-binary queer person married to a cis man, who says they “fly under the radar” by appearing to be a straight woman. “It's a misconception I never want to correct, making me feel semi-closeted, because the idea of announcing these things that aren't necessarily visible is hard,” Marshall told me. \nSEE ALSO: 'They' is the word of the decade\nMarshall found the discussion about Jamil frustrating, and related to her at that moment. “There are times I've had colleagues or peers kind of throw an elbow at me, saying that they wished a queer or trans writer had a perspective on something I wrote about,” they said. “It feels suffocating; I don't want to have to publicly state a part of my identity I'm grappling with in order to win an argument, but it also hurts to just nod and let the assumption that I'm cis and het roll by.”\nOther people I spoke to felt similarly. “It’s a weird balance because the celebration of unique queer cultures is so important and I don’t want to elevate my experience as a white cis straight passing bisexual as the most important. It’s not,” the person who wished to remain anonymous said. “But it’s part of the story.”\nIt does feel like a lose-lose: acknowledging what passing may afford you, but hiding part of your identity as a result. \nBlagov believes feeling “not queer enough” has both intrapersonal and interpersonal roots. Queer people — like everyone — question whether they belong in their group and wonder how to/how much to adapt to the group’s culture. “Becoming and being queer is a process,” said Blagov, “not a static state of affairs.” \n“Becoming and being queer is a process, not a static state of affairs.” \nThose who do not feel “queer enough” may be impacted by messages they receive from their peers or the media. Hobson agreed, stating that judgment by the queer community and outside it creates an anxiety for non-gay queer folks. \nThe queer community has its own set of norms that have to do with both looks and notches on bedposts. Those benchmarks are not only fraudulent but harmful. And they can result in internal trauma (questioning oneself, truly believing you are not queer enough) and outer trauma (violence and isolation, as detailed by Eisner in Bi and other writings on biphobia). \nIt is a mindfuck to think about how a community formed from not fitting society’s heterosexual norm can have its own norms, but it’s true. Those norms may change as time goes on, but norms will always be a part of any culture. Queer folks need to realize that, and also realize it is OK not to fit within them. \n“There is not a ‘right’ way to be queer,” Blagov confirmed. “Queer people's experience, expression, and degree of emotional investment in their queer identity differs from person to person and over time.”\nI did not become “more” bisexual when I cut my hair. I do not become “more” bisexual when I am dating a woman versus “less” bisexual when I date a man. And while the “queer enough” anxiety persists, talking about it helps not only bring it to light, but helps us realize there is no such thing — for me, for Jamil, for any of us. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1220854%252F8bf9d953-ea24-4390-b1e2-c3f923d72112.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Yo49Boh1pZ4drt6AbiTY907hl5o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=redn99roiy8gN_S8uvRNCoje108=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F356x205.png?signature=xtxAszX1wE5kL7l3tS6saGtvle0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F712x410.png?signature=39F2QYUPvlIqagV_IxG2smkoQ3k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F280x157.png?signature=go1vVMLivRiinikHxw8QQ4D7zGs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F560x314.png?signature=D5HKdxZ97BczuH1lTualREv_O_s=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Jameela Jamil, bisexuality, and the anxiety of not feeling 'queer enough'","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F356x205.png?signature=xtxAszX1wE5kL7l3tS6saGtvle0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=BC_u71X_uV3jBsBS2E6QsXHkQfU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=7G5yMwOEhcO-Dx2fMBnySgt6hVQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F280x157.png?signature=go1vVMLivRiinikHxw8QQ4D7zGs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111009%252Fa605bc43-3ec2-4d9f-861e-17fe58f79486.png%252F356x205.png?signature=xtxAszX1wE5kL7l3tS6saGtvle0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Jameela Jamil, bisexuality, and the anxiety of not feeling 'queer enough'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"O4oKAOwmnd","data-ytid":"g0OtMMy-EJ8","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"If you're queer and have ever felt not \"queer enough,\" you're not alone.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Jameela Jamil, bisexuality, and the anxiety of not feeling 'queer enough'"},{"_id":"5e445e71f11b2c04dd00000b","id":"/article/queers-against-pete-buttigieg-lgbtq-community/","title":"Queers Against Pete highlights the LGBTQ community's frustration with Buttigieg","title_tag":null,"author":"Anna Iovine","post_date":"2020-02-12T20:22:08+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 20:22:08 +0000","formatted_date":"02/12/2020","sort_key":"1J20Tj","link":"https://mashable.com/article/queers-against-pete-buttigieg-lgbtq-community/","content":{"plain":"On a certain subsection of Twitter there is a common refrain: LGBTQ — “Let’s Get Buttigieg To Quit.” It’s even made its way onto tote bags. \nTo some, the “slogan” may appear surprising, as Buttigieg is the only out-queer candidate in the 2020 presidential race. For some members of the queer community, however, his campaign is frustrating — especially as he emerges as the centrist pick, having come in second behind Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire primary. His moderate policies, billionaire donors, and the way he's distanced himself from the community (last September he said he stopped reading LGBTQ media) are a few issues cited by his critics.\nThis is not a new revelation, but now that primary voting has begun its impacts are starting to show. Buttigieg came in third with queer Iowans who voted in the caucus, according to New York Times reporting. (They were more likely to vote for Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.) Since Buttigieg’s campaign took off last year, queer people have spoken against the candidate due to the fact that, as BuzzFeed News reporter Shannon Keating wrote in November, he represents “everything the marriage-focused mainstream gay rights movement has failed to deliver.” \nSEE ALSO: Pete Buttigieg's confusing 'shape of our democracy' quote is inspiring memes\n“Marriage equality is not justice or equality for the most marginalized of our community,” Jes Scheinpflug, a community organizer based in Chicago, told Mashable. “He [Buttigieg] talks about marriage equality as if it’s the greatest thing, and it leaves behind so many people.”\nThis is a sentiment that reverberates throughout the progressive queer community: Buttigieg represents respectability and whitewashed politics. For some members of said community — particularly those who are rich, white, and cis — the fight for equality may have ended when same-sex marriage became legal in 2015.\nFor others, however, there are many issues yet to be addressed. For example, LGBTQ voters listed violence against transgender people as the top concern that the community faces in the country, according to an Out magazine and YouGov survey released last November. The issue in second place was workplace discrimination; in 26 states, employees can still be fired for being gay.\nNow, as primary season is underway, some queer voters are pushing back against Buttigieg harder than ever. One collective, called Queers Against Pete, has a mission of doing just that. Queers Against Pete was born out of frustration over Buttigieg’s policies, like his lack of support of free college, and his actions as South Bend mayor, such as how he handled the shooting of black resident Eric Logan by a white police officer. \n“Marriage equality is not justice or equality for the most marginalized of our community.”\nQueers Against Pete organizer Gregory A. Cendana told Mashable he was inspired to get involved in a more active way after seeing Black Lives Matter - South Bend protest Buttigieg in Iowa. “It’s important for us to center black communities,” Cendana said, “Especially because black trans women are disproportionately impacted within the broader LGBTQIA community.”\nCendana said Queers Against Pete wants to push candidates, like Buttigieg, on issues that could be potentially harmful to their communities.\nQueers Against Pete has “been truly grassroots, organic folks all just connecting through our organizer networks,” said Scheinpflug, who was pulled into Queers Against Pete when someone emailed them about shutting Buttigieg down in Chicago.\nIndeed, Queers Against Pete’s first intervention was at Buttigieg’s fundraising event in Chicago shortly before the Iowa caucus. Cendana asked Buttigieg about how a queer teen who has been disowned by their parents would pay for college without universal free college. Scheinpflug asked about Eric Logan. At the end of Buttigieg’s remarks, they chanted “Queers against Pete.”\nNow, the group encourages people who share their sentiment to sign an open letter. “We cannot in good conscience allow Mayor Pete to become the nominee without demanding that he address the needs and concerns of the broader [LGBTQIA] communities,” the letter states. It goes on to detail Buttigieg’s policies the grassroots organization do not support:\n\nQueers Against Pete released a joint press release about the letter with Queers Not Here For Mayor Pete, a group with a similar message. The letter has more than 3,000 signatures thus far and according to Cendana, has representation in all 50 states and DC. \nThe collective has gotten backlash over why they will not support the one openly gay person in the race. To that, Cendana said that identity is only one aspect of a candidate. \n“We have to look at all parts and make informed decisions on all parts, and not focus solely on a particular identity,” he said. “Especially if some of those policies or things folks are pushing for may actually be harmful.”\nCendana believes it’s his duty and the duty of the broader queer community to push candidates, especially Buttigieg, to be responsible and accountable. He wants Buttigieg to hear their concerns and shift his policies to reflect the broader community.\nSEE ALSO: Nevada caucus will use new 'iPad tool' they swear isn't an app and things don't sound great\nScheinpflug echoed Cendana’s concerns about Buttigieg and his commitment to helping all LGBTQ people. “Just because someone’s gay doesn’t mean they’re progressive,” they said. “And it doesn’t mean they care about everyone in the community.” They compared their stance on Buttigieg to that about Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is a black lesbian and has received backlash from the queer community due to her policies. \nCendana compared his feelings on Buttigieg to his feelings on Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard (this interview occurred the day before the New Hampshire primary, where Yang dropped out of the race).  “As a Filipino American and as an Asian American, people are like, ‘What about Andrew Yang? What about Tulsi Gabbard or some of the other Asian American Pacific Islander candidates up and down the ballot?’” \n“In the same way I feel about Mayor Pete and him being gay is the same response I give to Andrew Yang and him being Asian American,” he said. “Just because someone shares a particular identity doesn’t necessarily mean they share values, they share commitment.” \nQueers Against Pete has not endorsed any particular candidate. On the groups’s FAQ page, they state that members support different candidates, some not at all. According to Scheinpflug, the collective has gotten criticized by saying who they’re against and not who they’re for, but they do not think those criticisms hold. \n“I think they don't have the big picture view of what this tactic is,” Scheinpflug said. In their work in local Chicago politics, Scheinpflug has seen the tactic work with initiatives such as No More Joe Moore, which rallied against the incumbent alderman for the 49th ward but did not endorse his competitor, Maria Hadden. Moore was voted out of office. \n“This is a broader call to folks that we care, we matter about who is trying to represent us” \nAs of now, the open letter is Queers Against Pete’s biggest priority. Cendana hopes that as Queers Against Pete’s message spreads and more people become interested, that the group will organize more events. “This is a broader call to folks that we care, we matter about who is trying to represent us, and we’re going to do our due diligence to do what we can to ensure that the most vulnerable in our community are centered and lifted up,” he said.\nScheinpflug wants a candidate who will listen — and they believe Buttigieg has not thus far.\n“There’s video after video of people asking him a question and him ignoring them, especially if they’re not people who paid a lot of money to get into his fundraiser,” they said. Queers Against Pete’s own exchange with Buttigieg in Chicago was caught on video. “He doesn’t want to listen to us. He's literally going out of his way to not listen to us.” \nScheinpflug said that no matter whom the country elects, they and the broader community will disagree, but what’s imperative is having a candidate who will listen. \n“We don't have to agree on everything, but they have to be willing to have those conversations that try to see our side,” they said. “And he's just not even willing to do that.”"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1199745%252F40001516-5395-489c-8c0a-385a9008dde3.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=5nQWNUZ4lpdxzuzwscItkNZK_h0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=osEqwkui2TO_BxDF3F3zDGmJvNk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=DR26WFhgvUW3HyBD8CAx69YacoM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=gUU_2TakI_Q9OItIyLZIk_Ni6Q4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=uLHfiNZyfOIsj4tL-ay-8fAPvx0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=f6FrzCNQ0DjvvwsRYe--Bpwg9Hk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Queers Against Pete highlights the LGBTQ community's frustration with Buttigieg","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=DR26WFhgvUW3HyBD8CAx69YacoM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=utuDHDj97GEhHa0wbhmT19cC5Jo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=whKlQIG3R61py4oACHISRDxnGGE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=uLHfiNZyfOIsj4tL-ay-8fAPvx0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110678%252Fba8bf6d0-7be3-49d6-a508-2f625e09d180.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=DR26WFhgvUW3HyBD8CAx69YacoM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Queers Against Pete highlights the LGBTQ community's frustration with Buttigieg","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"“He doesn’t want to listen to us.

The Unicode Consortium, a non-profit that standardizes languages across digital platforms and devices, on Wednesday announced an upcoming launch of 62 new emoji. Among them are a transgender flag, emoji of 55 gender and skin-tone variants, a polar bear, a teapot, and a ... piñata?\n\nOver the past few years, the Unicode Consortium has been working on integrating more diverse, inclusive emoji — a response to criticisms about how it has been slow to address its lack of diversity. This new collection of emoji hints at their continued effort toward making emoji more inclusive, even in the subtle ways in which they represent different cultures.\nBoba, which is often associated with Asian American culture, is one way of doing that— as is the transgender flag emoji.\n\"For trans folk being able to say 'transgender' in emoji and to be out and proud and let our allies visibly support us is a huge deal for our community,\" Tea Uglow, who helped co-author the proposal for the emoji, said. \"We’re really happy to have finally crossed into mainstream culture. It’s been an amazing team effort around the world.” \nNew emoji typically start rolling onto devices starting September; other platforms release them earlier. Until then, you can think up creative ways to use these new emoji."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1175938%252F70b4823a-ec03-4eb8-863d-25f99b4f726e.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=-C0uFzsZwp2DkbrMPbRxLPv3SXc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110001%252F11ea766d-7c65-4f09-8891-43a3238472d1.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=rc7R7MgCth1Wo4pWnY-cb-IQZXA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110001%252F11ea766d-7c65-4f09-8891-43a3238472d1.png%252F356x205.png?signature=aGxb-ypcsYtQWT-Mn9DWrb3z5jM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110001%252F11ea766d-7c65-4f09-8891-43a3238472d1.png%252F712x410.png?signature=3TptUR5ISODhfMq5HPOVoxDsdZU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

this week, Rachel Slawson, 25, will become the first openly bisexual contestant in the Miss USA competition, a notable first in the pageant's nearly 70 year history, according to NBC News.\nBefore the win, Slawson wrote on Instagram that \"being Queer is not a 'platform.'\" She continued, \"I may be LGBTQ, but that’s just one detail on the list of things that make me Rachel.\" \nSlawson, who wrote on Instagram in another post that she's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has also been vocal about her mental health journey on social media and her personal website.\n\"Through my personal experience with Bipolar Disorder, and searching for my place in the LGBTQ+ community, I would often ask myself, 'Why am I even here?'\" Slawson wrote to Mashable in an emailed statement. \"As I have learned, I am my own why.\"  \nSlawson told Mashable that she is launching an online initiative, dubbed #IAMWHY, to encourage those struggling with mental health issues to be vocal. \n         View this post on Instagram           Being Queer is not a “platform.” The reason I waited so long to come out as a member of the LGBT+ community was that  I didn’t think who I choose to love should define who I am. Life is short. And I have more questions then answers, but one thing I’m sure of is that we came here to love. And if the people I’ve loved means I am “queer” or “bi” or whatever they call it, then I am proud of that. Because I am never going to walk away from an opportunity to love when it’s rare light shines through in a world that is quick to judge and forget. I may be LGBTQ, but that’s just one detail on the list of things that make me Rachel. I hope by sharing this with you, you can believe that it’s okay to accept every way you love in this world. Your love is a gift here, and so are you. The world might not understand, but they don’t need to. Because I am my own why.

Apparently, the people blackmailing her told her that she was scared — and to that, she gave them the middle finger.\n\"I am free, and today I get to be me,\" she said. \nMinutes after the video was posted it already had topped 300,000 views. Inside a Verily coronavirus testing site: How it works, from screening to diagnosisJoe Biden joins Jimmy Kimmel to talk cooking, coronavirus, and calling

skywalker\",\"videoSeriesName\":null}}Light spoilers for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker ahead.\nIn what's become an annoyingly familiar pattern over the past several years, a blockbuster franchise has touted \"LGBTQ representation\" in an upcoming installment, only to deliver the barest minimum imaginable.\nThis time, the film in question is Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and the exclusively gay moment is a kiss between two female Resistance fighters. \nOne of the characters is a speaking role — Commander D'Acy, played in TROS and The Last Jedi by Amanda Lawrence. The other is just some lady; if we've ever seen her before, I don't remember it. Their embrace plays out in the background and is over so quickly, you might have missed it if you reached for your popcorn at the wrong moment.\nIt's bullshit that this is the best Star Wars can do in 2019.\nThe timidity of this scene did not stop J.J. Abrams from talking it up to Variety weeks before TROS' release. In the same interview where he confirmed Finn and Poe would not be boyfriends, Abrams hinted at the possibility of other queer characters coming to Star Wars and stressed that he wanted the world of his film to reflect the real-world population.\n“In the case of the LGBTQ community, it was important to me that people who go to see this movie feel that they’re being represented in the film,” he said at the time. \nThe tiny smooch in TROS echoes the unnamed gay support group attendee in Avengers: Endgame, the two men making eye contact in Beauty and the Beast, the two dudes standing next to each other in Star Trek Beyond, the girlfriends who never even touch hands in Deadpool 2, the husbands with blink-and-you'll-miss-it wedding rings in Alien: Covenant, and the superheroine who didn't go out of her way to deny her \"girlfriend troubles\" in Power Rangers.\nIn each case, the amount of self-congratulation on display seemed wildly out of proportion with the content of the supposed LGBTQ representation itself. (And that's not even getting into characters whose sexualities were mentioned by their performers and writers offscreen but never acknowledged at all onscreen, like Valkyrie in Thor: Ragnarok and Lando in Solo: A Star Wars Story.)\n\nIt's worth acknowledging that, yes, the lesbian couple in TROS is indeed a first for Star Wars. Yes, it's a step forward. Yes, it's better than nothing. Yes, it surely means something to someone. That does matter. \nAnd yes, I'll even grant that it's an improvement on other examples of this trend — like Beauty and the Beast, which never actually confirms that Lefou is gay, just halfheartedly implies it.\nBut after a while, those yeses feel less like markers of progress than of the lack of it.\nLGBTQ characters shouldn't have to be relegated to the sidelines of our culture's biggest, most beloved stories.\nThe relative insignificance of these particular characters is a reminder that more prominent characters like Poe and Finn can't be canonically gay because, as Oscar Isaac put it, \"it's a time when people are too afraid.\" The briefness of the women's embrace reflects the studio's desire to keep even this meager bit of LGBTQ representation contained within a tiny box that they can throw out of the plane if the going gets too rough. Indeed, The Hollywood Reporter writes that that's exactly what Disney has done in Dubai, where the kiss was edited out altogether.\nAnd the fact that it still \"counts\" as an historic first speaks poorly of this franchise and others like it. Even as explicitly queer films from Call Me By Your Name to Love, Simon have wowed critics and cleaned up at the box office, the decision-makers behind Hollywood's biggest blockbusters remain too timid to offer up more than a tiny peck between minor characters.\nSEE ALSO: 'Avengers: Endgame' has the MCU's first canonically gay character\nIt may not be the end of the world that Star Wars won't make StormPilot canon, or Disney won't give Elsa a girlfriend, or Fantastic Beasts won't explore Dumbledore's sexuality, or what have you. There's no shortage of queer characters and queer stories to be found outside these gazillion-dollar properties in 2019; even major movie studios have proven willing to get on board with LGBTQ characters as long as they're not part of a $400 million action-adventure sequel. \nBut LGBTQ characters shouldn't have to be relegated to the sidelines of our culture's biggest, most beloved stories. It's bullshit that this is the best Star Wars can do in 2019, and even more bullshit that this is the second version of this story I've written this year, following Endgame. Make it so I don't find myself rehashing this story yet again in 2020 or 2021 or 2022, Hollywood, and then we'll talk."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108387%252Fc45c5567-85c2-42f6-9efc-130c77979c5f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=42ENtRLHD0tphwTBWHbh2d8lzAE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108387%252Fc45c5567-85c2-42f6-9efc-130c77979c5f.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=-nIl9qfKnBe7eWn7pCrmeWJBHFY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108387%252Fc45c5567-85c2-42f6-9efc-130c77979c5f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ya7UOY91uRz-d6KOwioy9fEBQCo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108387%252Fc45c5567-85c2-42f6-9efc-130c77979c5f.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=FAbzglxMo7m7pLuK8zCaB45Kbew=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

Hallmark Channel pulled four ads for wedding website Zola because they featured a same-sex couple, bending to pressure from conservative group One Million Moms. Now it seems Hallmark is bending back the other way, pledging to reinstate the blushing brides after widespread backlash.\nA Hallmark Channel spokesperson initially told the New York Times the ads' removal was due to a company policy \"not to air overt public displays of affection in our sponsored advertisement, regardless of the participants.\" \nHowever, Zola disputed this claim.\n\"The only difference between the commercials that were flagged and the ones that were approved was that the commercials that did not meet Hallmark’s standards included a lesbian couple kissing,\" Zola's chief marketing officer Mike Chi told the Hollywood Reporter. \"Hallmark approved a commercial where a heterosexual couple kissed.\" \nThe hashtag #BoycottHallmarkChannel quickly spread on Twitter in the wake of Hallmark's decision to pull the ads, as celebrities such as Ellen DeGeneres, Monica Lewinsky, and Bridget Regan drew attention to the issue. Zola also pulled all their advertising from Hallmark. \n\"All kisses, couples and marriages are equal celebrations of love and we will no longer be advertising on Hallmark,\" said Chi.\nIsn’t it almost 2020? @hallmarkchannel, @billabbottHC... what are you thinking? Please explain. We’re all ears.— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) December 15, 2019\n\nTRY THIS @hallmarkchannel : We apologize to the LGBTQ community + your allies. We used an outdated mode of decision making. It was wrong. We’re sorry. We’re taking steps to make sure this never happens again.We’re now running the ad in all of our programming every comm break.— Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) December 15, 2019\n\nDear Hallmark,Is the loss of some of your viewers more important than the erasure of an entire group of people? (An open letter)@hallmarkchannel @billabbottHC pic.twitter.com/Igj9HYby9G— Elise Bauman (@baumanelise) December 15, 2019\n\nHey @hallmarkchannel, this is incrediblly disappointing and disheartening. I thought #Hallmark was all about spreading love -especially this time of year. Instead you are endorsing discrimination. It’s time to give respect to LGBTQ families and communities. 🏳️&#x200d🌈 https://t.co/l2cfh2pskb— Bridget Regan (@BridgetRegan) December 15, 2019\n\nSEE ALSO: Hallmark Channel faces online backlash for pulling LGBT ads\nNow, Hallmark has said it will reinstate the pulled ads, giving viewers back their lesbians this Christmas.\n\"The Crown Media team has been agonizing over this decision as we’ve seen the hurt it has unintentionally caused,\" Hallmark Cards president and CEO Mike Perry said in a statement. \"Said simply, they believe this was the wrong decision.\" \n\"We are truly sorry for the hurt and disappointment this has caused ... Across our brand, we will continue to look for ways to be more inclusive and celebrate our differences.\"\nThe company's films aren't exactly known for their diversity, with this incident only serving to highlight this fact. Nevertheless, Hallmark claims it \"is, and always has been, committed to diversity and inclusion — both in our workplace as well as the products and experiences we create.\"\n\n\"It is never Hallmark's intention to be divisive or generate controversy,\" said a statement released by the company. \"We are an inclusive company and have a track record to prove it.\" Oddly in light of what kicked off this furore, Hallmark backed its claims by saying it \"feature[s] LGBTQ couples in commercials.\" \nHallmark has been making noises about increasing diversity for years, but has struggled to follow through. In November, the Hollywood Reporter found only four of Hallmark's 24 original holiday movies this year feature black leads, down from five out of 21 last year. None feature LGBTQ characters. \nNow that the company is seeing real financial consequences to the glacial pace at which they're changing, there's much more incentive for them to finally start walking the walk. \n\"The Hallmark Channel will be reaching out to Zola to reestablish our partnership and reinstate the commercials,\" Hallmark said."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108123%252F3ee1ff21-2073-4599-9f76-a4da2f410aed.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=VPn4btZbVta1isTNAi5fJHRvpGU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108123%252F3ee1ff21-2073-4599-9f76-a4da2f410aed.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=RxAUL5H6b6cM4hq8oxx0FXF5y3M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108123%252F3ee1ff21-2073-4599-9f76-a4da2f410aed.png%252F356x205.png?signature=DRI9EHMSgfhlo0K0fXwqcKawEEI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108123%252F3ee1ff21-2073-4599-9f76-a4da2f410aed.png%252F712x410.png?signature=66ikVuANredYPSWK1d_F5LT2K_Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108123%252F3ee1ff21-2073-4599-9f76-a4da2f410aed.png%252F280x157.png?signature=9etaLHbzUc2QPOLf9nOStu7AesY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108123%252F3ee1ff21-2073-4599-9f76-a4da2f410aed.png%252F560x314.png?signature=C_53PazLM846tjXJcmK6eCmUUjU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"After widespread backlash, Hallmark will bring back the lesbian wedding ad","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108123%252F3ee1ff21-2073-4599-9f76-a4da2f410aed.png%252F356x205.png?signature=DRI9EHMSgfhlo0K0fXwqcKawEEI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108123%252F3ee1ff21-2073-4599-9f76-a4da2f410aed.png%252F280x157.png?signature=9etaLHbzUc2QPOLf9nOStu7AesY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108123%252F3ee1ff21-2073-4599-9f76-a4da2f410aed.png%252F356x205.png?signature=DRI9EHMSgfhlo0K0fXwqcKawEEI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"After widespread backlash, Hallmark will bring back the lesbian wedding ad","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Merry Christmas!

Unlike most regular twins like myself, the pair are able to wield the powers you all somehow think twins genuinely have to share thoughts and memories — in this case, it helps to investigate a mystery from their apparently turbulent childhood.\n\n“The core mechanic of the game is the special bond Tyler and Alyson share and is also a theme strongly anchored into the DONTNOD storytelling approach,” said Tell Me Why game director Florent Guillaume in a press statement.\n“Over the course of the story, players will explore the identical twins’ different memories of key events and choose which memory to believe. Ultimately, the choices players make determine the strength of the twins’ bond — and the future course of their lives.” \nSEE ALSO: 10 self-care lessons I learned from video games (don’t look at me like that)\nMaking history, Tyler is the first playable protagonist from a major game studio and publisher who is also transgender. Not only is the voice actor for Tyler transgender too, but DONTNOD worked closely with both Microsoft and LGBTQ media advocacy organization GLAAD on the game, making sure to shape Tyler both as an authentic representation of the trans experience, and a nuanced, multi-dimensional character in his own right. \n\n“Microsoft and DONTNOD have approached Tyler with a real commitment to authenticity,” said  Nick Adams, director of transgender representation at GLAAD in a statement. “Tyler is a fully-realized, endearing character, whose story is not reduced to simplistic trans tropes. Creating a playable lead trans character — and taking such care to get it right — raises the bar for future LGBTQ inclusion in gaming.” \n“Tyler is a fully-realized, endearing character, whose story is not reduced to simplistic trans tropes.\"\n“I think what they're doing here is really uniquely special. It is the first-ever openly transgender playable character in a video game. And I think in today's day and age, it's great that we can bring that to market in a really thoughtful and inclusive way,” Aaron Greenberg, general manager, Xbox Games Marketing, told Mashable. \n“When you do take a sense of responsibility to do these things for the first time, you want to try to do it right. We've tried our best to do that. But ultimately, the most important thing is that it's a great game,” he added. “I think we have a sense of team pride about it, because it's so unique … hopefully, fans and the transgender community and the LBGTQ community will respond positively to it as well.”\nDONTNOD released the debut trailer for the game on Thursday, in which you can get a peek at the crisp Alaskan landscape, as well as hints of the mystery the twins will unravel. If all we’re going off is the heavy realism of Life Is Strange, and the snippets of repressive family conversation and loaded guns from the trailer, we’re expecting things to get pretty dark for Tyler and Alyson.\n\nTell Me Why is coming to Xbox One, Windows 10 PC, Xbox Game Pass and Steam in summer 2020. The three chapters will come out one after another, but DONTNOD promises there won’t be big gaps between them."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1080303%252F6d33319e-10ae-454f-8c16-c47a0011ca45.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=WWJzPqE00_nUBJM7Gns01Q0sC8k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106439%252F327f1aa0-ea5b-4d3a-9306-ed6fdacaa42e.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=UTjwCD1DDR4Gr9Bc7E7m_gO7PAc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106439%252F327f1aa0-ea5b-4d3a-9306-ed6fdacaa42e.png%252F356x205.png?signature=yFt3qUEbJ_1xjc37OXbSg2TMT5c=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106439%252F327f1aa0-ea5b-4d3a-9306-ed6fdacaa42e.png%252F712x410.png?signature=5HrvILrt0CeRbwvLrSGIwldBGNc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106439%252F327f1aa0-ea5b-4d3a-9306-ed6fdacaa42e.png%252F280x157.png?signature=Y4juL4a2PqCdyPydrUKQkl0Uk2c=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106439%252F327f1aa0-ea5b-4d3a-9306-ed6fdacaa42e.png%252F560x314.png?signature=uBfWNc96opyt-YUBImXyr9asiN4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'Tell Me Why' makes history with the first transgender protagonist from a major game studio","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106439%252F327f1aa0-ea5b-4d3a-9306-ed6fdacaa42e.png%252F356x205.png?signature=yFt3qUEbJ_1xjc37OXbSg2TMT5c=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106439%252F327f1aa0-ea5b-4d3a-9306-ed6fdacaa42e.png%252F280x157.png?signature=Y4juL4a2PqCdyPydrUKQkl0Uk2c=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106439%252F327f1aa0-ea5b-4d3a-9306-ed6fdacaa42e.png%252F356x205.png?signature=yFt3qUEbJ_1xjc37OXbSg2TMT5c=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"'Tell Me Why' makes history with the first transgender protagonist from a major game studio","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"“Tyler is a fully-realized, endearing character, whose story is not reduced to simplistic trans tropes.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Tell Me Why' makes history with the first transgender protagonist from a major game studio"},{"_id":"5d9c4e0a9111ae5fdd000005","id":"/article/big-mouth-creator-apology-season-3-pansexual-character/","title":"'Big Mouth' co-creator responds to backlash over Season 3's pansexual character","title_tag":null,"author":"Caitlin Welsh","post_date":"2019-10-08T08:51:20+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 08 Oct 2019 08:51:20 +0000","formatted_date":"10/08/2019","sort_key":"1IhRKh","link":"https://mashable.com/article/big-mouth-creator-apology-season-3-pansexual-character/","content":{"plain":"Big Mouth, Netflix's filthy cartoon chronicle of puberty problems, has been praised for its shameless take on how everyone explores their own sexuality at every stage of life. And while it crosses lines in every episode, it's usually in service of choosing relatability, insight, and a laugh over good taste.\nBut a scene in an episode from Season 3, which dropped on Netflix on Friday, attracted criticism over a new pansexual character's definition of their orientation.\nNew student Ali (voiced by Ali Wong) introduces herself to her Bridgeton Middle School homeroom class, saying she's a Ravenclaw and also pansexual, which she defines as attraction that's not limited by gender identity. Nick Birch (Nick Kroll) asks if it's the same as being bisexual, which Ali rejects as \"so binary.\"\n\"Some of you borings like tacos and some of you like burritos, and if you're bisexual, you like tacos and burritos,\" she explains. \"But I'm saying I like tacos and burritos, and I could be into a taco that was born a burrito. Or a burrito that is transitioning into a taco.\"\nGuys, @aliwong is now on @bigmouth. It makes SO much sense. pic.twitter.com/5S76ezwIuD— Netflix Is A Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke) October 5, 2019\n\nTired food analogies reducing people to their genitals aside, Ali's implication is that a) bisexuals aren't attracted to people who aren't cis men or cis women, and b) people who are trans are a separate category only pan people are attracted to, no matter their gender. \nIt's perhaps understandable that some people still link the \"bi\" in bisexual to the \"bi\" in binary, and bi folks have had to do some work in recent years to clear up the outdated misconception Ali's definition perpetuates: that \"swinging both ways\" also means believing there are only two directions in which one can swing. \nEveryone's definition of their sexuality is theirs to shape, but broadly speaking, bisexuality is being more widely understood as being attracted to \"same and different genders\" — which can and does include nonbinary and gender-fluid people — rather than \"men and women.\" More importantly, you don't have to identify as pansexual to be attracted to trans men and women — because they're men and women. \"Including\" trans people but putting them in a separate category to cis people is still transphobic.\nThe response to the scene from fans was swift and strong, with many especially disappointed that the scene sat alongside the arc of the character Jay (Jason Mantzoukas) working out that he's bisexual, including a song that took a much less reductive look at sexual preferences. \nAnd while it's true that the 13-year-old characters aren't going to be 100 percent across this, Ali's explanation is framed as pretty authoritative, even (or especially) in the out-of-context clip.\nNot only is this biphobic, transphobic, and panphobic with extremely incorrect definitions, but they've made this weird image where pansexuality is seen as morally higher than bisexuality. Not only that, but everyone in the room treated the term pansexual like a dirty word. https://t.co/CqlMrkA0EM— 𝐍𝐢𝐜𝐨 ✦ 𝐒𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐲 𝐃𝐲𝐤𝐞 (@spicygemss) October 6, 2019\n\n2.) Even if later context improves the scene, sharing this sans context provides an inherently transphobic explanation of bi versus pansexuality.— Emily VanDerWerff (@tvoti) October 7, 2019\n\n3.) Being pan is framed as being attracted to men, women, and trans people. But, like, \"trans person\" is not a gender. I am a LADY.If it were somehow \"there are many expressions of gender, and I find all attractive,\" fine, but then you couldn't make a taco joke.— Emily VanDerWerff (@tvoti) October 7, 2019\n\nI really love Big Mouth and just saw The Scene from the new season and wow what an easily-avoidable offensive massive fuck-up!— N is for Nicole, Who Fell Off a Cliffe (@Nicole_Cliffe) October 7, 2019\n\nOne thing that’s especially glaring / bad (imo) about them getting bi vs pansexual wrong is that this whole show is all about explaining sexual concepts no? Like if you’re going to take up that mantle and peddle yourself as being knowledgeable then this is even worse. https://t.co/jvQyJZN1Er— Sophia Benoit (@1followernodad) October 8, 2019\n\nThis is a harmful and incorrect definition of bisexuality. @netflix— Rachel Walden (@rachel_w) October 6, 2019\n\nThis bit was definitely written by a cis straight person. 🤦🏻&#x200d♂️ Bisexuality includes binary trans people & always has. If she means she's attracted to nonbinary and two-spirit people then sure, maybe pansexuality is a better label, but the way they're explaining it here is so wrong.— Elliott 🌿 (@BecomingElliott) October 7, 2019\n\nOh cool oh great big mouth defined pansexual completely wrong and used the biphobic transphobic definition this sucks the scene also seems like it’s trying really hard to ignore talking about non-binary people guhhhhHh— Kota 🐾 (@Snortrax) October 6, 2019\n\nbig mouth slapped until they decided that bisexuality excludes transgender people which is INCORRECT delete the scene and try again y’all— micah ♂ (@micahxrutland) October 7, 2019\n\nOn Monday evening, Andrew Goldberg, who created the series with Kroll, quote-tweeted the clip with a Notes app screenshot addressing the feedback from disappointed fans.\n\"We missed the mark here with this definition of bisexuality vs. pansexuality, and my fellow creators and I sincerely apologize for making people feel misrepresented. Any time we try to define something as complex as human sexuality, it's super challenging, and this time we could have done better. Thank you to the trans, pan, and bi communities for further opening our eyes to these important and complicated issues of representation. We are listening and we look forward to delving into all of this in future seasons.\"\nhttps://t.co/TyJ0ZrQjwb pic.twitter.com/49H6UwbU9n— Andrew Goldberg (@BigMouthAndrew) October 7, 2019\n\nThe show shoehorns a lot of genuinely useful, educational, and destigmatising moments in alongside the raunchy jokes. Alongside irresponsible or misjudged bits like this (or Coach Steve's first time) that miss the mark, there are plenty that nail it (like the show's takes on Planned Parenthood and enthusiastic consent last season). A scene that misrepresents at least three communities in a single exchange is especially disappointing in a show that's trying to make people feel less weird and alone. \nSEE ALSO: All hail the drag Hormone Monstress dancing to 'bubble bath'\nBut Goldberg's apology seems to suggest that the show will revisit the bi/pan conversation in one of the three future seasons Netflix has already ordered, hopefully more aware of where that missed mark actually is. While it started as a loosely autobiographical story about his and Kroll's journey into adulthood as straight dudes, listening more to people with different experiences can make the story richer, funnier, and of course, ever hornier."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104269%252Fb81e8bb8-94b4-4f72-858e-eac5f895e999.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Bown0EOHozjyPkkqQXAIged2dwY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104269%252Fb81e8bb8-94b4-4f72-858e-eac5f895e999.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=CbqRT59m5i86ogdLUz8YLhwcMjs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104269%252Fb81e8bb8-94b4-4f72-858e-eac5f895e999.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ZlaFXmcvBXLQLGL7_nwtfL1uc6Y=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104269%252Fb81e8bb8-94b4-4f72-858e-eac5f895e999.png%252F712x410.png?signature=11oKAuBlb6KlNjdYwHh47x8FUUc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104269%252Fb81e8bb8-94b4-4f72-858e-eac5f895e999.png%252F280x157.png?signature=AFs2CMf5bnbNTkk8IgjAgPh57XQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104269%252Fb81e8bb8-94b4-4f72-858e-eac5f895e999.png%252F560x314.png?signature=k6WyZZjHAsISM3Ttdm0ew-RNyCM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'Big Mouth' co-creator responds to backlash over Season 3's pansexual character","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104269%252Fb81e8bb8-94b4-4f72-858e-eac5f895e999.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ZlaFXmcvBXLQLGL7_nwtfL1uc6Y=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104269%252Fb81e8bb8-94b4-4f72-858e-eac5f895e999.png%252F280x157.png?signature=AFs2CMf5bnbNTkk8IgjAgPh57XQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104269%252Fb81e8bb8-94b4-4f72-858e-eac5f895e999.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ZlaFXmcvBXLQLGL7_nwtfL1uc6Y=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"'Big Mouth' co-creator responds to backlash over Season 3's pansexual character","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The show's take on what being bisexual means ruffled a lot of rainbow feathers.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Big Mouth' co-creator responds to backlash over Season 3's pansexual character"},{"_id":"5d8e710c9111ae34df00003b","id":"/article/everlast-patricio-manuel-be-first/","title":"Everlast chooses first transgender boxer to represent their brand","title_tag":null,"author":"Siobhan Neela-Stock","post_date":"2019-09-27T20:28:58+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 20:28:58 +0000","formatted_date":"09/27/2019","sort_key":"1IedzH","link":"https://mashable.com/article/everlast-patricio-manuel-be-first/","content":{"plain":"The first transgender professional boxer, Patricio Manuel, is now also representing Everlast in its \"Be First\" campaign. \nThe premier boxing brand spotlights inclusivity in sports with its campaign, championing other underdogs such as Jinji Martinez, an amputee boxer. \nFirst is Patricio Manuel https://t.co/1L2wI2LavI— Everlast (@Everlast_) September 26, 2019\n\nBefore Manuel transitioned, he was sidelined by an injury while competing in the 2012 Olympic trials, CNN reports.  \nManuel fought his way back into the ring but this time as a male fighter.
