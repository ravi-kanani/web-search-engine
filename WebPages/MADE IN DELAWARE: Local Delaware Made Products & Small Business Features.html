But w’re just got to tell you about Tatanka Sauce, which we discovered recently when it was named the best hot sauce in the state …</p> 
          <p>The term “hot sauce” is a bit misleading in this case, because <a href="http://www.tatankasauce.com" target="_blank">Tatanka Sauce</a> is much more versatile … it’s more of a table sauce that can be used as a marinade and a pick-me-up for omelets, stews, chili, oysters, grilled shrimp, tacos, and much more.</p> 
          <p>The company is based in Camden, DE and they make four different heat levels, ranging from the Original to Tatanka X, where the “X” means be careful, this sauce is hot! The Original is in our estimation the perfect blend of flavor with a little bit of heat – it’s made with a mixture of Parmesan cheese, garlic, butter, spices, honey, brown sugar, and red pepper sauce.</p> 
          <p>You can find it in retail outlets across The First State (there’s a list on their website) but if you’re elsewhere, order directly from their online store. Tasty stuff from Delaware!</p>

          <p>One of our favorite places in the city is Feby’s Fishery, located on Lancaster Pike. We stop here for lunch every time we’re near Wilmington, and it’s always a pleasure to dig into some of their fresh fish sandwiches like the Chesapeake Crab Roll or the glorious Grouper Reuben Panini. There’s an adjacent Feby’s Seafood Market which sells fresh fish to local residents, as well as some Feby’s hot pepper sauces as shown in the picture …</p> 
          <p>The four sauces feature a chipotle, habanero, cayenne, and a super hot sauce with a mix of peppers. Naturally, they all complement a fish dinner!</p> 
          <p>You’ll find these sauces for sale at the <a href="http://www.feysfishery.com" target="_blank">Feby’s Fishery</a> website, where you can order single bottles or a gift pack of all four.

           <p id="caption-attachment-6992" class="wp-caption-text"><b>Loockerman Street, Downtown Dover, DE</b></p>
          </div>Welcome to our ongoing series “Visiting America’s State Capital Cities”! 
          <p></p> 
          <p>On a recent excursion out to the east coast, we were fortunate enough to visit Dover for a day on our way down to Lewes and the Delaware beach area, just 45 minutes away. Dover is centrally located in The First State, about 90 minutes from Philadelphia and less than an hour south from Wilmington, the state’s largest city …</p> 
          <p>When most people visit Delaware, it’s a safe bet they’re headed to the coastal area. In summer, the population swells as vacationers and families head to the beach and seaside accommodations. As such, Dover is generally regarded as a town to pass through rather than stop and linger, unless you’re on state business …</p> 
          <p>Well, we weren’t on any sort of business other than seeing what this capital city of slightly less than 40,000 residents had to offer. And we’re happy to tell you … more than you might think!</p> 
          <p>Leaving Philadelphia early morning, we were ready to start our Dover day just after breakfast. Let’s give you an overview and tell you all about Dover! </p> 
          <p><b><em>Dover Overview</em></b></p> 
          <p>At just under 40,000 population, Dover isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination. The city is located on the St. Jones River and features a central square known as The Green, which has witnessed a lot of history over the years and is now a site on the recently designated First State National Historical Park.. The city was once a stop on the Underground Railroad and if you’re an historian or architecture fan, you’ll find many buildings here which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places …</p> 
          <p></p>
          <div id="attachment_6993" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
           <a href="https://www.stategiftsusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Dovre-The-Green.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6993" src="https://www.stategiftsusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Dovre-The-Green.jpg" alt="The Green, Dover" width="250" height="188" class="size-full wp-image-6993"></a>
           <p id="caption-attachment-6993" class="wp-caption-text"><b>Stroll The Green in Historic Dover</b></p>
          </div>If Dover weren’t a state capital, one might consider it as having a college town feel. Delaware State University is located here, along with the smaller Wesley College and a branch of the University of Delaware. Government and the military have the largest presence though – they’re the top two employers in the city.
          <p></p> 
          <p>For Nascar fans, the famed Dover International Speedway hosts two large races yearly, and the nearby Dover Downs is a popular horse racing facility.</p> 
          <p>We’re told the weather here is pretty nice – four distinct seasons and relatively mild winters. Summer can get a little sticky, but long spring and fall seasons more than make up for it … </p> 
          <p><b><em>What To See &amp; Do In Dover</em></b></p> 
          <p>If you’re visiting Dover for the first time as we were, a good starting point to get your bearings is at The Green. This historic center of town park is a noted local gathering place and on summer evenings you’re likely to see local events and band concerts. It’s the location of the Delaware Archives building, which also contains the Delaware Visitors Center, a convenient place to pick up maps and brochures and get the pulse of the city. The helpful staff here can offer suggestions according to your interests …</p>

The Old State House offers tours, with costumed guides who tell Delaware’s story from Colonial days onward. If it’s a nice day, hook up with a First State Heritage Park Walking Tour. They’re offered Monday through Saturday and last about 45 minutes. Starting at the John Bell House on The Green, you’ll get an entertaining overview of Delaware’s history from local historians … and best of all, they’re free!
          <p></p> 
          <p>While you’re strolling The Green, be sure to stop in at the <a href="http://www.delaware-store.com" target="_blank">Delaware Store</a>, where you’ll find Delaware themed gift items and prints by local artists.

          <p>Area wise, Dover isn’t that large, so getting around the city is relatively easy. You’ll want to head to Dover’s historic downtown area, the heart of which is Loockerman Street. If you’re in the mood for shopping, you’re in luck … Delaware shopping is tax free!</p> 
          <p>There are all kinds of stores and services here. One of the shops you’ll want to visit is The Dover Art League, where you can shop for original artwork from local artists …</p> 
          <p>Farther afield, if you’re heading toward the Delaware beaches, plan a stop at the <a href="http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/coastal/DNERR/Pages/StJonesReserve.aspx">Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve</a>, which is just south of Dover on Route 1. This is the St. Jones Reserve, situated along the St. Jones River. Here you can enjoy hiking trails and hands on exhibits featuring the estuaries (inland waterways) of the Delaware Bay area. Be sure to stop at the Delaware Native Plant Society nursery on site to discover the unique flora of The First State.</p>

Loockerman. This is a good place to stop in for a beer and a bite, with big windows overlooking the foot traffic on Loockerman. 33 West offers over a dozen beers on tap, including several area brews. The menu features salads, sandwiches, crispy thin crust pizza, ribs, and seafood. Try the broiled crab cake sandwich!</p> 
          <p>Two other popular local choices downtown are Frazier’s on the Water, a casual family owned spot overlooking the St. Jones River, and McGlynn’s, a lively Irish pub. For happy hour or if you’re staying the night in Dover, check out the Golden Fleece Tavern, a popular evening destination with occasional live music and great drink specials. The Golden Fleece is a reincarnation of the original tavern of the same name originally located on The Green …</p> 
          <p>You won’t go wrong stopping at any of the places mentioned above! </p> 
          <p><b><em>Summary &amp; Learn More About Dover</em></b></p> 
          <p>We were so pleased to experience Dover! It’s a convenient stop on your way to or from the Delaware beaches and small enough to cover in a day. Plus, it’s a very manageable drive to the shore – only about 40-50 minutes to Rehoboth Beach and Lewes …</p> 
          <p>Dover offers a great deal of history – The Green is steeped in the very essence of Delaware and the city is compact enough to explore on foot. The entire central Delaware area is awash with attractions – whether you’re an outdoors enthusiast or simply like to explore museums or the state’s many wineries and breweries. There’s plenty to see and do in The First State …</p>
