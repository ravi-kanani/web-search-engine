          <p>If you’ve been following State Gifts USA for any length of time, you know how much we like to feature local honey producers. Much like wine, honey offers slight or even pronounced flavor differences depending on where it’s produced. Seasonality plays a factor too – spring honey tends to be lighter with a sweet floral flavor, while autumn honey tends to be darker and richer.</p> 
          <p>Of course, the ultimate factor in a honey’s flavor is what and where the bees pollinate. And that’s why honey from one part of the country will offer a distinctly different flavor profile vs. another area. We try to sample local honey whenever we travel and you should too!</p> 
          <p>If you’d like to try New Hampshire made honey, <a href="http://www.nhhoneybee.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New Hampshire Honey Bee</a> is an excellent choice. At their website, you can order in a variety of sizes – we were especially drawn to their Sampler Gift Crate, which includes a bottle of spring and autumn honey. Taste the difference and see which you like best!</p>
