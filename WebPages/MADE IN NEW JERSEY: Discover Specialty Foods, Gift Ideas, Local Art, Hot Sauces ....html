When we see something interesting on the shelves, it tends to come home with us, even when we travel. That’s what happened on a recent trip through The Garden State …</p> 
          <p>We happened across a few jars of salsa from a local New Jersey company called <a href="https://https://squareup.com/market/crazy-steves-pickles-and-salsa" target="_blank">Crazy Steve’s Pickles &amp; Salsa</a>. Well, if Steve is crazy, he’s crazy like a fox because the salsa he makes is really good! After doing a bit of research, we found out the company makes several varieties of pickles too. We didn’t get to try any, but they’re available at the Crazy Steve online store (the link above goes directly to it). The salsas we tried were the Medium Mesquite Fire Roasted Salsa and the Mango Raspberry variety. They’re both medium heat level, which is what we like. Jalapenos and a bit of habanero create the heat, while fire roasted tomatoes and fresh mango and red raspberries balance things out …</p> 
          <p>Crazy Steve’s also makes three different Bloody Mary mixes and a half dozen varieties of pickles, all of which you can purchase online and have shipped. Get a little Crazy! Direct from The Garden State … </p>

          <p>Fralinger’s offers <a href="http://www.Fralingers.com" target="_blank">16 flavors of salt water taffy</a>, all individually wrapped. They’re as colorful as they are soft and chewy, and make the perfect New Jersey gift for anyone with a sweet tooth!</p> 
          <p>The company produces an amazing 600,000 pounds of salt water taffy yearly. The name “salt water” taffy allegedly originated when a Boardwalk taffy stand was sprayed with a gush of seawater, dousing the inventory and causing the owner to wryly dub the taffy “salt water taffy”. For the record, salt water is not an ingredient in these candies …</p> 
          <p>Fralinger’s ships their products all over the country. Souvenir tins depicting Atlantic City scenes are the most popular gift items … </p>
