Michael learned of chili pepper infused honey while living abroad and honed his own unique recipe. While apprenticing at a local Brooklyn pizza parlor, he began experimenting with the honey atop the pizza, to rave reviews from customers.</p> 
          <p>Michael began bottling the honey and soon a new business was born. Even if you don’t live in Brooklyn, you can purchase some of this unique honey directly at his website. It’s great basted on ribs, pairs wonderfully well with all kinds of cheese, and works perfectly with chicken and pork dishes.</p>

          <p>The company is <a href="http://www.betteroffspread.com" target="_blank">Better Off Spread</a> and their flagship products are gourmet nut butters offering flavor profiles that’ll get your creative juices flowing in the kitchen. The Ace of Spice jar we tried looks and spreads like a peanut butter but offers so much more! Sure, you can use it on two slices of fresh bread, but think outside the box – this stuff is perfect to mix into stir fry dishes, in wraps and burritos, or stirred into leftover spaghetti noodles for a quick Asian style treat. It offers the spiciness of ground organic Szechuan peppercorns, black sesame seeds, grond red chili peppers, and sea salt. Unlike any nut butter you’ve ever tried!</p> 
          <p>Ace of Spice is just one of many flavors the company offers, another being the White Chocolate Cinnamon Peanut Butter shown. They’re all available for purchase online at their website.

          <p>The company is called <a href="http://www.tinmustard.com" target="_blank">Tin Mustard</a> and it’s owned and operated by a Slovenian born chef named Tin Dizdarevic. He originally developed a mustard to pair with a charcuterie platter he was serving and did he ever create a winning recipe!</p> 
          <p>The original, Whole Grain, is a whole grain mustard without any of the bitterness or overly vinegar flavor some such mustards possess. This one features a creamy texture and the mustard seeds are whole, not ground. That means you get to experience the nifty little crunch of the seeds – it’s akin to enjoying a slice of really good whole grain bread that somehow offers a creamy dimension. If my description doesn’t make much sense, well, try it for yourself and you’ll see what I’m talking about!</p> 
          <p>Tin Mustard also makes a smoother variety, introduced in Spring, 2014. Appropriately enough, it’s called Smooth and it offers the same great flavor.</p> 
          <p>If you like a great mustard, all we can say is try this stuff. A friend brought us a jar of each (you can order at their website) and we were literally looking for things to put it on … it’s that good!</p>

          </div><b>Saratoga Peanut Butter Company</b>: Normally we like peanut butter straight up, without any added ingredients. But this stuff is nothing short of spectacular …
          <p></p> 
          <p>This take on peanut butter made by the <a href="http://www.yopeanut.com" target="_blank">Saratoga Peanut Butter Company</a> is outrageously good. It’s a combination of almond butter which is blended with Saratoga’s plain peanut butter. But that’s not all … added to the mix are red cranberries, flax seeds, sunflower seeds for crunch, a bit of pure clover honey and a dash of cinnamon. If that sounds really good, it’s because it is!</p> 
          <p>You can order this delicious Saratoga Peanut Butter blend, called Adirondack, along with their other peanut butter varieties … </p> 
          <p>If you’ve got a peanut butter fan on your gift list, this will make them smile!</p>

          </div><b>New York State Fair Spiedie Sauce</b>: So what’s a spiedie, you might ask?
          <p></p> 
          <p>The term “spiedie” is an offshoot of the Italian word “spiedo”, which means spit (as in a grill). It’s a sandwich originally made with cubed and skewered lamb meat and served right off the grill on a fresh sub roll. A shish kebob sandwich of sorts …</p> 
          <p>Now, spiedies are made with any kind of meat and not just lamb. Basically, whatever meat you prefer. The meat is usually marinated for 24 hours in Spiedie Sauce, which helps flavor and tenderize the meat, and then cooked over a grill, or spit.</p> 
          <p>This is another New York tradition you really don’t see anywhere else. There are several different brands of spiedie sauce you can buy, but the most famous is <a href="http://shop.spiedie.com" target="_blank">New York State Fair Spiedie Sauce</a>, pictured here. It’s a unique flavor that’s really New York!</p>
