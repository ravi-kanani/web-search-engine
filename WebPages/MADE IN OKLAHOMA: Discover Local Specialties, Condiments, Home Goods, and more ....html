It’s a lot of fun sampling different styles of barbecue across the U.S. and smiling whimsically at the “which is best” debates …</p> 
          <p>We have no horse in that race, but we will say the brisket down Oklahoma way is absolutely fantastic. It’s made even better by the addition of some of The Sooner State’s fine barbecue sauces, like one we found in a Tulsa store. It’s actually made in Muskogee and the sauce is simply known as <a href="http://www.jacksbbqsauce.com" target="_blank">Jack’s BBQ Sauce</a> …</p> 
          <p>It’s the pride of the company’s owner, Sharla Jackson McDaniel. Her father Jack Jackson taught Sharla the finer points of barbecue, and some years later she developed and fine tuned the recipe for this wonderful sauce.</p> 
          <p>It’s got a slight peppery kick but it’s not too spicy, nor is it too sweet. Like any great barbecue sauce, it helps bring out the flavor in whatever meat it’s added to – and this stuff is so good you should put it on everything! We stirred some into a bland potato salad and perked it right up!</p> 
          <p>Jack’s is available at select stores which are listed on their website, but if you’re not in the area you can buy it online using PayPal by clicking the “Buy Now” button on the Product page …</p>

And although you often hear claims of “the best” in different regions, it’s enjoyable to compare and contrast the different styles and appreciate their uniqueness.</p> 
          <p>We’re always on the lookout for a great bowl of chili, so when a friend brought us back a seasoning mix from Oklahoma recently, we were anxious to give it a whirl. We highly recommend this mix! It’s from <a href="http://www.oldhammettchili.com" target="_blank">Old Hammett Food Products</a> out of Sapulpa, OK and is simply called Old Hammett Chili Seasoning.</p> 
          <p>Add the meat of your choice and the spice packet (we like ground chuck), you’ll be rewarded with a batch of hearty, bold, Oklahoma style chili. It’s assertively spiced and leaves a pleasant mild “after glow”. We didn’t feel the need to add anything in terms of hot sauce or other spices, and served it over elbow noodles chili mac style. Fantastic!</p> 
          <p>Also check out the recipes at the Old Hammett website for other uses like enchilada sauce and chili party dip. A winner direct from The Sooner State! You can buy it in either two ounce or ten ounce bags and case lots …</p>

They start with Mild, and progress through Warm, Medium, Hot, and “Exxtreme” which is made with habaneros and ghost peppers. Each of the salsas listed at their online store describes which peppers are used, so you can dial directly into your personal heat preference …</p> 
          <p>A &amp; J also make a line of Pepper Relishes that we’re happy to tell you about. They’re great on hot dogs, burgers, sandwiches, and in any recipe where you’d use relish or chow chow.

          </div><b>Southern Okie</b>: Owner and founder Gina Hollingsworth started Southern Okie from the ground up. After moving to Oklahoma with her husband, Gina began selling her gourmet fruit spreads at a local holiday market and was overwhelmed with the positive response. Soon after, she began producing and marketing her products as a full time small business and they are now found in stores all over The Sooner State and beyond …
          <p></p> 
          <p><a href="http://www.southernokie.com" target="_blank">Southern Okie</a> offers four different fruit spreads. While you can use them similar to a standard jam or jelly, they really shine in recipes. Pound cake, tarts, and cobbler recipes are available on their website, but the uses include pairing with main courses as well. The company makes Apple, Pumpkin, Peach, and Pear Fruit Spreads, so think pork roasts, ribs, chicken, baked beans, and more!</p> 
          <p>One recipe really caught our attention … it’s for a slow cooker pork roast with a jar of Gourmet Apple Spread. Add in one package of onion soup mix and let the slow cooker do its thing! The combination of fruity apple with the slow cooked pork is ideal for pulled pork sandwiches …</p> 
          <p>You can buy any of Southern Okie’s gourmet fruit spreads directly at their website. Combination and gift packs are available too!</p>

          <p>Raw honey, as you may know, offers many health benefits and is ideal for a quick burst of energy, especially when taken before or after exercise. A tablespoon of raw unpasteurized honey like Cheatwood’s taken after lunch will help combat the drowsy feeling people often experience mid afternoon …</p> 
          <p>Honey is also great for baking – it lends a sweet, distinctive flavor and because it retains moisture, it helps baked goods remain fresh and moist. You can generally substitute honey in place of sugar in most recipes and enjoy a healthier taste!</p>
