          <p></p> 
          <p>We are big fans of their NW Elixirs Verde Hott #2 sauce – it’s a wonderfully flavorful serrano and jalapeno pepper based sauce that’s flavored by a bit of cilantro and agave. It pairs perfectly with any Mexican style dish and is more than versatile enough to pair with pork, chicken, and fish. We’ve used it with carnitas as well as brushed onto pan roasted chicken – it has a kick of heat but can be used liberally!</p> 
          <p>If you like things a little hotter, try their Hott Sauce #1, a habanero based creation, or the Bangkok #4, made with Thai chiles, lemongrass, garlic, and coriander (ideal for stirfrys!). There’s also a more mild Hott Smoke #3, a chipotle, ancho chile, and smoked onion grilling sauce which can be used as a substitute for barbecue sauce. We love the flavors in this one too!</p> 
          <p>There’s a link at the <a href="http://www.nwelixirs.com" target="_blank">NW Elixirs website</a> on the Order Now page where you can order any or all of their sauces at their online store at IBurn.com .
