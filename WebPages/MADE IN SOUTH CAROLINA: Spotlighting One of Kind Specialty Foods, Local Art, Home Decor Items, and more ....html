Benne is an African word for sesame, and that’s what these wafers essentially are – sesame seed cookies.

After all, they’ve been making and selling them since 1940!</p> 
          <p>In addition to their specialty wafers, the company also makes a cheesy version, which is similar to a cheese straw but in a wafer shape. Carolina Key Lime Cookies, Lemon Snaps, and Peach Pecan Cookies are just a few of their other South Carolina style treats …</p>

          <p>All of the sides are top notch and it doesn’t end with barbecue – Melvin’s was awarded America’s Best Cheeseburger accolades by none other than famed chef Emeril Lagasse. High praise indeed!</p>

          <p>Here at State Gifts USA, you’ll find us talking a lot about sea salt and how it has replaced traditional salt and many other seasonings as our finishing salt of choice. Sea salt is very concentrated, so a small amount will do and better still, it’s a truly local product. At <a href="http://www.bullsbaysaltworks.com" target="_blank">Bulls Bay Salt Works</a>, the entire process is natural. Solar and wind power crystallizes salt which is evaporated from sea water in Bulls Bay, immediately north of Charleston. During summer, the salt is moved to a greenhouse where higher temperatures remove any remaining moisture before packaging …</p> 
          <p>It’s a true culinary experience to discover different sea salts from coastal areas of the United State. Every one we’ve sampled has been outstanding – and unique. Like wine or honey, the unique flavors emanate from the local terroir – in this case the sea water off the South Carolina coast.</p> 
          <p>You can find Bulls Bay Salt Works directly at their website. Currently, four varieties are available – Charleston Sea Salt, Smoked Sea Salt, Carolina Flake, and Carolina Margarita Salt.</p>

          </div><b>Blenheim Ginger Ale</b>: Legendary in South Carolina and with ginger ale purists everywhere, Blenheim Ginger Ale dates back to the late 1800’s. It has been bottled since 1903, and the plant is now adjacent to the famous South of the Border complex, so named because it sits immediately south of the North Carolina – South Carolina border …
          <p></p> 
          <p>Blenheim makes three varieties of ginger ale. The first is Old #3, a spicy taste bud tingling ginger ale that has been a favorite for generations. If you like a crisp soft drink where you can really taste the ginger, try Blenheim’s! </p> 
          <p>The second is the #5, and it’s slightly less intense than the original, but still with ample ginger taste. The third is #9, which is Blenheim Diet Ginger Ale, with the same great taste but less sugar …</p> 
          <p>The Blenheim plant offers tours, so if you’re ever in the area, plan to spend some time at South of the Border and visiting Blenheim. You can buy their ginger ale online at the <a href="http://www.blenheimgingerale.com" target="_blank">Blenheim Ginger Ale</a> website, where you can also pick up some t-shirts and other logo swag … </p>

          </div><b>Charleston Sweetgrass Baskets</b>: Sweetgrass is a tall, thin plant found in abundance in the South Carolina coastal area. It has a sweet smell (hence the name) and has been used to make field baskets for over 400 years by the Charleston area’s traditional basket weavers …
          <p></p> 
          <p>By “field baskets”, we refer to the tradition of using sweetgrass baskets to gather corn, rice, and other crops from the fields. The art of making baskets from sweetgrass is a tradition passed from generation to generation and is one of the most long standing African traditions still active in America …</p> 
          <p>Now, these beautiful baskets like the one shown can be used in the traditional manner or for storage and display art. Because of the sweet smell, the baskets can also be used to refresh the air. Very rare outside of South Carolina, you can now purchase hand woven sweetgrass baskets online at <a href="http://www.charlestonsweetgrass.com" target="_blank">Charleston Sweetgrass Baskets</a>. Dozens of unique designs are available, as well as one of a kind sweetgrass purses.</p> 
          <p>These are distinctive gifts from South Carolina and to our knowledge not available in any other state. Share the pride and tradition of a hand woven sweetgrass basket with someone on your gift list! </p>
