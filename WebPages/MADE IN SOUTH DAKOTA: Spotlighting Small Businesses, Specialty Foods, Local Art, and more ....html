          <p>The Par-T-Pump is a hand made life like representation of a traditional old field pump jack commonly used in oil fields throughout the world. But here’s the ingenious twist – the Par-T-Pump doesn’t pump oil, it holds a half gallon of your favorite hard liquor and pumps out a perfectly measured shot with each stroke!</p> 
          <p>The perfect gift idea for a home bar or anyone who appreciates fine craftsmanship, the Par-T-Pump is meticulously constructed with a solid wood base in your choice of walnut, oak, or maple. The pump jack is assembled by hand and can be customized in your choice of three paint colors. You can even further customize with an engraved name plate and lettered beam …</p> 
          <p>The original idea for the Par-T-Pump resulted from Bud creating a miniature oil well pumpjack from his wife’s alarm clock for the grandkids. Their dad, who owns a lounge, suggested creating a version that’d dispense whiskey or other spirits, and Bud accepted the challenge. The end result is a one of a kind product and thriving South Dakota internet based business …</p>

You can see the spices within the sauce, with big flakes of pepper and more. It’s got a bit of brown sugar in there (according to our taste buds) so if you like a touch of sweet with your Q sauces, like we do, this one is for you!</p> 
          <p>Their website isn’t all that much, but there are a few testimonials, including one from legendary rocker Ted Nugent. Maybe this sauce is “Just What The Doctor Ordered” for Terrible Ted! Regardless, you can order Ol’ West BBQ Sauce on their site in 20 ounce bottles and gallon jugs. Enjoy! </p>
