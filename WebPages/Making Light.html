    “We are prophets of a future not our own.” (Oscar Romero)

   <p> “Young men and women, educated very carefully to be apolitical, to be technicians who thought they disliked politics, making them putty in the hands of their rulers, like always.” (Kim Stanley Robinson, <em>Red Mars)</em> </p>
   <p> “The poor have been rebels, but they have never been anarchists; they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government. The poor man really has a stake in the country. The rich man hasn’t; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht. The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly; the rich have always objected to being governed at all. Aristocrats were always anarchists.” (G. K. Chesterton, <em>The Man Who Was Thursday)</em> </p>
   <p> “When liberty is mentioned, we must observe whether it is not really the assertion of private interests.” (Hegel) </p>

   <p> “I grieve for the spirit of Work, killed by her evil child, Workflow.” (Paul Ford) </p>
   <p> “The opposite of ‘serious’ isn't ‘funny.’ The opposite of both ‘serious’ and ‘funny’ is ‘squalid.’” (R. A. Lafferty) </p>
   <p> “Ki is, of course, mystical bullshit. That’s why it works so well, both as a teaching idiom and a tool of practice in martial arts. It’s as nonexistent as charm, leadership, or acting. Humans are all about bullshit.” (Andrew Plotkin) </p>
   <p> “We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life, when all that we need to make us happy is something to be enthusiastic about.” (Charles Kingsley) </p>

   <p> “Always side with the truth. It’s much bigger than you are.” (Teresa Nielsen Hayden) </p>

   <p> “You will never love art well, until you love what she mirrors better.” (John Ruskin) </p>
   <p> “Having a smallpox vaccine scar is like walking around with the moon landing and the Sistine Chapel on your upper arm.” (Angus Johnston) </p>

   <p> “A socialist is just someone who is unable to get over his or her astonishment that most people who have lived and died have spent lives of wretched, fruitless, unremitting toil.” (Terry Eagleton) </p>
   <p> “But this kind of deference, this attentive listening to every remark of his, required the words he uttered to be worthy of the attention they excited—a wearing state of affairs for a man accustomed to ordinary human conversation, with its perpetual interruption, contradiction, and plain disregard. Here everything he said was right; and presently his spirits began to sink under the burden.” (Patrick O’Brian, <em>Master and Commander)</em> </p>
   <p> “Hatred is a banquet until you recognize you are the main course.” (Herbert Benson) </p>
   <p> “For a Westerner to trash Western culture is like criticizing our nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere on the grounds that it sometimes gets windy, and besides, Jupiter’s is much prettier. You may not realize its advantages until you’re trying to breathe liquid methane.” (Neal Stephenson) </p>

   <p> “I’m a fuzzy-headed warm-hearted liberal, and I think fuzzy-headed warm-hearted liberalism is an ideological stance that needs defending—if necessary, with a hob-nailed boot-kick to the bollocks of budding totalitarianism.” (Charles Stross) </p>
   <p> “The real test of any claim about freedom, I’ve decided, is how far you’re willing to go in letting people be wrong about it.” (Bruce Baugh) </p>

   <p> “The Reign of Sin is more universal, the influence of unconscious error is less, than historians tell us.” (Lord Acton) </p>
   <p> “All human progress, even in morals, has been the work of men who have doubted the current moral values, not of men who have whooped them up and tried to enforce them.” (H. L. Mencken) </p>
   <p> “Tomorrow never happens. It’s all the same fucking day, man.” (Janis Joplin) </p>
   <p> “Words are always getting conventionalized to some secondary meaning. It is one of the works of poetry to take the truants in custody and bring them back to their right senses.” (W. B. Yeats) </p>
   <p> “It is a little embarrassing that, after 45 years of research and study, the best advice I can give to people is to be a little kinder to each other.” (Aldous Huxley) </p>
   <p> “Never believe in a meritocracy in which no one is funny-looking.” (Teresa Nielsen Hayden) </p>
   <p> “Probably no man has ever troubled to imagine how strange his life would appear to himself if it were unrelentingly assessed in terms of his maleness; if everything he wore, said, or did had to be justified by reference to female approval [...] If he gave an interview to a reporter, or performed any unusual exploit, he would find it recorded in such terms as these: ‘Professor Bract, although a distinguished botanist, is not in any way an unmanly man. He has, in fact, a wife and seven children. Tall and burly, the hands with which he handles his delicate specimens are as gnarled and powerful as those of a Canadian lumberjack, and when I swilled beer with him in his laboratory, he bawled his conclusions at me in a strong, gruff voice that implemented the promise of his swaggering moustache.’” (Dorothy L. Sayers) </p>
   <p> “Grown ups are what’s left when skool is finished.” (Nigel Molesworth) </p>
   <p> “If you don't like the ‘blame game,’ it’s usually because you’re to blame.” (Jon Stewart) </p>
   <p> “Slang is for a war of signals.” (Unknown semiotician/palindromist) </p>
   <p> “Science fiction is an argument with the world. When it becomes (solely) an argument within science fiction, it breathes recycled air.” (Ken MacLeod) </p>
   <p> “I really don’t know what you do about the ‘taxes is theft’ crowd, except possibly enter a gambling pool regarding just how long after their no-tax utopia comes true that their generally white, generally entitled, generally soft and pudgy asses are turned into thin strips of Objectivist Jerky by the sort of pitiless sociopath who is actually prepped and ready to live in the world that logically follows these people’s fondest desires.” (John Scalzi) </p>
   <p> “So whenever a libertarian says that capitalism is at odds with the state, laugh at him. It’s like saying that the NFL is ‘at war’ with football fields. To be a libertarian is to say that God or the universe marked up that field, squirted out the pigskins from the bowels of the earth, and handed down the playbooks from Mt. Sinai.” (Connor Kilpatrick) </p>
   <p> “True religion invites us to become better people. False religion tells us that this has already occurred.” (Abdal-Hakim Murad) </p>
   <p> “Power always thinks it has a great soul and vast views, beyond the comprehension of the weak.” (John “Second US President” Adams) </p>
   <p> “There is a document that records God’s endless, dispiriting struggle with organized religion, known as the Bible.” (Terry Eagleton) </p>
   <p> “There comes a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part, you can’t even passively take part; and you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop, And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, the people who own it, that unless you’re free the machine will be prevented from working at all.” (Mario Savio) </p>
   <p> “Racism is not merely a simplistic hatred. It is, more often, broad sympathy toward some and broader skepticism toward others.” (Ta-Nehisi Coates) </p>
   <p> “To live is to war against the trolls.” (Henrik Ibsen) </p>
   <p> “There is at the back of all our lives an abyss of light, more blinding and unfathomable than any abyss of darkness; and it is the abyss of actuality, of existence, of the fact that things truly are, and that we are ourselves incredibly and sometimes almost incredulously real.” (G. K. Chesterton) </p>
   <p> “Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.” (Rainer Maria Rilke) </p>
   <p> “It’s just a ride and we can change it any time we want. It’s only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings and money, a choice right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one.” (Bill Hicks) </p>
   <p> “I don’t think we have a language, will ever have a language, that can describe transcendence in any useful way and I am aware that that transcendence may be nothing more than the illusory aspiration of a decaying piece of meat on a random rock. The thing is to be humble enough to be content with that while acting to other people as generously as if better things were true, and making art as if it might survive and do good in the world. Because what else are we going to do with the few short years of our life?” (Roz Kaveney) </p>
   <p> “I hate living in a satirical dystopia.” (Arthur Hlavaty) </p>
   <p> “No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” (Samuel Beckett) </p>
   <p> “Fuck every cause that ends in murder and children crying.” (Iain Banks) </p>
   <p> “If it doesn’t connect with people around you who aren’t like you, it isn’t politics.” (Teresa Nielsen Hayden) </p>

     <p> Reading about all the people venturing that maybe it would be better to stop the social distancing and reopen the businesses, because tHe dAmAge tO tHe EcOnoMy is So mUcH wOrSe thAn A fEw MiLliOn dEaThS. As someone on Twitter put it, “throwing millions of people into a volcano to appease the Market God.” </p>
     <p> I find myself remembering all the times I’ve heard people in the science fiction world, including eminent authors, muse that it would probably be for the best to have some big die-off events. I suspect that at least one in three Americans believes this. I suspect I have friends and colleagues who quietly believe this. </p>
     <p> I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel surrounded by ghouls. </p>

     <p>So now the rest of the world is discovering virtual communities. I’m feeling very hipster; we were doing it before it was cool.</p> 
     <p>What are some of your favorite resources? I want to point out Jo Walton’s <a href="https://www.patreon.com/projectdecameron">Decameron project</a> on Patreon (free, but contributions encouraged) and Ada Palmer’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SomethingBeautiful">#SomethingBeautiful</a> hashtag on Twitter.</p> 
     <p>As they say here in the Netherlands, <em>sterkte</em>, strength, in these difficult days. May we flatten the curve by sheer force of love. May wisdom dwell in the roofs of our mouths and slip out of our sleeves onto our keyboards. May we love what’s lost and love what is to come. May we repair what breaks, make it better than before. May we go ever onward.</p>

     <p> I largely gave up political blogging after November 8, 2016, when it became obvious that I have no idea what I’m talking about. I still don’t think anyone should pay any attention to what I think. </p>
     <p> If you’re still reading, here are some of the things I recently thought were smart. Keep in mind that I’m an idiot. </p>
     <p> <a href="https://bostonreview.net/politics/eitan-hersh-politics-power-not-consumption">Politics is for Power, Not Consumption</a>, by Eitan Hersh. The bullshit performative stuff we do online isn’t politics, it’s just cosplay. “If you feel unfulfilled, melancholy, paralyzed by the sadness of the news and depth of our political problems, there is an alternative: actually doing politics. Citizens who want to empower their political values would be better off if they spent less time consuming politics as at-home amateurs and instead fell in line to help strengthen organizations and leaders. Rather than kibitzing with their social media friends, they could adopt some of the spirit of the party regulars, counting votes and building interpersonal relationships in their neighborhoods.” </p>
     <p> <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathansmucker/status/1132745954573127680">Twitter thread</a> by Jonathan Smucker, author of <a href="https://www.akpress.org/hegemonyhowto.html"><i>Hegemony How-To: A Roadmap for Radicals</i></a>, which I’m reading and which is so far very good. “Being right wins you exactly nothing if you have no power.” “If you don’t choose your battles, your opponents will choose them for you.” “Revelations of misdeeds of the powerful induce only popular resignation if there is no viable counter-power to take advantage of the opening.” <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathansmucker/status/1132745954573127680">More</a>. </p>
     <p> Jane McAlevey, <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/11/thanksgiving-organizing-activism-friends-family-conversation-presidential-election">How to Organize Your Friends and Family on Thanksgiving</a>. Step by step, how to talk to normal human beings without being the sanctimonious leftist prick everybody hates. Not coincidentally, written by a brilliant modern union organizer. I’m reading her <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/no-shortcuts-9780190624712?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><i>No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age</i></a> and it’s terrific. </p>
     <p> <a href="https://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/interviews/take-roses-seriously-talking-nathan-j-robinson/">We Have to Take the Roses Seriously: Talking to Nathan J. Robinson</a>. Interview with the very smart editor and publisher of the wonderfully-named <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org"><i>Current Affairs</i></a>, whose <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/12/the-power-of-anarchist-analysis">writing</a> I’ve been generally bingeing on. “That great Terry Eagleton quote comes to mind, describing a socialist as ‘just someone who is unable to get over his or her astonishment that most people who have lived and died have spent lives of wretched, fruitless, unremitting toil.’ So I’d begin from that kind of disgust with certain features of the world, certain things that happen to some of us, certain ways that workers get treated. If we can agree that people should meaningfully participate in the decisions that affect their lives, then ‘Do you like the fact that if you drop below packing some set number of boxes per hour, a robot will fire you?’ they probably would say: ‘No, that’s not a process I personally would have established.’” </p>
     <p> Hoping for hope. Happy new year. </p>

     <p> Just posted to <a href="http://www.slate.com">Slate</a>, by Isaac Butler: <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/11/john-ford-science-fiction-fantasy-books.html">The Disappearance of John M. Ford</a>. </p>
     <p> Key takeaway to Making Light readers who remember John M. “Mike” Ford’s <a href="https://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008033.html">brilliant run</a> as a co-blogger here: Tor will, indeed, be reissuing all of Mike’s novels, plus a new collection of short fiction and marginalia. We’ll also be publishing, for the first time, his unfinished final novel <i>Aspects</i>. </p>
     <p> Huge thanks to the Ford family and to Tor executive editor Beth Meacham, who worked out this deal over the space of nearly a year. We could not possibly be more excited. </p>
     <p> The program will begin with <i>The Dragon Waiting</i> in late 2020, then <i>Aspects</i> in early 2021. </p>
     <p> Obviously, this program will not include Mike’s work written inside somebody else’s IP, such as, for instance, his two <i>Star Trek</i> novels. </p>
     <p> Further schedule details will be forthcoming as we finalize them. </p>

    <div class="blogbody"> <a name="016635"></a> <span class="title">Hot times in the British Parliament</span> <span class="posted"><a href="https://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/016635.html#016635"><br> Posted by Teresa at 05:37 AM * 122 comments</a></span> 
     <p> I should be explaining what’s been going on in the British Parliament, with links and explanations. Unfortunately I can’t, because Patrick and I spent the evening talking about it, finding bits of good stuff to read aloud to each other, and cooking and eating dinner. This was irresponsible of us, because how often does one get to use the word “prorogue”? </p>
     <p> What’s going on: Boris Johnson is trying to drag the UK through a (“catastrophic”, says anyone sensible) hard Brexit departure, the kind where there are no arrangements between the UK and the EU about how to handle this change. He also thought that in the meantime, it would be a good idea to prorogue Parliament — that is, get Parliament to shut down and do no business — until after the hard exit was a done deal. </p>
     <p> I wasn’t the first person to observe that the last guy who went to that much trouble to keep Parliament from doing business lost his head. </p>
     <p> Then Parliament rebelled. Ancient much-respected Tory stalwarts voted against the government, despite the threat to (less exciting than it sounds) “withdraw the whip.” In a dramatic gesture, while Johnson was speaking and waving his arms around, Tory MP Phillip Lee silently walked across the room to sit with the Liberal Democrats, thus costing the Tories their one-vote majority. Johnson was reduced to calling for a snap national election in mid-October, but that actually requires approval by a two-thirds majority, and the leaders of both Labour and the LibDems — who rarely act in such coordination — agreed that they weren’t going to give Johnson his election before Parliament passes a bill ruling out a no-deal exit. It was Boris Johnson’s first serious fight in Parliament, and he lost big. Theresa May was photographed this evening leaving Parliament with a big grin on her face. </p>
     <p> I abjectly apologize for being so tired, but Patrick kept finding one irresistible story, after another. Feel free to post links to anything good that you find. I’ll see you first thing in the morning. </p>
     <p> [Update from pnh: Teresa was in fact so tired that she didn’t actually publish this last night. Posting it for her now.] </p>

     <p> Nobody reads this blog any more. But do read <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2019/08/03/rituals-of-childhood/">Kieran Healy</a>.</p>
     <blockquote>
      A fundamental lesson of Sociology is that, in the course of making everyday life seem orderly and sensible, arbitrary things are made to seem natural and inevitable. Rituals, especially the rituals of childhood, are a powerful way to naturalize arbitrary things. As a child in Ireland, I thought it natural to take the very body of Christ in the form of a wafer of bread on my tongue. My own boy and girl, in America, think it natural that a school is a place where you must know what to do when someone comes there to kill the children.
     </blockquote>As we used to wearily say back in the day: Read the fucking rest.

     <p>The year 222 BCE saw the Roman Emperor Elagabalus assassinated by the Praetorian Guard, to be replaced by Alexander Severus, who was only 13 years old, young enough to have attended Hogwarts and studied potions under a teacher with whom he had a name in common. </p> 
     <p>Or, alternatively, to have attended the fictional Walt Whitman High School in Los Angeles, where he might have learned about the assassination of his predecessor in a history class in Room 222. </p>

     <p> </p>
     <p>It’s been a long time since I’ve posted a new entry to this community, and I know the comments on the last one have gotten unworkably long. I’m sorry. You deserve better.</p> 
     <p>There’s been stuff. There still is stuff. I’ll explain in the comments.</p> 
     <p>But I’d just like to point out that even with my highly intermittent presence, this community has continued, and continued to be a wonderful thing.</p> 
     <p>I’ll continue to be back as I can. But it fills me with so much delight to see the egg I hatched, the hatchling I fed, grow wings, spread them, and fly.</p> 
     <hr> 
     <p>This is part of the sequence of Dysfunctional Families discussions. We have a few special rules, specific to the needs and nature of the conversations we have here.</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>If you want to participate but don’t want your posts linked to your contributions to the rest of Making Light, feel free to choose a pseudonym. But please keep it consistent within these threads, because people do care. You can create a separate (view all by) history for your pseudonym by changing your email address. And if you blow it and cross identities, give me a shout and I’ll come along and tidy it up.</li> 
      <li>On a related note, please respect the people’s choice to use a pseudonym, unless they make it clear that they are willing to let the identities bleed over in people’s minds.</li> 
      <li> If you’re not from a dysfunctional background, be aware that your realities and base expectations are not the default in this conversation. In particular, please don’t do the “they’re the only family you have” thing. Black is white, up is down, and your addressee’s mother may very well be their nemesis.</li> 
      <li> Be even more careful, charitable, and gentle than you would elsewhere on Making Light. Try to avoid “helpiness”/”hlepiness” (those comments which look helpful, but don’t take account of the addressee’s situation and agency). Apologize readily and sincerely if you tread on toes, even unintentionally. This kind of conversation only works because people have their defenses down.</li> 
      <li>Never underestimate the value of a good witness. If you want to be supportive but don’t have anything specific to say, people do value knowing that they are heard.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <p>Previous posts (note that comments are closed on them to keep the conversation in one place):</p>
