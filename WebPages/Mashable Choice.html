Beats' Powerbeats Pro and Samsung's Galaxy Buds are two of the most popular options.\nBut as well-reviewed as they are, neither have noise cancelation. Sony's unfortunately named \"WF-1000XM3 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones\" (can we get an easier to remember name?) do and sound way better than AirPods as a result.\nSEE ALSO: The best tech of 2019 (so far)\nThe tradeoffs to superior sound quality, however, are price ($229 versus AirPods, which start at $159) and a large charging case.\nIf neither of these are deal-breakers for you, Sony's WF-1000XM3 are easily the best true wireless earbuds released this year.\nDeep fit in your ears\n\nKudos to Sony for not making a blatant AirPods knockoff, complete with stems. The flat, oblong design of the WF-1000XM3, available in silver with gold accents or black with copper trims, is handsome and doesn't attract much attention, which I really appreciate.\nHead-on, the WF-1000XM3 still look a little goofy — something we just have to accept with true wireless earbuds — but at least they're not chunky like the Bose SoundSport Free.\n\nEach of the WF-1000XM3 earbuds comes with a touchpad and using them is pretty straightforward.\nThe left one is for switching between sound modes: regular, noise cancelation, ambient, and quick attention. And the right touchpad is for music controls: single-tap to play/pause, double-tap to skip to next track, and triple-tap to return to previous track. A tap-and-hold on the right touchpad activates your phone's digital assistant — Google Assistant on Android and Siri on iPhone.\n\nFor the most part, the touchpads are responsive. If I could add one thing to the earbuds, it would be volume controls. As it stands, the only way to control the volume is on your connected device.\nI should also mention my first review unit was a dud and had a defective right touchpad that wouldn't respond to a single-tap to play and pause music. Sony sent over a new replacement pair and they worked perfectly.\nThe touchpads also don't play nice with wet or sweaty fingers. During runs, I noticed the touchpad controls were hit or miss. When my fingers were dry, the controls worked, but if they were sweaty, not so much. \n\nDesign aside, the top complaint people have with AirPods is that they don't fit well. Maybe the stems stick out or the buds fall out all the time. (Consider trying these AirPods upgrades.) Everyone's ears are different so the fit naturally varies.\nCompared to AirPods, the WF-1000XM3's and their in-ear tips reach deeper into your ears for a snugger fit. Like the Beats Powerbeats Pro, Sony's earbuds have an angled acoustic housing that sits better in your ears' concha bowls.\nIn my tests, the WF-1000XM3's stayed put in my ears and didn't slip out during sweaty runs even though they're not water or sweat resistant.\n\nIncluded in the box are two types of ear tips: silicone and foam, each in three sizes. I found myself preferring the foam tips for their better fit and sound isolation.\nSuperior sound with noise cancelation\n\nAnyone who uses AirPods knows they sound OK — good, but not stellar by any means. True wireless earbuds with in-ear designs like the Powerbeats Pro are better at keeping outside noise from seeping in, but they still let in some ambient sound.\nThe WF-1000XM3's are in a whole other league. With built-in noise cancelation tech — a tap on the left earbud's touchpad turns it on — the earbuds instantly drown out almost all background noise so it's just you and your music.\nWith noise cancelation, I noticed songs sounded warmer, bass felt deeper, and highs were brighter. There's more clarity across all frequencies and I could hear the difference with and without it in noisy places like the streets and subway.\n\nNow, the noise cancelation isn't perfect. You can still hear some ambient noise, especially at volumes below 50 percent. But compared to AirPods or Galaxy Buds, where your music simply can't overpower outside sounds unless you crank the volume up really high, the WF-1000XM3's noise cancelation is as good as it gets on true wireless earbuds.\nIt's not, however, as good as what you get from over-ear headphones with built-in noise cancelation, such as Sony's own best-in-class WH-1000XM3 or Bose's QC 35 II's or new 700 cans. \nDespite the wireless earbuds using a newer version of Sony's noise-cancelation processor, the QN1e, Sony's over-ear noise-canceling headphones are better at blocking external noise because they use four microphones (versus two) to ingest more ambient sound and feed it through the chip to cancel it out.\nOver-ear noise-canceling headphones also have additional sound isolation from the foam-padded cups that cover your whole ear, whereas earbuds don't.\nTwo other big pluses for the WF-1000XM3: 1) There's an ambient sound mode, which is good for when you do want to hear what's happening around you, like when you're biking, and 2) There's a \"Quick Attention Mode\" that turns off noise cancelation when you cover the left earbud, which is useful for times when you don't want to take the buds off.\nLoads of battery life\n\nAfter comfort and sound quality, I was impressed with the WF-1000XM3's long-lasting battery life. It varies based on what sound mode you have them set to. \nWith noise cancelation turned on, the earbuds last up to 6 hours on a single charge. Turn noise cancelation off, though, and battery life shoots up to 8 hours of music playback.\nHere's how the WF-1000XM3's battery life compares to the best true wireless earbuds:\n\n  WF-1000XM3 (with noise cancelation): 6 hours\n  WF-1000XM3 (without noise cancelation): 8 hours\n  AirPods: 5 hours\n  Galaxy Buds: 6 hours\n  Powerbeats Pro: 9 hours\n\nThe large charging case also adds an impressive number of extra charges:\n\n  WF-1000XM3 (with noise cancelation): 18 hours (3 charges)\n  WF-1000XM3 (without noise cancelation): 24 hours (4 charges)\n  AirPods: 19 hours (3.8 charges)\n  Galaxy Buds: 7 hours (1.2 charge)\n  Powerbeats Pro: 15 hours (1.7 charge)\n\nCompared to my second-gen AirPods, which need to be popped back into their charging case by the middle of the day, the WF-1000XM3's often lasted entire 9-5 workdays (without noise cancelation) before needing a recharge.\nAs excellent as the battery life is, the charging case is my least favorite thing about the WF-1000XM3. It's huge — about twice the size of an AirPods case — and doesn't fit in my pockets without bulging out. \n\nThe case size isn't an issue if you stash it in a jacket pocket or purse, and you can make the argument that the Powerbeats Pro's massive clamshell case is even worse, but that doesn't change the fact Sony could have made the case smaller.\nI'm sympathetic to the fact that the larger case also means more stored charges, but I would much rather have a slightly smaller case with maybe one less charge so that it fits in my jeans.\nEverything AirPods aren't — in a good way\n\nSony may not be the consumer electronics king it was in the '90s, but one thing it still knows how to make are class-leading headphones.\nLike its WH-1000XM3 over-ear noise-cancelation headphones, the WF-1000XM3's exceeded my expectations. They fit really well, sound amazing thanks to noise cancelation, and last seemingly forever. What more could you want from true wireless earbuds? \nSure, the charging case is big, you can't pair the earbuds to multiple devices like you can with AirPods, and they cost $70 more. But if you want one of the best-sounding true wireless earbuds around, you'll have to gloss over these mostly minor drawbacks.\nWATCH: Sony’s WF-1000XM3 are AirPods with noise

But did you know it's now branching off into e-scooters?\nAnnounced in May, Boosted has started shipping its new Rev electric scooter, and — oh man — does it put all other consumer e-scooters to shame.\nLike its electric longboards and skateboards, Boosted is quick to remind people that the Rev is not a toy, but a serious vehicle. \nThe Rev isn't a regular scooter with an electric motor and battery strapped to it. Everything, from the hefty frame to the fat wheels to dual motors were custom-designed to tackle the unpredictable streets and make riding safer.\nSEE ALSO: The Boosted Mini is the best electric skateboard for everyone\nI've ridden my fair share of e-scooters, from the likes of Lime and Bird and Bolt, and while they're undoubtedly convenient and fun for zipping around town, their biggest weakness is that they're not very safe to ride. A helmet is a must for riding an e-scooter, but it does nothing for actually making the scooter itself safer. \nThis is largely because most scooter-sharing systems use some variant of Xiaomi's Mi Electric Scooter, which is inexpensive to modify and deploy, but hardly the best when it comes to things like safety features such as stability and wheel traction.\nThe Rev, however, is arguably the safest e-scooter I've ever ridden and worth the $1,599 price if you intend for it to be your primary and daily mode of transportation. Note: The Rev I tested was a pre-production version and I didn't experience faults with the folding latch that other reviewers did.\nBuilt like a tank\nCompared to scooter rentals, the Boosted Rev is a tank; it's intentionally larger and bulkier for superior riding performance. \nThe frame is made of strong 6000-series aluminum and feels as high quality as Boosted's electric boards, if not more premium. I had my doubts about the bulky metal design, but came around to it as soon as I rode it down the first few rocky blocks in my neighborhood.\nReally, Lime or Bird e-scooters seem wimpy next to the Rev. The handlebar is wider and less cramped, the platform deck is more spacious and lower to the ground for better stability, and the steering tube feels sturdier. \n\nThere are a couple of features on the handlebar. In the center, there's an LCD screen for displaying the scooter's speed, battery life, and riding mode (three in total). A single button switches between the different settings and is also used to turn the 400-lumen headlight on and off.\n\nThe handlebar is also home to a throttle wheel on the right and a mechanical disc brake on the left. There's also a tiny bell on the left bar — something I completely missed until Boosted told me it was there.\n\nThe Rev easily folds up for transport. But at 46 pounds, it's not an e-scooter you can carry around with one hand if your arms are weak. Just for comparison's sake, Xiaomi's Mi scooter weighs 27 pounds.\nBoosted's industrial design might seem excessive to anyone looking at a dinky $500 e-scooter, but the company's CEO Jeff Russkaow told me the Rev will be able to endure years of punishing riding, whereas cheaper e-scooters are more likely to break down (wheels fall off, brakes fail, power drive weakens).\nGlides right over bumpy roads\n\nSize aside, the Rev is an absolute joy to ride around on. Whereas a scooter rental always feels semi wobbly — like its wheels could fall off during top acceleration or the steering column could loosen — the Rev feels secure.\nThe lower deck provides more stability and the thicker wheels hug the ground better compared to cheaper e-scooters. These intentional designs are key to smoother riding, especially on busted streets and roads, where any crack or pothole could send you flying through the air (it happened to me earlier in the month while riding a Lime e-scooter in Portland).\nA more stable riding experience is even more important when you're pushing the Rev's acceleration  to its 24 mph max speed; Xiaomi's Mi e-scooter tops out at 15.5 mph.\n\nWhen going that fast, you want an e-scooter that can grip the asphalt, and grip really well the Rev does. I never once felt like I wasn't in control while riding. Compare that to other flimsier e-scooters where I'm always bracing myself for a potential accident.\nThe Rev comes with three riding modes: 1, 2, and 3. Each mode has a capped speed suited for people with beginner, intermediate, and advanced riding experience. I mostly rode in mode 1 and topped out at upper 12-14 mile speed limit on New York City's traffic-filled streets. But on a clear and mostly pedestrian-free bike path in a park, I definitely dialed the speed up to 20 mph and higher a couple of times. \nAt no point did I ever feel like the Rev would ever spin out, even at 20 mph. How good of a balance you have will of course affect how much of a learning curve there will be, but for me, it handled like a beast.\nHi pretty @BoostedBoards Rev pic.twitter.com/TVtEV2l8NC— Raymond Wong📱💾📼 (@raywongy) July 17, 2019\n\nI even rode the scooter up and down short grassy hills (above) without any issues whatsoever thanks to its 25 percent grade hill climbing. In Portland, the puny Lime e-scooter I rented couldn't even get up a steep street.\nRange anxiety is also something you don't have to worry with the Rev. Boosted advertises the Rev with as capable of going up to 22 miles. To put that into perspective, the Boosted Mini S has a 7-mile range, the Boosted Plus and Stealth electric longboards have a 14-mile range, and Xiaomi's Mi e-scooter has an 18.6-mile range.\n\nTo me, the feature I love the most on the Rev is its three brakes. There's the mechanical disc brake on the handlebar that I mentioned, an electric regenerative brake activated by pulling to the right on the throttle wheel, and a manual stomp brake above the back wheel.\nThough I said I felt in complete control of the Rev, the three brakes helped put my mind at ease. In the beginning, the regenerative electric brake slowed a little too abruptly so I tended to reach for the disc brake or stomp brake. After a few minutes of riding, the I quickly transitioned to braking with the throttle wheel. With three ways to brake, I always knew I had a way to stop the machine at any moment.\nBottom line: the Rev is really fun to ride (with a helmet of course). It also charges up quickly in three hours and connects via Bluetooth to the Boosted app to keep track of speed, range, and battery (all the things you can track with Boosted electric boards).\nQuickly pays for itself\n\nMany of my friends and colleagues were in sticker shock when I told them the Rev costs $1,599. And yes, it's a lot of money to spend on an electric scooter when compared to the many $500 (and under) e-scooters such as Xiaomi's Mi Electric Scooter that are available.\nBut the Rev's price tag really is no different compared to the same-priced Boosted Stealth electric longboard. You're paying more for better durability, performance, and safety. \nThe Rev is meant to be an alternative mode of transportation. I can see how it maybe makes less financial sense if, say, your commute to work involves taking a train and then e-scootering the last leg from the station.\nHowever, if you're riding the Rev in place of the train or a car, the e-scooter pays itself off pretty quickly. For instance, if I lived in Manhattan instead of far out in Queens, I'd for sure get one of these babies to get around the city instead of forking up $127 per month for a 30-day unlimited MetroCard, which totals up to $1,547 a year. I'd save over $3,000 over the following two years (and countless more until the battery deteriorates). \nA full payment for the Rev might be too expensive to pony up for all at once so consider Boosted's financing plans (though it comes with APR).\nThe Rev's not for everyone — especially the budget-strapped — but if you want the best and safest e-scooter, you gotta make the investment. Most great products don't come cheap.\nUPDATE: July 22, 2019, 12:59 p.m. EDT: Clarified that we tested a pre-production Boosted Rev and didn't experience any design faults other reviewers did.\nWATCH: The Boosted Mini S is the electric skateboard of your dreams"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1016905%252Fb5215c74-ccc7-4041-aeb3-674ca23f38fd.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=-EvkhX9ctk2uhrGfbr8VukEOSb0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99616%252Ff44e0de9-4e0c-47e4-ba7a-1eec34dc0a6f.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=ZOBFphwX6bxx9FE9HfKQTSriQl4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99616%252Ff44e0de9-4e0c-47e4-ba7a-1eec34dc0a6f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ceeAHeVwMe7oqPx9oV9TNIxpQ3E=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99616%252Ff44e0de9-4e0c-47e4-ba7a-1eec34dc0a6f.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=BqwCNJTzwnX4p98Sfq8n-_Q-508=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99616%252Ff44e0de9-4e0c-47e4-ba7a-1eec34dc0a6f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=mnFz8FGqnbOJUwjPuqjTSnP7gf8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99616%252Ff44e0de9-4e0c-47e4-ba7a-1eec34dc0a6f.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=mYTyY5PN6UAZRr70ttXg5tv_SLE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"The Boosted Rev is the best e-scooter you can get.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1016905%252Fb5215c74-ccc7-4041-aeb3-674ca23f38fd.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1016905%252Fb5215c74-ccc7-4041-aeb3-674ca23f38fd.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1016905%252Fb5215c74-ccc7-4041-aeb3-674ca23f38fd.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=8tOfKoFdsZLdnPBwZFfDZYV6f58=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1016905%252Fb5215c74-ccc7-4041-aeb3-674ca23f38fd.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=HX5AgD1Iy1c8xPxBdoybo17OJ0Y=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"The Boosted Rev is the best e-scooter you can get."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  raymond wong / mashable"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"The Boosted Rev is the safest e-scooter to buy (if you can afford it)","choice":true,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"productreview":[{"id":1016604,"data-id":1016604,"data-template":"default","data-product-url":"https://zdcs.link/jJ7L1","data-product-price":"1,599","data-product-name":"Boosted Rev","data-product-good":"Big, thick wheels to tackle streets,Three types of brakes,Tops out at 24 mph,Up to 22-mile range","data-product-bad":"Heavy AF at 46 lbs,3-4x more expensive than other consumer e-scooters","data-product-blurb":"Boosted's first electric scooter is big, heavy, and very fast.

This means that your face won't be blurred out in photographs taken with a flash, or in standard security camera footage in a well-lit environment. But that doesn't mean the glasses aren't working.\n\"I’m just providing an opt-out because the system is not an opt-in.\" \nThe frames are specifically designed to defeat 3D dot matrix face-mapping systems, which is basically what makes Apple's Face ID work. They bounce infrared light back at its source, with the goal of preventing IR video cameras from getting a good image of your face — or potentially even registering your face as a face at all. \n\"The days of when privacy was equated to criminals is long gone,\" Urban explained over email. \"Now it’s all going to be about corporations/governments using your face to know everything about you and gather all of your data into a neat little profile. I and many others would simply prefer to not be on their system.\"\n\nUrban clearly understands that he's not alone is his concern regarding the creeping pervasiveness of facial-recognition tech. Just this past May, San Francisco voted to ban the local government's use of the technology in response to a demonstrated capacity for error and abuse. \nAs the ACLU put it in an open letter to Amazon's Jeff Bezos imploring the CEO to stop selling its product Rekognition to government agencies, facial-recognition technology promises to track people \"attending a protest, congregating outside a place of worship, or simply living their lives.\"\nThe Phantom frames are a small, but meaningful, way of individually pushing back against that unpleasant future. \n\"I’m just providing an opt-out because the system is not an opt-in,\" continued Urban, \"it’s everywhere and unregulated.\"\nThe Phantom\nTo the casual observer, Phantoms appear to be a standard pair of glasses. They can be fitted with tinted lenses as well as prescription lenses.\nThe new design and focus on infrared light is a reaction to, in Urban's mind, the changing surveillance landscape, especially as more and more mobile phones incorporate facial recognition. \n\nBut it's not just Apple's Face ID that relies on infrared light. Infrared security cameras are ubiquitous. You see them at bars, corner stores, restaurants, parking lots, and on street corners. They typically work by illuminating a dark location with IR LED lights — an effect invisible to the human eye — and then recording the resulting image with a special camera. \nThe Phantom frames are a response to these varying forms of surveillance.\n\"Infrared Radiation (IR) in the forms of 3D dot matrix mapping and laser scanning are the most accurate forms of facial recognition technology and they will soon become the most common,\" Urban writes on his Kickstarter page. \"Phantom [maintains] your privacy on these systems during both day and night. They also obscure your facial data on [more traditional] 2D IR surveillance cameras in low light environments and block IR eye-tracking.\"\nBlocking some forms of eye-tracking is an especially interesting bonus of the glasses, as that technology has been highlighted as particularly invasive by a diverse group ranging from Microsoft to the ACLU.\nAll of this, it should be noted, is going on behind the scenes as far as anyone looking at your shades can tell. By not reflecting visible light, the Phantoms are essentially indistinguishable from a standard pair of glasses to the naked eye. \nThis differs from the Ghost frames which, while stylish, are slightly conspicuous. The pattern and material used to reflect visible light might stand out as a bit of a fashion choice. It should be said, however, that over the several months I tried these glasses out in San Francisco, I didn't feel out of place. \n\nIt's worth noting that the Ghosts are cool. Reflecting visible light has the side effect of screwing with any unexpected flash photography and serves as a bonus safety feature. As an urban cyclist, having car headlights bounce off my face and back at drivers is a great way of reminding them I exist. \nThe Phantoms, on the other hand, are intentionally more subtle. Other than the fact that they are a little wider than traditional glasses frames for technical reasons, no casual observer will be the wiser that you're sporting anti-facial recognition gear. \n\"On traditional IR surveillance cameras, Phantom will illuminate around the eye space, denying algorithms the critical biometrics for a match,\" the product description reads. It adds that with 3D infrared mapping \"the reflected IR beams from Phantom will distort the facial data to maintain your privacy.\"\nYou can test the latter point out yourself (or, if you don't use Face ID, have a friend or coworker do it for you). Wearing the Phantom frames essentially breaks Apple's aforementioned facial-recognition tech, which relies on an \"infrared image of your face.\" \n\nThe Phantom frames also come with the optional IRlenses — lenses that prevent infrared-light cameras from seeing your eyes.  \nThe frames launched, as initially did the Reflectacles, in the form of a Kickstarter. Unveiled in June, the crowd-funding effort quickly surpassed its initial stated goal with a shipping date of April 20, 2020. Once the Kickstarter ends on July 24, customers will be able to pre-order the frames directly from the Reflectacles website for $142.  \nI was sent an early pair of the Phantoms in February, and have worn them to numerous locations around the city that have infrared security cameras. One such location allowed me to view the security footage of a friend wandering around a back stock room while wearing the Phantoms. The room was dark, and his face was slightly obscured on the security monitor. I could still tell it was my friend, but a computer program scanning the footage for a face match might not be so successful because, according to Urban, it may misinterpret the face as a light source. \nNotably, those of you envisioning some form of William Gibson's \"Ugly Shirt\" should slow your roll. Many security cameras these days record some combination of IR light and light on the visible spectrum, meaning the Phantoms don't exactly make you invisible. \nBut that's not really the point. Urban knows that his glasses are not a panacea. With the Ghost, he warns that the distance from the facial-recognition device in question will alter the frames' performance, and that \"more complex cameras with large exposure sensors or off-axis lighting will not have the same effect.\" For their part, the Phantoms are a specific response to a specific surveillance concern — so don't count on them to facilitate your next bank robbery.\nStill, with privacy threatening to become a relic of a forgotten time, those concerned about its impending death have to start pushing back somewhere. Why not here?\n\nUrban emphasized over email that he sees privacy as a universal value that — just like his customer base — transcends the partisan divide. And, importantly, his frames have an impact that's larger than the immediate and personal one. \n\"People who are not hip to privacy may be quick to dismiss a privacy advocate as paranoid, but when they talk [and] have a face-to-face conversation with somebody about privacy and see they are not 'crazy,' it has a direct impact that just can’t be done within an article,\" he wrote.\nIn the end, Phantom frames should be one of many tools in your privacy toolbox. Making privacy the default setting offline as well as on will take time and effort — but you might as well look cool while doing the work.  "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1012365%252F49a97a03-368f-409f-a879-61b9b242bdea.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=V1e3PrUDWoxoEd2FspK7i4IRzQk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=t7swaB7eF1ELmu0pDnlg4F0FImA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F356x205.png?signature=xHPRCq01inmTPsZlRp-ueqnUNWE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F712x410.png?signature=IVmoCkOt8yoPWVxS-yhQTWoDUrA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F280x157.png?signature=PEN62MJtGrPllVLYjTvGM2L1hKY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F560x314.png?signature=Er6_Z68bO7Uu8L4Xa5eeRyeO7Mk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"The Phantom frames.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-review-reflectacles-phantom-anti-facial-recognition-technology-glasses-frames.png","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-review-reflectacles-phantom-anti-facial-recognition-technology-glasses-frames.png","micro":1},"src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1012365%252F49a97a03-368f-409f-a879-61b9b242bdea.png%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=OxGU1AO-q8wqxeqp2IZ5mqr7DIQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1012365%252F49a97a03-368f-409f-a879-61b9b242bdea.png%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=2eaMjAlNj03vNwPtWONb47kVVgA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"The Phantom frames."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Reflectacles"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Fight facial-recognition technology with Phantom glasses","choice":true,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"productreview":[{"id":1012473,"data-id":1012473,"data-template":"default","data-product-url":"null","data-product-price":"null","data-product-name":"undefined","data-product-good":"null","data-product-bad":"null","data-product-blurb":"undefined","data-product-score":"undefined","data-product-coolness":"undefined","data-product-curve":"undefined","data-product-performance":"undefined","data-product-value":"undefined","data-product-score-title":"undefined","data-product-coolness-title":"undefined","data-product-curve-title":"undefined","data-product-performance-title":"undefined","data-product-bang-for-the-buck-title":"undefined","class":"content-productreview"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The specialty glasses are designed to thwart various forms of facial-recognition tech.

All of these are valid reasons to not get AirPods!\nIf you're nodding your head in agreement, I highly recommend the Powerbeats Pro. They've got the same Apple H1 chip technology that gives the AirPods 2 its convenient pairing with Apple devices (iOS and Mac), hands-free Siri voice controls, and long-lasting battery life, but have none of the aforementioned AirPods downsides. \nThe only things that might turn you off are the charging case and price. Compared to AirPods' tiny dental floss-sized charging case, the one for Powerbeats Pro is huge; you won't be fitting it in any skinny jeans. And at $249.95, the Powerbeats command a hefty premium over $159 AirPods.\nFinally cable-free\n\nAt first blush, the Powerbeats Pro look little more than a cable-free version of Beats' popular Powerbeats 3 wireless earbuds.\nBut Beats went beyond simply cutting the cord connecting the two earbuds. The Apple-owned company actually redesigned the sporty wireless earbuds from the ground up for improved comfort and sound quality.\nCompared to Powerbeats 3, the Powerbeats Pro are 23 percent smaller and 17 percent lighter. I've always found the Powerbeats 3 a little on the bulky side so it's nice that the Powerbeats Pro are more compact. Beats also changed the acoustic housing so it's angled and fits better in ears.\n\nAll of these improvements make the Powerbeats Pro more comfortable to wear for hours. But more importantly, they make the earbuds comfier when you're using them while working out or running. \nIt felt great not having a cable flapping around the back of my neck while running with the Powerbeats Pro. I also appreciated the in-ear design that sits deeper in your ears and helps keep them in place. I've never had a problem with AirPods falling out of my ears except in one place: on planes. Every time I nod off on a flight, one of my AirPods always gets knocked outta my ear. With Powerbeats Pro, I knew they would stay securely in place and not slip out thanks to the ear hooks.\nI get that the ear hooks design might not be for everyone, but they feel better than they look. The ear hooks can also be tricky to wrap around your ears at first, but with a little practice, putting them on becomes easier.\nThe wireless earbuds are sorta smart, too, thanks to Apple's H1 chip. As with AirPods, connecting the Powerbeats Pro to an iOS device is as simple as opening the case (Android users will need to go into the Bluetooth settings and manually connect). \n\nSimilarly, you can easily switch between iOS and Mac if you're logged into your iCloud account on the latter. Furthermore, taking one earbud out of your ear automatically pauses the music and putting it back in resumes playback.\n\nOn AirPods, the only way to control the volume is to do so on the device it's connected to or use Siri (who does this?). However, on Powerbeats Pro, there are physical volume buttons on both earbuds and the Beats logo also doubles as a play/pause and Siri activation button (long press). \nOverall, I have no complaints about the Powerbeats Pro earbuds design and features. The have everything that makes AirPods feel \"magical\" and then some.\nBangin' sound quality\nAs much as I love my AirPods, I admit they could sound better. The audio quality is fine — as good as wired EarPods — but they won't knock your socks off if you want high-fidelity audio quality. Their tiny size doesn't leave a whole lot of room for quality drivers that can push out better sound.\nWhile Powerbeats Pro aren't audiophile-grade wireless earbuds by any means, they sound noticeably better than AirPods in my opinion, and not just for bass-heavy music.\nListening to a variety variety of music genres — everything from EDM to classical to hip-hop — I found the Powerbeats Pro produced a wider audio range. Music sounds warmer with more distinguishable mids and highs and the low-end no longer drowns out everything. This improved sound is especially noticeable in a song like Childish Gambino's \"Summertime Magic,\" where the bass doesn't overpower the vocals as much as through AirPods.\n\nBack in the day, Beats headphones were notorious for prioritizing bass over all other frequencies. Those days are over. Beats president Luke Wood told me during a press preview that they now tune their headphones, including the Powerbeats Pro, to sound more like what it does in the recording studio.\nUsing new linear piston drivers, the Powerbeats Pro, produce cleaner sound with less distortion when the volume is cranked up. \nCombined with the tighter sealing from the in-ear tips, the Powerbeats Pro really sound fantastic. The sound quality's also not compromised during workouts or runs.\nBeats has come a really long way from its bass-y days and it's time consumers realize this.\nAll-day battery life\n\nBattery life is another way the Powerbeats Pro are better than AirPods. While I think most people agree AirPods get a respectable five hours of listening time on a single charge, Powerbeats last even longer with up to nine hours of listening from one charge.\nOn several days, I was able to leave them on during entire work days from around 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. before having to pop them back into the charging case. The charging case adds another 15 hours of listening time for a total of 24 hours. \nLike AirPods, the Powerbeats Pro can be quick charged. Beats says this \"Fast Fuel\" charging with a five-minute charge giving you 1.5 hours of music playback and 15 minutes giving you 4.5 hours. In comparison, AirPods get up to three hours with a 15-minute quick charge. It's definitely handy in a pinch!\nNow, about the charging case: It's big. The clam-shaped case is nearly four times larger than the AirPods charging case, which to be fair, is one of the smallest there is for true wireless earbuds.\n\nThe case isn't a problem if you've got a backpack, purse, or jacket pockets to stash it in. But if you like going out with as little as possible in your pockets, you're gonna hate that the case is large. \nAre you supposed to just put the earbuds in your pocket when you wanna take them off? And pray they don't get lost? As somebody who's lost wireless earbuds because I put them in my pockets instead of back into their case, I can say this is not something you wanna do. \n\nLeaving the charging case isn't as big of a deal if you're taking the Powerbeats Pro out for a quick run or workout because the battery lasts pretty long (you're not working out or running for nine straight hours are you?), but if you wanna take them off afterwards, you've got no choice but to hold them in your hands or put them in your pockets. At least with AirPods, the case is small enough to fit in your pocket. \nAirPods or Powerbeats Pro?\n\nSo AirPods or Powerbeats Pro? Personally, I still prefer AirPods because I can't stand the size of the Powerbeats Pro's charging case, but that's just me.\nBut if you can overlook the case because maybe you want better sound quality, a snugger fit, longer battery life, and physical controls, Powerbeats Pro are hard to beat and superior to AirPods. That said, at $250, there are also many wireless earbuds that offer arguably better sound and comparable comfort at similar pricing such as the $300 Master & Dynamic's MW07 or $300 Sennheiser Momentum.\nIf you're a runner or workout a lot, though, the Powerbeats Pro are a no-brainer in my opinion. For sports, Beats' Powerbeats are considered the gold standard, mainly because of battery life and the Powerbeats Pro are no different.\nTruthfully, you can't go wrong with either. Pick the one that works best for you. As with headphones, there's no one-size-fits-all for true wireless earbuds. What works for me might not for you since ears come in different shapes and sizes.\nWATCH: Apple's second-gen AirPods are

choose from. Beats' Powerbeats Pro and Samsung's Galaxy Buds are two of the most popular options.\nBut as well-reviewed as they are, neither have noise cancelation. Sony's unfortunately named \"WF-1000XM3 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones\" (can we get an easier to remember name?) do and sound way better than AirPods as a result.\nSEE ALSO: The best tech of 2019 (so far)\nThe tradeoffs to superior sound quality, however, are price ($229 versus AirPods, which start at $159) and a large charging case.\nIf neither of these are deal-breakers for you, Sony's WF-1000XM3 are easily the best true wireless earbuds released this year.\nDeep fit in your ears\n\nKudos to Sony for not making a blatant AirPods knockoff, complete with stems. The flat, oblong design of the WF-1000XM3, available in silver with gold accents or black with copper trims, is handsome and doesn't attract much attention, which I really appreciate.\nHead-on, the WF-1000XM3 still look a little goofy — something we just have to accept with true wireless earbuds — but at least they're not chunky like the Bose SoundSport Free.\n\nEach of the WF-1000XM3 earbuds comes with a touchpad and using them is pretty straightforward.\nThe left one is for switching between sound modes: regular, noise cancelation, ambient, and quick attention. And the right touchpad is for music controls: single-tap to play/pause, double-tap to skip to next track, and triple-tap to return to previous track. A tap-and-hold on the right touchpad activates your phone's digital assistant — Google Assistant on Android and Siri on iPhone.\n\nFor the most part, the touchpads are responsive. If I could add one thing to the earbuds, it would be volume controls. As it stands, the only way to control the volume is on your connected device.\nI should also mention my first review unit was a dud and had a defective right touchpad that wouldn't respond to a single-tap to play and pause music. Sony sent over a new replacement pair and they worked perfectly.\nThe touchpads also don't play nice with wet or sweaty fingers. During runs, I noticed the touchpad controls were hit or miss. When my fingers were dry, the controls worked, but if they were sweaty, not so much. \n\nDesign aside, the top complaint people have with AirPods is that they don't fit well. Maybe the stems stick out or the buds fall out all the time. (Consider trying these AirPods upgrades.) Everyone's ears are different so the fit naturally varies.\nCompared to AirPods, the WF-1000XM3's and their in-ear tips reach deeper into your ears for a snugger fit. Like the Beats Powerbeats Pro, Sony's earbuds have an angled acoustic housing that sits better in your ears' concha bowls.\nIn my tests, the WF-1000XM3's stayed put in my ears and didn't slip out during sweaty runs even though they're not water or sweat resistant.\n\nIncluded in the box are two types of ear tips: silicone and foam, each in three sizes. I found myself preferring the foam tips for their better fit and sound isolation.\nSuperior sound with noise cancelation\n\nAnyone who uses AirPods knows they sound OK — good, but not stellar by any means. True wireless earbuds with in-ear designs like the Powerbeats Pro are better at keeping outside noise from seeping in, but they still let in some ambient sound.\nThe WF-1000XM3's are in a whole other league. With built-in noise cancelation tech — a tap on the left earbud's touchpad turns it on — the earbuds instantly drown out almost all background noise so it's just you and your music.\nWith noise cancelation, I noticed songs sounded warmer, bass felt deeper, and highs were brighter. There's more clarity across all frequencies and I could hear the difference with and without it in noisy places like the streets and subway.\n\nNow, the noise cancelation isn't perfect. You can still hear some ambient noise, especially at volumes below 50 percent. But compared to AirPods or Galaxy Buds, where your music simply can't overpower outside sounds unless you crank the volume up really high, the WF-1000XM3's noise cancelation is as good as it gets on true wireless earbuds.\nIt's not, however, as good as what you get from over-ear headphones with built-in noise cancelation, such as Sony's own best-in-class WH-1000XM3 or Bose's QC 35 II's or new 700 cans. \nDespite the wireless earbuds using a newer version of Sony's noise-cancelation processor, the QN1e, Sony's over-ear noise-canceling headphones are better at blocking external noise because they use four microphones (versus two) to ingest more ambient sound and feed it through the chip to cancel it out.\nOver-ear noise-canceling headphones also have additional sound isolation from the foam-padded cups that cover your whole ear, whereas earbuds don't.\nTwo other big pluses for the WF-1000XM3: 1) There's an ambient sound mode, which is good for when you do want to hear what's happening around you, like when you're biking, and 2) There's a \"Quick Attention Mode\" that turns off noise cancelation when you cover the left earbud, which is useful for times when you don't want to take the buds off.\nLoads of battery life\n\nAfter comfort and sound quality, I was impressed with the WF-1000XM3's long-lasting battery life. It varies based on what sound mode you have them set to. \nWith noise cancelation turned on, the earbuds last up to 6 hours on a single charge. Turn noise cancelation off, though, and battery life shoots up to 8 hours of music playback.\nHere's how the WF-1000XM3's battery life compares to the best true wireless earbuds:\n\n  WF-1000XM3 (with noise cancelation): 6 hours\n  WF-1000XM3 (without noise cancelation): 8 hours\n  AirPods: 5 hours\n  Galaxy Buds: 6 hours\n  Powerbeats Pro: 9 hours\n\nThe large charging case also adds an impressive number of extra charges:\n\n  WF-1000XM3 (with noise cancelation): 18 hours (3 charges)\n  WF-1000XM3 (without noise cancelation): 24 hours (4 charges)\n  AirPods: 19 hours (3.8 charges)\n  Galaxy Buds: 7 hours (1.2 charge)\n  Powerbeats Pro: 15 hours (1.7 charge)\n\nCompared to my second-gen AirPods, which need to be popped back into their charging case by the middle of the day, the WF-1000XM3's often lasted entire 9-5 workdays (without noise cancelation) before needing a recharge.\nAs excellent as the battery life is, the charging case is my least favorite thing about the WF-1000XM3. It's huge — about twice the size of an AirPods case — and doesn't fit in my pockets without bulging out. \n\nThe case size isn't an issue if you stash it in a jacket pocket or purse, and you can make the argument that the Powerbeats Pro's massive clamshell case is even worse, but that doesn't change the fact Sony could have made the case smaller.\nI'm sympathetic to the fact that the larger case also means more stored charges, but I would much rather have a slightly smaller case with maybe one less charge so that it fits in my jeans.\nEverything AirPods aren't — in a good way\n\nSony may not be the consumer electronics king it was in the '90s, but one thing it still knows how to make are class-leading headphones.\nLike its WH-1000XM3 over-ear noise-cancelation headphones, the WF-1000XM3's exceeded my expectations. They fit really well, sound amazing thanks to noise cancelation, and last seemingly forever. What more could you want from true wireless earbuds? \nSure, the charging case is big, you can't pair the earbuds to multiple devices like you can with AirPods, and they cost $70 more. But if you want one of the best-sounding true wireless earbuds around, you'll have to gloss over these mostly minor drawbacks.\nWATCH: Sony’s WF-1000XM3 are AirPods with noise

as life's default setting.\nThis is the ambitious goal designer and creator Scott Urban set out to achieve with his newest line of \"privacy eyewear.\" Dubbed Phantom, the glasses seek to, at least in part, stem the tide of facial-recognition technology chipping away at our ability to exist in society without being tracked. \nIt's just an added bonus that they look good while doing it. \nThe Phantoms are the latest iteration in privacy wear from Urban, whose 2016 Reflectacles Ghost frames — currently sold out — reflect both visible light and infrared light as a way to partially blind traditional flash photography and IR security cameras. \nUnlike the Ghost model, the newer Phantoms (pictured above) reflect only IR light and also come with the option of IR-light blocking lenses. This means that your face won't be blurred out in photographs taken with a flash, or in standard security camera footage in a well-lit environment. But that doesn't mean the glasses aren't working.\n\"I’m just providing an opt-out because the system is not an opt-in.\" \nThe frames are specifically designed to defeat 3D dot matrix face-mapping systems, which is basically what makes Apple's Face ID work. They bounce infrared light back at its source, with the goal of preventing IR video cameras from getting a good image of your face — or potentially even registering your face as a face at all. \n\"The days of when privacy was equated to criminals is long gone,\" Urban explained over email. \"Now it’s all going to be about corporations/governments using your face to know everything about you and gather all of your data into a neat little profile. I and many others would simply prefer to not be on their system.\"\n\nUrban clearly understands that he's not alone is his concern regarding the creeping pervasiveness of facial-recognition tech. Just this past May, San Francisco voted to ban the local government's use of the technology in response to a demonstrated capacity for error and abuse. \nAs the ACLU put it in an open letter to Amazon's Jeff Bezos imploring the CEO to stop selling its product Rekognition to government agencies, facial-recognition technology promises to track people \"attending a protest, congregating outside a place of worship, or simply living their lives.\"\nThe Phantom frames are a small, but meaningful, way of individually pushing back against that unpleasant future. \n\"I’m just providing an opt-out because the system is not an opt-in,\" continued Urban, \"it’s everywhere and unregulated.\"\nThe Phantom\nTo the casual observer, Phantoms appear to be a standard pair of glasses. They can be fitted with tinted lenses as well as prescription lenses.\nThe new design and focus on infrared light is a reaction to, in Urban's mind, the changing surveillance landscape, especially as more and more mobile phones incorporate facial recognition. \n\nBut it's not just Apple's Face ID that relies on infrared light. Infrared security cameras are ubiquitous. You see them at bars, corner stores, restaurants, parking lots, and on street corners. They typically work by illuminating a dark location with IR LED lights — an effect invisible to the human eye — and then recording the resulting image with a special camera. \nThe Phantom frames are a response to these varying forms of surveillance.\n\"Infrared Radiation (IR) in the forms of 3D dot matrix mapping and laser scanning are the most accurate forms of facial recognition technology and they will soon become the most common,\" Urban writes on his Kickstarter page. \"Phantom [maintains] your privacy on these systems during both day and night. They also obscure your facial data on [more traditional] 2D IR surveillance cameras in low light environments and block IR eye-tracking.\"\nBlocking some forms of eye-tracking is an especially interesting bonus of the glasses, as that technology has been highlighted as particularly invasive by a diverse group ranging from Microsoft to the ACLU.\nAll of this, it should be noted, is going on behind the scenes as far as anyone looking at your shades can tell. By not reflecting visible light, the Phantoms are essentially indistinguishable from a standard pair of glasses to the naked eye. \nThis differs from the Ghost frames which, while stylish, are slightly conspicuous. The pattern and material used to reflect visible light might stand out as a bit of a fashion choice. It should be said, however, that over the several months I tried these glasses out in San Francisco, I didn't feel out of place. \n\nIt's worth noting that the Ghosts are cool. Reflecting visible light has the side effect of screwing with any unexpected flash photography and serves as a bonus safety feature. As an urban cyclist, having car headlights bounce off my face and back at drivers is a great way of reminding them I exist. \nThe Phantoms, on the other hand, are intentionally more subtle. Other than the fact that they are a little wider than traditional glasses frames for technical reasons, no casual observer will be the wiser that you're sporting anti-facial recognition gear. \n\"On traditional IR surveillance cameras, Phantom will illuminate around the eye space, denying algorithms the critical biometrics for a match,\" the product description reads. It adds that with 3D infrared mapping \"the reflected IR beams from Phantom will distort the facial data to maintain your privacy.\"\nYou can test the latter point out yourself (or, if you don't use Face ID, have a friend or coworker do it for you). Wearing the Phantom frames essentially breaks Apple's aforementioned facial-recognition tech, which relies on an \"infrared image of your face.\" \n\nThe Phantom frames also come with the optional IRlenses — lenses that prevent infrared-light cameras from seeing your eyes.  \nThe frames launched, as initially did the Reflectacles, in the form of a Kickstarter. Unveiled in June, the crowd-funding effort quickly surpassed its initial stated goal with a shipping date of April 20, 2020. Once the Kickstarter ends on July 24, customers will be able to pre-order the frames directly from the Reflectacles website for $142.  \nI was sent an early pair of the Phantoms in February, and have worn them to numerous locations around the city that have infrared security cameras. One such location allowed me to view the security footage of a friend wandering around a back stock room while wearing the Phantoms. The room was dark, and his face was slightly obscured on the security monitor. I could still tell it was my friend, but a computer program scanning the footage for a face match might not be so successful because, according to Urban, it may misinterpret the face as a light source. \nNotably, those of you envisioning some form of William Gibson's \"Ugly Shirt\" should slow your roll. Many security cameras these days record some combination of IR light and light on the visible spectrum, meaning the Phantoms don't exactly make you invisible. \nBut that's not really the point. Urban knows that his glasses are not a panacea. With the Ghost, he warns that the distance from the facial-recognition device in question will alter the frames' performance, and that \"more complex cameras with large exposure sensors or off-axis lighting will not have the same effect.\" For their part, the Phantoms are a specific response to a specific surveillance concern — so don't count on them to facilitate your next bank robbery.\nStill, with privacy threatening to become a relic of a forgotten time, those concerned about its impending death have to start pushing back somewhere. Why not here?\n\nUrban emphasized over email that he sees privacy as a universal value that — just like his customer base — transcends the partisan divide. And, importantly, his frames have an impact that's larger than the immediate and personal one. \n\"People who are not hip to privacy may be quick to dismiss a privacy advocate as paranoid, but when they talk [and] have a face-to-face conversation with somebody about privacy and see they are not 'crazy,' it has a direct impact that just can’t be done within an article,\" he wrote.\nIn the end, Phantom frames should be one of many tools in your privacy toolbox. Making privacy the default setting offline as well as on will take time and effort — but you might as well look cool while doing the work.  "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1012365%252F49a97a03-368f-409f-a879-61b9b242bdea.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=V1e3PrUDWoxoEd2FspK7i4IRzQk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=t7swaB7eF1ELmu0pDnlg4F0FImA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F356x205.png?signature=xHPRCq01inmTPsZlRp-ueqnUNWE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F712x410.png?signature=IVmoCkOt8yoPWVxS-yhQTWoDUrA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F280x157.png?signature=PEN62MJtGrPllVLYjTvGM2L1hKY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F560x314.png?signature=Er6_Z68bO7Uu8L4Xa5eeRyeO7Mk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Fight facial-recognition technology with Phantom glasses","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F356x205.png?signature=xHPRCq01inmTPsZlRp-ueqnUNWE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F280x157.png?signature=PEN62MJtGrPllVLYjTvGM2L1hKY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F99107%252Fd0f23611-91b4-4a72-900c-9db6d3f9ccfe.png%252F356x205.png?signature=xHPRCq01inmTPsZlRp-ueqnUNWE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Fight facial-recognition technology with Phantom glasses","choice":true,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"productreview":[{"id":1012473,"data-id":1012473,"data-template":"default","data-product-url":"null","data-product-price":"null","data-product-name":"undefined","data-product-good":"null","data-product-bad":"null","data-product-blurb":"undefined","data-product-score":"undefined","data-product-coolness":"undefined","data-product-curve":"undefined","data-product-performance":"undefined","data-product-value":"undefined","data-product-score-title":"undefined","data-product-coolness-title":"undefined","data-product-curve-title":"undefined","data-product-performance-title":"undefined","data-product-bang-for-the-buck-title":"undefined","class":"content-productreview"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The specialty glasses are designed to thwart various forms of facial-recognition tech.

All of these are valid reasons to not get AirPods!\nIf you're nodding your head in agreement, I highly recommend the Powerbeats Pro. They've got the same Apple H1 chip technology that gives the AirPods 2 its convenient pairing with Apple devices (iOS and Mac), hands-free Siri voice controls, and long-lasting battery life, but have none of the aforementioned AirPods downsides. \nThe only things that might turn you off are the charging case and price. Compared to AirPods' tiny dental floss-sized charging case, the one for Powerbeats Pro is huge; you won't be fitting it in any skinny jeans. And at $249.95, the Powerbeats command a hefty premium over $159 AirPods.\nFinally cable-free\n\nAt first blush, the Powerbeats Pro look little more than a cable-free version of Beats' popular Powerbeats 3 wireless earbuds.\nBut Beats went beyond simply cutting the cord connecting the two earbuds. The Apple-owned company actually redesigned the sporty wireless earbuds from the ground up for improved comfort and sound quality.\nCompared to Powerbeats 3, the Powerbeats Pro are 23 percent smaller and 17 percent lighter. I've always found the Powerbeats 3 a little on the bulky side so it's nice that the Powerbeats Pro are more compact. Beats also changed the acoustic housing so it's angled and fits better in ears.\n\nAll of these improvements make the Powerbeats Pro more comfortable to wear for hours. But more importantly, they make the earbuds comfier when you're using them while working out or running. \nIt felt great not having a cable flapping around the back of my neck while running with the Powerbeats Pro. I also appreciated the in-ear design that sits deeper in your ears and helps keep them in place. I've never had a problem with AirPods falling out of my ears except in one place: on planes. Every time I nod off on a flight, one of my AirPods always gets knocked outta my ear. With Powerbeats Pro, I knew they would stay securely in place and not slip out thanks to the ear hooks.\nI get that the ear hooks design might not be for everyone, but they feel better than they look. The ear hooks can also be tricky to wrap around your ears at first, but with a little practice, putting them on becomes easier.\nThe wireless earbuds are sorta smart, too, thanks to Apple's H1 chip. As with AirPods, connecting the Powerbeats Pro to an iOS device is as simple as opening the case (Android users will need to go into the Bluetooth settings and manually connect). \n\nSimilarly, you can easily switch between iOS and Mac if you're logged into your iCloud account on the latter. Furthermore, taking one earbud out of your ear automatically pauses the music and putting it back in resumes playback.\n\nOn AirPods, the only way to control the volume is to do so on the device it's connected to or use Siri (who does this?). However, on Powerbeats Pro, there are physical volume buttons on both earbuds and the Beats logo also doubles as a play/pause and Siri activation button (long press). \nOverall, I have no complaints about the Powerbeats Pro earbuds design and features. The have everything that makes AirPods feel \"magical\" and then some.\nBangin' sound quality\nAs much as I love my AirPods, I admit they could sound better. The audio quality is fine — as good as wired EarPods — but they won't knock your socks off if you want high-fidelity audio quality. Their tiny size doesn't leave a whole lot of room for quality drivers that can push out better sound.\nWhile Powerbeats Pro aren't audiophile-grade wireless earbuds by any means, they sound noticeably better than AirPods in my opinion, and not just for bass-heavy music.\nListening to a variety variety of music genres — everything from EDM to classical to hip-hop — I found the Powerbeats Pro produced a wider audio range. Music sounds warmer with more distinguishable mids and highs and the low-end no longer drowns out everything. This improved sound is especially noticeable in a song like Childish Gambino's \"Summertime Magic,\" where the bass doesn't overpower the vocals as much as through AirPods.\n\nBack in the day, Beats headphones were notorious for prioritizing bass over all other frequencies. Those days are over. Beats president Luke Wood told me during a press preview that they now tune their headphones, including the Powerbeats Pro, to sound more like what it does in the recording studio.\nUsing new linear piston drivers, the Powerbeats Pro, produce cleaner sound with less distortion when the volume is cranked up. \nCombined with the tighter sealing from the in-ear tips, the Powerbeats Pro really sound fantastic. The sound quality's also not compromised during workouts or runs.\nBeats has come a really long way from its bass-y days and it's time consumers realize this.\nAll-day battery life\n\nBattery life is another way the Powerbeats Pro are better than AirPods. While I think most people agree AirPods get a respectable five hours of listening time on a single charge, Powerbeats last even longer with up to nine hours of listening from one charge.\nOn several days, I was able to leave them on during entire work days from around 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. before having to pop them back into the charging case. The charging case adds another 15 hours of listening time for a total of 24 hours. \nLike AirPods, the Powerbeats Pro can be quick charged. Beats says this \"Fast Fuel\" charging with a five-minute charge giving you 1.5 hours of music playback and 15 minutes giving you 4.5 hours. In comparison, AirPods get up to three hours with a 15-minute quick charge. It's definitely handy in a pinch!\nNow, about the charging case: It's big. The clam-shaped case is nearly four times larger than the AirPods charging case, which to be fair, is one of the smallest there is for true wireless earbuds.\n\nThe case isn't a problem if you've got a backpack, purse, or jacket pockets to stash it in. But if you like going out with as little as possible in your pockets, you're gonna hate that the case is large. \nAre you supposed to just put the earbuds in your pocket when you wanna take them off? And pray they don't get lost? As somebody who's lost wireless earbuds because I put them in my pockets instead of back into their case, I can say this is not something you wanna do. \n\nLeaving the charging case isn't as big of a deal if you're taking the Powerbeats Pro out for a quick run or workout because the battery lasts pretty long (you're not working out or running for nine straight hours are you?), but if you wanna take them off afterwards, you've got no choice but to hold them in your hands or put them in your pockets. At least with AirPods, the case is small enough to fit in your pocket. \nAirPods or Powerbeats Pro?\n\nSo AirPods or Powerbeats Pro? Personally, I still prefer AirPods because I can't stand the size of the Powerbeats Pro's charging case, but that's just me.\nBut if you can overlook the case because maybe you want better sound quality, a snugger fit, longer battery life, and physical controls, Powerbeats Pro are hard to beat and superior to AirPods. That said, at $250, there are also many wireless earbuds that offer arguably better sound and comparable comfort at similar pricing such as the $300 Master & Dynamic's MW07 or $300 Sennheiser Momentum.\nIf you're a runner or workout a lot, though, the Powerbeats Pro are a no-brainer in my opinion. For sports, Beats' Powerbeats are considered the gold standard, mainly because of battery life and the Powerbeats Pro are no different.\nTruthfully, you can't go wrong with either. Pick the one that works best for you. As with headphones, there's no one-size-fits-all for true wireless earbuds. What works for me might not for you since ears come in different shapes and sizes.\nWATCH: Apple's second-gen AirPods are
