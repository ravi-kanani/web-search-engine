To help you tell stories that cut through the noise, we’ve rounded up the Review’s six best tactics on storytelling. From founders to engineering leaders, marketing experts to design directors, our experts each approached the notion of “storytelling” from a slightly different angle. But taken together, they highlighted a key common thread: <strong class="Annotation -strong">Good storytelling isn’t about fanciful language. It’s about conveying a message clearly and simply. It’s about connecting with your audience not as customers, executives or investors,&nbsp;but as humans.</strong></p>
    <p id="text_8c4363e9bf2b4961ad3efaf9d51f4f52" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">After all, what’s company-building but a series of stories?

    <p id="text_316bc7740272438daa4c7778c51cd2a7" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Perhaps the most obvious storytelling opportunity at companies comes in the form of presentations. Whether you’re sharing a status update at a meeting or giving a talk for an audience of thousands, you want to make sure that you refine your delivery so that your story lands.</p>
    <p id="text_c03b60a99ffe4447b2643d0fbd62398e" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Take the example of a design agency presenting their work. “We know that our designs don’t live on with our clients without a good story attached to them,” says <strong class="Annotation -strong"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-kahn-a497a11/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">Nicole Kahn</a></strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-kahn-a497a11/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link"></a>, the former Senior Director of <strong class="Annotation -strong"><a href="https://www.ideo.com/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">IDEO</a></strong><a href="https://www.ideo.com/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link"></a>’s Design for Change Studio. “<strong class="Annotation -strong">Stories are the way our teams get excited, aligned, and rallied around the same goal</strong>.”</p>
    <p id="text_9985b1445ec64cf2bfce06bce405a652" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Hoping to ensure that all of their designers would also see themselves as storytellers, Kahn and her team held a series of events at IDEO offices across the country, sharing their set of best practices for giving high-impact presentations. The goal: to provide a model for what good presentations look like, while also giving designers a chance to talk about what inspires their creativity, and get solid feedback from an audience of their peers.</p>
    <p id="text_ca5ddd823604438989a049e4baa02534" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Here are two of those tested tactics:</p>
    <p id="text_b23556b887d34c43a3ad9934ea6938e8" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong">Find your story at the bar</strong></p>
    <p id="text_3b47f744fc1f40598ccb4c469a74e611" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“Bars are friendly, social places, sure, but something really important happens when you’re at a bar,” says Kahn. “You use really direct language. You make sure that what you’re saying is entertaining and engaging. You don’t quote tons of data. You don’t use overly corporate language — except maybe in air quotes.”</p>
    <p id="text_2db2825d903f4a3cb820f35c5208aa19" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">These experiences show that we all have an innate sense of what makes a good story, but we tend to forget it at work. So, how would you give your presentation at a bar? What if you only had the backs of napkins for graphics? How would that change the way you related information?</p>
    <p id="text_7d628abdc6d64e56b01cb5fa4025a39d" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">When we tell stories to our friends, we prove we're all natural born storytellers.</p>
    <p id="text_e0e43c3e6d144891a2699ed182cf824a" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“<strong class="Annotation -strong">By bringing the Bar Test into the work environment, we’re more able to answer this question: What’s the point</strong>?” Kahn says. “When we’re in the middle of a project, the sheer number of stories we could tell about it are as numerous as stars in the sky, and we get really excited to share them all to show what we’ve done, but we can’t do that.”</p>
    <p id="text_19e9c73996234df8937faaad259df539" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">To run the Bar Test, IDEO designers talk to other people — often strangers — before they start putting presentations together. “We tell them our story. We verbalize it. We grab a colleague who’s completely unfamiliar with what we’re doing and buy them a beer or a coffee and spend 15 minutes to see if they understand the point of the presentation.”</p>
    <p id="text_f4c9c7404cb44453842899af9163cb2c" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">When you do this with your colleagues or friends and family, pay attention to the little things, Kahn says. “We look for when they lean in, or when they look away or reach for their phone. We look for nods and ‘uh huhs’ — we look for what surprises and delights. That’s how we figure out what’s sticky and resonating.”</p>
    <p id="text_c18bb2e5416c4f799774522c0eed02ed" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">It doesn’t have to take much time at all — just the 15 minutes it takes to drink a coffee and get one or two pieces of feedback. “Force it to be succinct. That’s the magic of verbalizing your story. You’ve invested nothing and there’s no reason to get stuck. You can redo it again and again.”</p>
    <p id="text_8ada209164e7419c9e391cbb513980f3" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong">Build your skeleton</strong></p>
    <p id="text_88a80848acad466db50e284f2b3d92d8" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“After a good Bar Test, the skeleton of your story should emerge: the main points you know you have to hit to make it memorable," Kahn says.</p>
    <p id="text_847541ca46d44be0a4d8679e4fde570d" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong">It only takes three essential elements to make a great story:</strong></p>

    <p id="text_f32bd3b3e02f4dc7ad8e4b8972d52921" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Similarly, moments of reflection should be scattered throughout your talk to grab attention, create intimacy with your audience, and give them a window into your process. “I might say something like, ‘<strong class="Annotation -strong">I knew we were onto something the moment I met Sandy and she said this one thing.’ This cues the client to pay attention</strong>.”</p>

    <p id="text_4ce33a643fc843aaaffff631a962c055" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">In other words, leadership is less about having a perfectly-engineered vision, and more about telling a compelling story that convinces others to join you. “The reality is that visionaries like Steve Jobs weren’t successful because they thought of something amazing and original out of thin air,” he says. “Rather, they were gifted at constantly persuading many people to follow them on their journey to something amazing and original.”</p>

They communicate clearly without giving us all the answers. What most people think of as vision is actually persuasion.”</p>
    <p id="text_ae7b8a1adec542ba871cc9fc4c396fd3" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Trouble is, most tech operators express themselves with complexity, nuance, facts and figures. That’s their default, and it doesn’t appeal to people's unconscious processors. To help folks tell stories that resonate, Odean shares his top tips for smart, simple storytelling:</p>
    <p id="text_fb9b1ccfb5c84f12854e5c31d40851d8" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong">Distill your story into a highlight reel</strong></p>
    <p id="text_253012fc748f4c4ebb6d35008c2fce86" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">After any experience, humans create a representative image or memory of what happened — and they reason off that image. For instance, if they have an argument with someone, they’ll take away one or a handful of representative images of how that went down. No one gets to choose what sticks, it just happens.</p>
    <p id="text_dc67ec4be7f748be90ef976de6def4e4" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">For founders and marketers, this hits on one important point: “<strong class="Annotation -strong">People will remember a totally random sample of the information you give them about what you do</strong>.” It won’t be the best sample. It won’t be the summary you wish you could hand them. It’s a random set of data.</p>

But they don’t evaluate losses and gains relative to what they have — they evaluate them relative to what they feel like they have. “If you’re totally convinced you’re going to get a promotion, and then it falls through, you might experience that as a loss, even though — technically speaking — you didn’t lose anything. You just didn’t gain anything.”</p>

They therefore have the opportunity to buy in hand, but are about to lose it if they don’t act. This is why brands always incentivize you to try on clothes or test drive a car. <strong class="Annotation -strong">Once people start contemplating their ownership and see it in action, that’s their mental reference point.</strong> They’ll have to suffer a loss if they decide not to buy.”</p>

The CEO of <strong class="Annotation -strong"><a href="https://www.liveathos.com/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">Athos</a></strong><a href="https://www.liveathos.com/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link"></a> and former Head of Operations at <a href="https://pinterest.com" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">Pinterest</a> got his start at the U.S. Naval Academy. Throughout his impressive journey from the Marine Corps to Silicon Valley, he’s noticed one skill that made leaders stand out: being able to tell good, personal stories. In particular, good leaders need to be able to tell what Faul calls the “failure story.”</p>
    <p id="text_7a1d260fe24b47b5bcb9e7b0ae2db947" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“<strong class="Annotation -strong">Being vulnerable is one of the most powerful things you can do as a leader because it shows you’re genuine.</strong> Being genuine builds trust. Trust is the key to getting anything done,” says Faul. “If you’re willing to tell everyone on your team about your mistakes, your shortcomings, what you’re currently working on to get better, you seem more human<strong class="Annotation -strong">.</strong> It’s easier for people to connect with you. They have an easier time believing what you say, and that you’re taking their wellbeing into account.”</p>
    <p id="text_3ce4cdc894b84a1ba190ac3c0d43746b" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">It also gives people permission to take bigger risks in their own work. If your team knows about times you tried to do something and failed, they will also see that you recovered and went on to succeed. They won’t feel hard-pressed to be perfect or place small bets so they always win. When you’re at a startup, you can’t afford to play it safe.</p>
    <p id="text_81eca3380be64913a6f69cf0b5e33df0" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Faul remembers when he first started leading people in the Marines, being vulnerable was very difficult for him in the same way it’s hard for many new tech managers. “You don’t want to show any sign of weakness because you want to convince everyone — maybe mostly yourself — that you’re there for a reason, you’re not a fraud, you don’t have any doubts,” he says.</p>
    <p id="text_59b10903795e4193ac3a7635e13efcd8" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">His attitude toward vulnerability and sharing failure didn’t start changing until he arrived in Silicon Valley and saw examples set from leaders he’s worked with. Now he feels responsible for modeling this approach to the managers on his own team. It’s one of the most powerful ways to pass these skills along to more people and strengthen your entire organization.</p>

    <p id="text_0343b544f9f244a3a0d16111569c12e1" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">One of the key failure stories Faul shares draws from his time at Pinterest. Early on, he worked on major projects related to the company’s culture. “I know there were many pieces of this I approached the wrong way. I made some bad decisions, including one that didn’t get the response we wanted at all inside the company — it just didn’t land,” he says. “It was my first big, visible failure as an executive, and I knew it reflected poorly on me. I had to work through that, acknowledge the failure, apologize for it, discuss it over and over again. It was incredibly hard for me to do.”</p>
    <p id="text_fa247ecffb914636923c783f0de64bb0" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Instead of sweeping the episode under the rug, he now tells this story again and again. Whenever his team confronts a similar situation or makes a mistake, he recalls it. Because the truth is, he did get through it. His team at Pinterest not only survived but went on to other successes. Knowing that recovery is possible on this level generates productive psychological safety for everyone involved.</p>
    <p id="text_03decc600706445e9cdfa6dc8666f725" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“I can tell people, ‘I’ve been through this and I legitimately know that you’re going to make it through this and be fine, be better, do more,’” he says. “Now I have three or four stories over the course of my career like this that I tell to soften these hard moments for the people I work with and give them the confidence to endure and stay excited.”</p>

I’ll even practice with my wife. I don’t think people should expect to be good at this spontaneously. And it’s so important to get right.”</p></li>

She’s spied another pitfall that startups all too often stumble into: failing to construct the company’s culture and distinct story. “When you’re small, the focus is always on <em class="Annotation -emphasis">product product produc</em>t, but building a strong team and a strong culture is a hugely important part of building a great product long term,” says Graham.</p>
    <p id="text_441a6316c0904382a56c5dd384830e85" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Take Amazon's well-known practice of writing press releases for products, before they even build a prototype or write a spec. “They take the time to first think through what they want to say to the world when they launch the product.

But it needs to make it clear what you are and what you aren’t as a company,” she says. It also needs to give you language that you can re-use again and again in the press, in hiring, in product announcements, and at all-hands meetings to reinforce what your company is about, who you want to attract, and why you’re doing what you do.</p>

I am definitely qualified to do that. I want that job!’” This happens because job descriptions are written like pitches, practically selling the idea of the job to prospective candidates. “I once got some amazing advice to write your job description for the one person that should absolutely 100% be in that role,” she says. “You want everyone who isn’t right for the job to think, ‘Oh my god, I definitely don’t want that job.’ The same is true of your company's culture narrative: <strong class="Annotation -strong">When you have a well-crafted, specific, controversial company story, it can guide everything from who you shouldn’t hire to how you settle arguments</strong>.”</p></li>

The product expert still had focus groups asking him, “Wait, I don’t get it. Do you mean <em class="Annotation -emphasis">streamlining</em>?” No, <em class="Annotation -emphasis">streaming</em>, he would say. No one knew what that meant.

    <p id="text_7fcd545d80c14753af6ee07b81d59a16" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Biddle works with startups in ways that leverage many minds at once. For example, during a workshop with employees at Naturebox, he divided the group into teams of six to apply his positioning model to the business. All participants reconvened to share their thoughts at the end of the hour. The objective of this exercise is to capture and articulate what others value about a company, so it’s critical to get many perspectives. It’s also helpful to track shared language across teams. Here are the initial answers from three of the groups at Naturebox:</p>

Your customers are busy so they don’t have time to parse fuzzy concepts. Your goal is not to dumb it down, but to tighten it up. ” Biddle challenged Group A to unpack “custom subscription snackbox.” One person offered: “Snackbox Delivered to Your Door.” That was too “salesy” for Biddle. “Snackbox Subscription Service.” That works. What would someone with zero context and limited knowledge of your business understand right away? Go with that.</p>

    <p id="text_b1baa2cc1db54cf696e6a53e6575e766" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">The best meetings are the ones where the VCs in the room want to take this journey with you — and to ensure this, you have to hit all the stops they’re anticipating. “Lay out the map for them at the beginning: ‘I am going to talk about engagement; I am going to talk about monetization; I am going to talk about our team and features and potential competitors,’” Jacob says.</p>
    <p id="text_349091da3fe3424abd66535e98c9b398" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">You may walk into a meeting with 12 slides — he recommends 12 — with the plan to touch on each of them sequentially. But more often than not, an investor will ask to skip slide two or jump ahead to slide eight.</p>
    <p id="text_1486a4c75f9042a79b9ba3b81407b2af" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“You might be in control of how to tell your story, but you also need to read the room. If they are trying to pull you toward one topic, listen to them and adjust accordingly but keep the story’s structure intact. You have designed the story to build toward the conclusion that they have to invest in you. You have to build that case no matter what.”</p>
    <p id="text_425dc64fe9e64a54a322f29ca9c62777" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">When you design your presentation, you want to make sure to emphasize the points that will drive people to the conviction that they should back your idea. If you believe the market opportunity is the most compelling thing you have to share, spend more time on it. If you believe the strength of your team is unmatched, take the time to dive into their bios and experience. You want to build your presentation and slides so that your argument only gets stronger and gains momentum as you go along.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p id="text_f32cc5147f4746caa68cde5a4ceedde0" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Tactically, Jacob says it’s also critical to not plan a full hour of material. <strong class="Annotation -strong">You should be able to tell your whole story, in a compelling and detailed fashion, in just 20 minutes.</strong> “This will almost always expand to fill the hour. You’ll be interrupted. You’ll answer questions. You’ll decide in that moment to flesh something out a bit more or add more detail to something. You’ll get the sense that someone in the room wants to dwell more on product construction or this stat or that stat. You don’t want to end up running out of time</p>
    <p id="text_3e93d44142e746d7a97cbe89e1049ac7" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">At the same time, you want to have hours and hours of nerdy details squirreled away in your head, Jacob says. “Through practicing you can feel better and better about leaving those details out, but should the conversation go that way, you can bring them to the forefront if necessary. Have some well-known short stories as examples — a user who loves what you’re doing, for example. Those can be useful answers to general questions. When you tell stories like that you can find ways to move the conversation to other points you want to hit.”</p>
    <p id="text_97b673ad6f724badb89471182c33e60c" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">The important thing is to make the words your own. “<strong class="Annotation -strong">You should be able to give your pitch with no slides. Cold,</strong>” says Jacob. “Hit every key point you want, unrushed in 20 minutes. Practice as if the projector bulb blew out several times and make sure you can still do it then — and don’t wait until the night before. Be able to recreate any idea you have on a white board in less than one minute. Label the axes and call out the three to four critical points on the graph that characterize the point you are trying to make.”</p>
    <p id="text_dd2cb7ec1b7a49ab821bed414bfcc34d" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong">Finally, remember that great stories are unexpected.</strong></p>
    <p id="text_2959f82e8f6b4ba58132cf28871ce9ba" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“You have to make investors believe how much you believe in it, and how much you want to go on that journey with them — even if neither of you knows how big it can get," Jacob says. "When you’re in pitches, you should make your case not to raise money, but because you’re so excited about what you could possibly accomplish.”</p>
