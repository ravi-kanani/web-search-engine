          <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">Week one at Udemy, I was encouraged to set up one-on-one “coffee chats” with the immediate five stakeholders on my team. I felt anxious asking these busy individuals for time on their calendars. Soon, I learned that people here are incredibly warm, supportive and helpful (no one turned me down)! In the next few weeks, I met with over thirty Udemites across different teams, and each conversation helped me learn more holistically about Udemy as a company. I am grateful to Product, Design, Engineering and Udemy as a whole for the investment in me and am humbled to know that my research and design work will live beyond my internship.</span></p>

       <p style="text-align: center"><b>Arthur Hwang – Corporate Finance Intern</b></p> 
       <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a Bay Area native who’s excited about technology that makes the world better, I was thrilled to join Udemy this summer as a financial analyst intern. I’ve had an incredible learning experience, growing my finance skills, understanding the tech business landscape a bit more every day, and even attending a hip hop dancing class taught by my boss during Udemy’s Global Learning Fair! While I’m headed to sing and travel the world with the Yale Whiffenpoofs next year, I will always miss my awesome team and intern friends!</span></p>

       <p style="text-align: center"><b>Irene Suarez – Social Media Intern</b></p> 
       <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">Having finished my second year at California State University-Fullerton, I wanted to experience what it’s like to work at a tech company in San Francisco. The large responsibility of contributing to Udemy’s social media platforms by creating content, developing campaign analyses, and executing my own campaign allowed me to learn so much about who our followers are and how to develop effective strategies on social media. During my time here, I’ve made new friends and drank all the coffee the city can offer me. With one more year left in college, I plan to make the best of my education and continue to explore opportunities I find along the way.</span></p>
