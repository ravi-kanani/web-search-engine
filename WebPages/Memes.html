  <meta content="Memes are ideas, behaviors, actions, attitudes, or mannerism that are passed from one person to another in the hopes of spreading a specific or recurring idea, subject, or moment. The word meme was originally designated by Richard Dawkins in the 1976 book The Selfish Gene. In the book, Dawkins used the word meme in an attempt at describing how cultural information spreads. Because you're reading this online, let's talk about the best memes of all: internet memes, a.k.a. memes. Thanks to the instant and widespread communication abilities of the modern internet, internet culture has embraced memes which can range from anything such as a simple catchphrase to a GIF, reaction, video, or photo. Recent popular memes include Blinking White Guy, Harlem Shake, Roll Safe, Distracted Boyfriend, Delete Your Account, Milkshake Duck, Emoji Sheriff, Harambe, Babadook, and Spongebob. Internet memes were first coined by Mike Goodwin in the June 1993 article issue of Wired." data-page-subject="true" property="og:description">

             <p>Memes are ideas, behaviors, actions, attitudes, or mannerism that are passed from one person to another in the hopes of spreading a specific or recurring idea, subject, or moment. The word meme was originally designated by Richard Dawkins in the 1976 book The Selfish Gene. In the book, Dawkins used the word meme in an attempt at describing how cultural information spreads. Because you're reading this online, let's talk about the best memes of all: internet memes, a.k.a. memes. Thanks to the instant and widespread communication abilities of the modern internet, internet culture has embraced memes which can range from anything such as a simple catchphrase to a GIF, reaction, video, or photo. Recent popular memes include Blinking White Guy, Harlem Shake, Roll Safe, Distracted Boyfriend, Delete Your Account, Milkshake Duck, Emoji Sheriff, Harambe, Babadook, and Spongebob. Internet memes were first coined by Mike Goodwin in the June 1993 article issue of Wired.</p>

You happen to be standing next to a lever that would divert the trolley onto another path, where a single person is standing. You can't save both, so you have to decide between letting the trolley take its course and kill multiple people, or be responsible for killing one person to save the others. \nThe United States is facing a parallel, but much less morally conflicting issue. The disease COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus continues to spread, despite multiple states mandating \"shelter in place\" and \"safer at home\" policies. Closing non-essential businesses is more effective for social distancing and flattening the curve, but millions are out of jobs and unable to pay their bills. \nThe stock market plummeted last week, and as Americans call on the federal government to pass relief packages for individuals in need, the Trump administration want to bail out the cruse and airline industry. Congress, meanwhile, is working on a $2 trillion stimulus package to float the country through the economic fallout. \nSEE ALSO: Coronavirus has somehow given us Shakespeare plague memes\nTrump, meanwhile, is pushing businesses to reopen. During a town hall on Tuesday, he said he wants \"packed churches\" on Easter Sunday in less than three weeks, effectively undoing nationwide social distancing efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. \n“I would love to have that. It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’d love to make it an important day for this,\" Trump said. \"I would love to have the country opened up, and rarin’ to go by Easter.”\nTwitter users are pointing out just how ridiculous the capitalist dilemma is right now — it's barely a trolley problem at all. Why put so much weight on economic development when there are literal human lives at risk?\nThis one's a real head-scratcher. pic.twitter.com/f0mUAvCk1K— Juhana Leinonen (@JuhanaIF) March 24, 2020\n\npic.twitter.com/yZgiF7hnec— Janus Rose, Post-Apocalyptic Delivery Dyke (@zenalbatross) March 24, 2020\n\nIn our version of the Trolley Problem, we'd get what Michael the Demon from \"The Good Place\" suggested would be the optimal way to handle the Trolley Problem: dangle a long sharp pole out the window to pick off the [economy] while smooshing the five original guys. 6/ pic.twitter.com/LBkprfCpdf— Ken Tremendous (@KenTremendous) March 24, 2020\n\nthis is our present reality, now pic.twitter.com/9O0yc2EoP6— Kelsey D.

Hit Snooze is Mashable's deep dive into how we cope with our collective insomnia and the many ways we can achieve a more peaceful slumber.\n\nJoking about your sleep paralysis demon just hits different right now. \nMany Americans are about a week and a half into their social distancing, which means they're about a week and a half into only seeing the people they live with, if they live with anyone at all. In an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, 17 states have enacted \"stay at home\" policies as of Wednesday. By shuttering all non-essential businesses, banning large gatherings, and mandating that residents stay inside except for daily exercise and to get supplies, we're flattening the curve and limiting the strain on our already overwhelmed healthcare system. Nearly 100 million Americans reside in states where they're urged to avoid interacting with anyone outside of their households. \nIt's a lonely time. \nAs the COVID-19 pandemic stretches on, Twitter users are bringing back the sleep paralysis demon meme, joking that they're lonely enough to consider seeking solace in their night terrors. \nquarantine day 7: hoping my sleep paralysis demon dresses slutty tonight— halil (@astateofhalil) March 23, 2020\n\nSleep paralysis occurs during between wakefulness and sleep; those who experience it feel like they're awake, but can't move. The 8 percent of the population who have sleep paralysis report sensations like being unable to breathe, feeling a pressure on their chest, and visual and auditory hallucinations. It can be a terrifying experience, especially if you're in the limbo between consciousness and slumber. Some report a ghostly or otherworldly presence, which is their brain rationalizing the mismatch in dream cycles. \nThe sensation became a meme in early 2019, according to Know Your Meme. When a Twitter thread encouraging artists to draw their sleep paralysis demons went viral, the phrase \"sleep paralysis demon\" became a catch-all for unfortunate and cursed beings that visit in the night. \nSay hello to my personal sleep paralysis demon, @VioletChachki pic.twitter.com/7AOGVpYIeJ— Aquaria (@aquariaofficial) June 8, 2019\n\nmy sleep paralysis demon at 3am waiting for me to stop listening to sad playlists and go the sleep already so it can do its job https://t.co/xkgwu1hC1e— indie (@INDIEWASHERE) November 12, 2019\n\n\"[This] humor has been charged with making light of it by joking about spooky things,\" Know Your Meme editor Adam Downer told Mashable in a phone call. \nApproaching a year since it was born, the sleep paralysis meme has had an unusually long lifespan for anything online. But it has three key ingredients that's made it endure so long: it's easy to replicate, it's easy to personalize, and it hasn't quite blown up to the point where people are tired of it. \nThe meme might have fizzled out, if not for social distancing giving it a second wind. \nSocial distancing can save hundreds of thousands of lives, if done correctly. An early model from the New York Times estimated that with testing and effective social distancing, we could limit the number of COVID-19 cases from 9 million to 513,000. The number of coronavirus deaths would decrease from an estimated 982,000 to 51,000. Social distancing, at this point, is a necessity. \nBut it's also incredibly lonely, and estimates that this could be our reality for months make it even more daunting. \nAnd when you start feeling starved for physical affection during quarantine, cuddling up to your sleep paralysis demon starts sounding more appealing. \ntrying to give myself sleep paralysis so i can feel someone else’s touch— jebby (@lidglue) March 23, 2020\n\nso lonely in quarantine i just summoned my sleep paralysis demon for a goodnight kiss on the forehead— jen merritt!!!

You can host parties over Zoom. You can keep dating through FaceTime. You can pick up new hobbies and practice them while calling friends.

What to do with all that time inside? \nInspired by Shakespeare's legendary quarantine output, folks on the internet have done what folks on the internet do — make memes. The general consensus?

Scratch that: None of us can be Shakespeare. That jabroni did not have Netflix. \nStill, while you're stuck at home, take time for yourself and try to actively quell any anxieties that come up. If you get bored, here are some movies you can watch to kill the time. If possible, try to limit your time surfing all the bad news online. Wash your hands. And outside of the actual work you do from home, if you find some time to be productive, that's awesome! Just don't compare yourself to Shakespeare.\nAnd again, try to stay away from people. Please.

Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign, hoping to save face. It won’t work!\"\nThe former NYC mayor then responded with a clip directly from Star Wars, where Darth Vader strikes down Obi-Wan Kenobi in a duel.

Per hour! When you realize you've been doing that for a lifetime, it can be pretty jarring, especially if you know it's best to break the habit.

There are a number of easy, free precautions you can take to protect yourself, like washing your hands frequently and keeping your devices and work surfaces clean. \nThere's still a lot of coronavirus misinformation out there, though. Take a look at the World Health Organization's myth busting page if you're unsure whether you've received good information.\nAnd if you're in the United States, there's no need to panic. Dr. Purvi Parikh, a clinical assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Health, told Mashable's Natasha Piñon on Thursday that while \"it's good to take precautions,\" US residents shouldn't freak out just yet. \nThat doesn't mean you can touch your face, though.

You happen to be standing next to a lever that would divert the trolley onto another path, where a single person is standing. You can't save both, so you have to decide between letting the trolley take its course and kill multiple people, or be responsible for killing one person to save the others. \nThe United States is facing a parallel, but much less morally conflicting issue. The disease COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus continues to spread, despite multiple states mandating \"shelter in place\" and \"safer at home\" policies. Closing non-essential businesses is more effective for social distancing and flattening the curve, but millions are out of jobs and unable to pay their bills. \nThe stock market plummeted last week, and as Americans call on the federal government to pass relief packages for individuals in need, the Trump administration want to bail out the cruse and airline industry. Congress, meanwhile, is working on a $2 trillion stimulus package to float the country through the economic fallout. \nSEE ALSO: Coronavirus has somehow given us Shakespeare plague memes\nTrump, meanwhile, is pushing businesses to reopen. During a town hall on Tuesday, he said he wants \"packed churches\" on Easter Sunday in less than three weeks, effectively undoing nationwide social distancing efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. \n“I would love to have that. It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’d love to make it an important day for this,\" Trump said. \"I would love to have the country opened up, and rarin’ to go by Easter.”\nTwitter users are pointing out just how ridiculous the capitalist dilemma is right now — it's barely a trolley problem at all.

Hit Snooze is Mashable's deep dive into how we cope with our collective insomnia and the many ways we can achieve a more peaceful slumber.\n\nJoking about your sleep paralysis demon just hits different right now. \nMany Americans are about a week and a half into their social distancing, which means they're about a week and a half into only seeing the people they live with, if they live with anyone at all. In an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, 17 states have enacted \"stay at home\" policies as of Wednesday. By shuttering all non-essential businesses, banning large gatherings, and mandating that residents stay inside except for daily exercise and to get supplies, we're flattening the curve and limiting the strain on our already overwhelmed healthcare system. Nearly 100 million Americans reside in states where they're urged to avoid interacting with anyone outside of their households. \nIt's a lonely time. \nAs the COVID-19 pandemic stretches on, Twitter users are bringing back the sleep paralysis demon meme, joking that they're lonely enough to consider seeking solace in their night terrors. \nquarantine day 7: hoping my sleep paralysis demon dresses slutty tonight— halil (@astateofhalil) March 23, 2020\n\nSleep paralysis occurs during between wakefulness and sleep; those who experience it feel like they're awake, but can't move. The 8 percent of the population who have sleep paralysis report sensations like being unable to breathe, feeling a pressure on their chest, and visual and auditory hallucinations. It can be a terrifying experience, especially if you're in the limbo between consciousness and slumber. Some report a ghostly or otherworldly presence, which is their brain rationalizing the mismatch in dream cycles. \nThe sensation became a meme in early 2019, according to Know Your Meme. When a Twitter thread encouraging artists to draw their sleep paralysis demons went viral, the phrase \"sleep paralysis demon\" became a catch-all for unfortunate and cursed beings that visit in the night. \nSay hello to my personal sleep paralysis demon, @VioletChachki pic.twitter.com/7AOGVpYIeJ— Aquaria (@aquariaofficial) June 8, 2019\n\nmy sleep paralysis demon at 3am waiting for me to stop listening to sad playlists and go the sleep already so it can do its job https://t.co/xkgwu1hC1e— indie (@INDIEWASHERE) November 12, 2019\n\n\"[This] humor has been charged with making light of it by joking about spooky things,\" Know Your Meme editor Adam Downer told Mashable in a phone call. \nApproaching a year since it was born, the sleep paralysis meme has had an unusually long lifespan for anything online. But it has three key ingredients that's made it endure so long: it's easy to replicate, it's easy to personalize, and it hasn't quite blown up to the point where people are tired of it. \nThe meme might have fizzled out, if not for social distancing giving it a second wind. \nSocial distancing can save hundreds of thousands of lives, if done correctly. An early model from the New York Times estimated that with testing and effective social distancing, we could limit the number of COVID-19 cases from 9 million to 513,000. The number of coronavirus deaths would decrease from an estimated 982,000 to 51,000. Social distancing, at this point, is a necessity. \nBut it's also incredibly lonely, and estimates that this could be our reality for months make it even more daunting. \nAnd when you start feeling starved for physical affection during quarantine, cuddling up to your sleep paralysis demon starts sounding more appealing. \ntrying to give myself sleep paralysis so i can feel someone else’s touch— jebby (@lidglue) March 23, 2020\n\nso lonely in quarantine i just summoned my sleep paralysis demon for a goodnight kiss on the forehead— jen merritt!!!

You can host parties over Zoom. You can keep dating through FaceTime. You can pick up new hobbies and practice them while calling friends. You can join the hundreds of other people stocking up on sex toys to stave off the quarantine boredom. \nOr you can learn to lucid dream with your sleep paralysis demon. \nIn an age where internet humor thrives on all that is surreal and dark, joking about getting cozy with our sleep paralysis demons makes this pandemic seem less lonely. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112463%252F40bc8390-b55d-4c53-8007-803fae1144c8.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=RGSw8TLXjWivJsCdJc4qTxakHC0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112463%252F40bc8390-b55d-4c53-8007-803fae1144c8.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=AVrVzLyLxZlj3je05hu-ILjrmhM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112463%252F40bc8390-b55d-4c53-8007-803fae1144c8.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=wC5221dlddvoXicaGqOZf_8l_fY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112463%252F40bc8390-b55d-4c53-8007-803fae1144c8.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=_ZDNU5je14YN1oFYw42-jNTMDNA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112463%252F40bc8390-b55d-4c53-8007-803fae1144c8.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=A0fpSPysJYBLIvN0TwMtYRBZX58=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112463%252F40bc8390-b55d-4c53-8007-803fae1144c8.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=Gfc0QpmazhC5Jds2rBfprKU6M6I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Sleep paralysis demon memes are back since everyone's lonely while social distancing","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112463%252F40bc8390-b55d-4c53-8007-803fae1144c8.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=wC5221dlddvoXicaGqOZf_8l_fY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112463%252F40bc8390-b55d-4c53-8007-803fae1144c8.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=A0fpSPysJYBLIvN0TwMtYRBZX58=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112463%252F40bc8390-b55d-4c53-8007-803fae1144c8.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=wC5221dlddvoXicaGqOZf_8l_fY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Sleep paralysis demon memes are back since everyone's lonely while social distancing","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Hey, we're all pretty lonely and craving affection.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Sleep paralysis demon memes are back since everyone's lonely while social distancing"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":2}

You happen to be standing next to a lever that would divert the trolley onto another path, where a single person is standing. You can't save both, so you have to decide between letting the trolley take its course and kill multiple people, or be responsible for killing one person to save the others. \nThe United States is facing a parallel, but much less morally conflicting issue. The disease COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus continues to spread, despite multiple states mandating \"shelter in place\" and \"safer at home\" policies. Closing non-essential businesses is more effective for social distancing and flattening the curve, but millions are out of jobs and unable to pay their bills. \nThe stock market plummeted last week, and as Americans call on the federal government to pass relief packages for individuals in need, the Trump administration want to bail out the cruse and airline industry. Congress, meanwhile, is working on a $2 trillion stimulus package to float the country through the economic fallout. \nSEE ALSO: Coronavirus has somehow given us Shakespeare plague memes\nTrump, meanwhile, is pushing businesses to reopen. During a town hall on Tuesday, he said he wants \"packed churches\" on Easter Sunday in less than three weeks, effectively undoing nationwide social distancing efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. \n“I would love to have that. It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’d love to make it an important day for this,\" Trump said. \"I would love to have the country opened up, and rarin’ to go by Easter.”\nTwitter users are pointing out just how ridiculous the capitalist dilemma is right now — it's barely a trolley problem at all.

It's the best weapon against this virus that we've got. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112050%252Fced75c2c-ee81-4eb8-8bff-85df06d73c30.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=ScMFNQhuJE4E53cCYWdod7dnEFg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112050%252Fced75c2c-ee81-4eb8-8bff-85df06d73c30.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=AZDXK3xsIHdwK-7KOs8imDanFA0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112050%252Fced75c2c-ee81-4eb8-8bff-85df06d73c30.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Wy0p8XZSbFO9aMMBhja0DzTf9_s=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112050%252Fced75c2c-ee81-4eb8-8bff-85df06d73c30.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=YyWEaiisT9C9aJ6q5869vvXKHIE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112050%252Fced75c2c-ee81-4eb8-8bff-85df06d73c30.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=RLdVZ3SwqnyUH1gGaP2VRCC5qYQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112050%252Fced75c2c-ee81-4eb8-8bff-85df06d73c30.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=41dYLMl8LjC5HpvTXuS_rMrRKTY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Coronavirus has somehow given us Shakespeare plague memes","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112050%252Fced75c2c-ee81-4eb8-8bff-85df06d73c30.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Wy0p8XZSbFO9aMMBhja0DzTf9_s=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112050%252Fced75c2c-ee81-4eb8-8bff-85df06d73c30.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=RLdVZ3SwqnyUH1gGaP2VRCC5qYQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112050%252Fced75c2c-ee81-4eb8-8bff-85df06d73c30.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Wy0p8XZSbFO9aMMBhja0DzTf9_s=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Coronavirus has somehow given us Shakespeare plague memes","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Billy Shake was a real try-hard.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Coronavirus has somehow given us Shakespeare plague memes"},{"_id":"5e6bff5228cc367433000025","id":"/article/trump-press-conference-coronavirus-meme/","title":"Trump's COVID-19 press conference just handed us a meme format","title_tag":null,"author":"Morgan Sung","post_date":"2020-03-13T21:46:57+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 21:46:57 +0000","formatted_date":"03/13/2020","sort_key":"1JcWXT","link":"https://mashable.com/article/trump-press-conference-coronavirus-meme/","content":{"plain":"Trump's press conference declaring a nationwide state of emergency did little to quell the panic surrounding the coronavirus outbreak, but at least we got a decent meme out of it. \nDuring the conference on Friday, the president shook hands with a number of high-ranking officials from various corporations — doing the exact opposite of the social distancing we're all supposed to be practicing  — and referred to the American people as \"consumers.\" He also announced a partnership with Google, which pledged to build a site to help Americans identify symptoms of COVID-19, the official term for the disease caused by the virus, and direct them to the nearest testing site. \nThey demonstrated how the site would work on a handy flow chart. \nTrump really out here taking credit for a group project presentation his classmates did 2 hours ago using a poster board from CVS pic.twitter.com/Js3lHA39g9— Fran Tirado (@fransquishco) March 13, 2020\n\nBut if there's anything to take away from the internet, it's that holding up paper makes for prime meme material.

Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign, hoping to save face. It won’t work!\"\nThe former NYC mayor then responded with a clip directly from Star Wars, where Darth Vader strikes down Obi-Wan Kenobi in a duel.

Center for Disease Control, one of the most effective ways to protect yourself against the novel coronavirus is to avoid touching your face. This is incredibly useful advice — you shouldn't be touching your face anyway — but it's also making people realize just how much they're scratching their noses and grazing their mouths unconsciously.\nThe average person touches their face 23 times per hour. Per hour! When you realize you've been doing that for a lifetime, it can be pretty jarring, especially if you know it's best to break the habit. And what do extremely online people do when they're trying to change something about their lives?

Perkins (@AllostEricSite) February 28, 2020\n\nOf course, keeping your paws off your face is only one recommendation. There are a number of easy, free precautions you can take to protect yourself, like washing your hands frequently and keeping your devices and work surfaces clean. \nThere's still a lot of coronavirus misinformation out there, though. Take a look at the World Health Organization's myth busting page if you're unsure whether you've received good information.\nAnd if you're in the United States, there's no need to panic. Dr. Purvi Parikh, a clinical assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Health, told Mashable's Natasha Piñon on Thursday that while \"it's good to take precautions,\" US residents shouldn't freak out just yet. \nThat doesn't mean you can touch your face, though.

That was exceptional and generous and exactly right.— Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) February 24, 2020\n\n\"When Kobe Bryant died, a piece of me died,\" Jordan said through tears toward the end of his speech. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1219095%252Feeb2eb5a-f970-409c-b9fe-06403a74d52e.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=4pIYnZqzDiwc61-1YcecJEtLtE0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=FMD0Te2pXOF4jtBfYOwchfM2XCA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.png%252F356x205.png?signature=8auHCgJZmBTFN-F-wgd-y85wC1k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.png%252F712x410.png?signature=X59Fg8gGnrnSNvNoH5N3YxX6aD4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.png%252F280x157.png?signature=VcawEOZrHyxUSYnEV6FtPwbCjVU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.png%252F560x314.png?signature=IDEpFCGvn12h_Dg-YlP_-9o8cbY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Michael Jordan joked about the crying Jordan meme during powerful eulogy for Kobe Bryant","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.png%252F356x205.png?signature=8auHCgJZmBTFN-F-wgd-y85wC1k=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=s0BKlMC_LwOOQmCEAejXpFUT6wQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=NL0diB_HZje9XCF0He2RBRslKL4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.png%252F280x157.png?signature=VcawEOZrHyxUSYnEV6FtPwbCjVU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111174%252Fd03ba244-9318-4c7f-acf1-704e9f88c78d.png%252F356x205.png?signature=8auHCgJZmBTFN-F-wgd-y85wC1k=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Michael Jordan joked about the crying Jordan meme during powerful eulogy for Kobe Bryant","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"That's what Kobe Bryant does to me.\" ","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Michael Jordan joked about the crying Jordan meme during powerful eulogy for Kobe Bryant"},{"_id":"5e4d725128cc366ef0000004","id":"/article/has-the-range-meme/","title":"I don't know who needs to hear this, but the 'range' meme has the range","title_tag":null,"author":"Chloe Bryan","post_date":"2020-02-19T17:37:21+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 17:37:21 +0000","formatted_date":"02/19/2020","sort_key":"1J4P3i","link":"https://mashable.com/article/has-the-range-meme/","content":{"plain":"I'm biased toward any meme that's ever involved Wishbone, but this meme about having range actually has the range, too.\nRange — and, more importantly, whether you have it — has been part of internet lingo for a while.

Oftentimes, they start with the words, \"If you have a crush on me,\" and end with some version of, \"tell me now.\" They're straight to the point, and they never fail to amuse me.\nif you have a crush on me you’re legally obligated to tell me sorry I don’t make the rules— 𝕤𝕜 (@sophie_kibiger) February 17, 2020\n\nThe tweet format is, at its surface, a blunt and genuine invitation for potential romantic interests to reveal themselves. But it's more complex than that. The request is also a lightly veiled way to broadcast your relationship status and admit your desire to find love. The fact that you're putting out a public call for a significant other in such a lighthearted way lets people know that you're mostly poking fun at yourself, and that your hopes for actual success from the tweet aren't very high.\nSEE ALSO: We need to cool it with extremely violent horny hyperboles\nThe beauty of \"If you have a crush on me\" tweets is that they can be fired off any day of the year, but they often surge in popularity before major events like holidays, or amidst chaotic political happenings.\nSome people encourage crushes to come out of hiding in the days leading up to a birthday or romance-centered occasion, like Valentine’s Day. But others save the requests until more concerning matters present themselves. On a normal day you might not feel like pouring your heart out to Twitter and begging for romantic interests to reveal themselves, but if there's talk of another world war, why not shoot your shot, right?\nAnyone wanna admit they got a crush on me now that World War 3 is about to happen...— Polo (@drippedgucci) January 3, 2020\n\nBefore climate change wipes out our cursed species in 2050 anybody wanna admit they got a crush on me?— Juventud (@speakz) June 3, 2019\n\nWhile there’s definitely a level of sincerity to crush-coaxing tweets, I can’t help but find them funny. It’s clear that anyone tweeting the requests couldn’t care less what people think about their love lives, which makes them shameless in the best way. By tweeting \"If anyone has a crush on me, tell me now\" you’re completely owning your lack of suitors and taking charge of the situation, which is actually pretty inspiring. \nReveal yourself \"before I spend my money...\"\n\"If anyone has a crush on me tweets\" vary in structure, but as people have started adding their own personal flair to the format, a common theme has emerged: Retail therapy.\nIn some cases, people present an ultimatum of sorts. They’ll ask for crushes to reveal themselves, then disclose that if no crushes come forward they’ll be forced to spend money on distractions — such as video games, clothes, comfort food, and even drugs or alcohol — to help mend their lonely hearts.\nAnyone gonna admit they have a crush on me and ask me to be their valentine before I spend all my Valentine’s money on the animal crossing preorder— cal?

It lets potential crushes know that someone has love to give, sure, but also the financial resources necessary to buy a gift, pay for a date, or invest in a relationship. Before the request gets too serious, though, you make it clear that if no one reaches out not only will you survive, you'll spend that cash on yourself.\nThe \"keep it to yourself\" crowd\nWhile most people who use the \"if you have a crush on me\" prompt are searching for someone who admires them, others use the format to beg followers to keep all their crushes secret.\nWhether the realization of someone having a crush on them would be too overwhelming, or they're afraid of being put in an uncomfortable or unrequited crush situation, some people tweet things like, \"If you have a crush on me, now's the time to keep it to yourself.\"\nIt's cuffing season so if you have a crush on me now's the time to keep it to yourself, I'm busy— 𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘺 ☽ (@inbroco) November 29, 2019\n\nit's midnight on the last day of the decade 💕 if you have a crush on me now's the time to keep that shit to yourself.— alexis nedd (@alexisthenedd) December 31, 2019\n\nIf you have a crush on me you are legally obligated to reveal yourself today!!!

It is very short notice and coming up with the right gift for someone gives me anxiety. Thank you.— Tim Hippensteel (@TimHippensteel) February 2, 2020\n\nWhile these versions of the tweet are definitely lacking in the romance department, they're still funny in a \"Don't you dare put one more thing on my plate\" type of way.\nWhy are we so willing to tweet about crushes?\nAs a proud member of Crush Twitter, I believe that airing the occasional crush-related frustration or making light of unrequited love or lack of a significant other is a classic coping mechanism.\nBeing single is great, but navigating life without a special someone to share your highs and lows with can be tough — especially when you're surrounded by other people in relationships. Many choose to keep their love lives private online, but tweeting about crushes has a certain level of anonymity to it, so it lets you declare that you're thinking about love without sharing anything too personal.\nIn times when you're feeling particularly lonely, consider tweeting a personalized version of \"If you have a crush on me, tell me now.\" It's funny, cathartic, and who knows, maybe you'll actually encourage someone who has a secret crush on you to slide into your DMs."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110735%252F3b72b6a5-1421-4678-9238-e6ba2d65b4cf.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=vCdFgs3_0qrhIGrtD5viXPTWBko=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110735%252F3b72b6a5-1421-4678-9238-e6ba2d65b4cf.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=y41YMAkf-rIhwpDIuSmt4iFK89I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110735%252F3b72b6a5-1421-4678-9238-e6ba2d65b4cf.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Ptn1WTnZGoaKIfjJ_JoU8LRrCu0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110735%252F3b72b6a5-1421-4678-9238-e6ba2d65b4cf.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=ZodzdhrkO16htJAHTf1BfYr8Ols=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110735%252F3b72b6a5-1421-4678-9238-e6ba2d65b4cf.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=JPkAXUKzOq5MwYWGJV4RJ1gU7eY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110735%252F3b72b6a5-1421-4678-9238-e6ba2d65b4cf.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=qQD-cA2DCeYUX26LzgW-3olHvn4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'If you have a crush on me, tell me now' tweets never get old","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110735%252F3b72b6a5-1421-4678-9238-e6ba2d65b4cf.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Ptn1WTnZGoaKIfjJ_JoU8LRrCu0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110735%252F3b72b6a5-1421-4678-9238-e6ba2d65b4cf.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=JPkAXUKzOq5MwYWGJV4RJ1gU7eY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110735%252F3b72b6a5-1421-4678-9238-e6ba2d65b4cf.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=Ptn1WTnZGoaKIfjJ_JoU8LRrCu0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"'If you have a crush on me, tell me now' tweets never get old","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"They're shameless and I love them.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"'If you have a crush on me, tell me now' tweets never get old"}]
