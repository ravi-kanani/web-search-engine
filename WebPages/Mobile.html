The upcoming Galaxy Z Flip, the clamshell phone Samsung is set to unveil alongside its new S20 line, is likely to have a crease in its display, according to a new rumor.\nThe new detail is once again from XDA Developers' Max Weinbach who has been leaking up a storm about the upcoming Z Flip and S20 lineup. According to Weinbach, the Z Flip will use \"Samsung Ultra Thin Glass,\" instead of the plastic display used on the Galaxy Fold. Again, this is an unverified rumor, but it is in line with previous reports that the company has been developing a glass display for foldable devices.  So while a screen with a visible crease may sound less than ideal, the quality of the display should be better overall if it indeed uses glass instead of plastic. \nSo Galaxy Z Flip. Capacitive fingerprint scanner on the side. Dual 12MP cameras, wide and ultra wide. 15W charging. Wireless charging and reverse wireless charging are supported. It will use \"Samsung Ultra Thin Glass\" which has crease. It will use a Dynamic AMOLED display.— Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) January 23, 2020\n\nBesides the crease, Weinbach also reports that the foldable phone will have a fingerprint sensor on the side of the device, as well as dual 12 MP cameras. The phone will also feature one of the cooler tricks of last year's S10: reverse wireless charging.\nEven with a crease, much of what we've heard about the Z Flip sounds promising. A clamshell design makes a lot more sense from a usability point of view and the ability to \"lock\" the phone in a 90-degree position could open up some interesting use cases. It also has the advantage of playing up flip phone nostalgia, which we know from Motorola's upcoming launch of the Razr is still going strong.\nBut for critics, the crease could prove difficult to ignore. As Mashable previously noted in last year's review of the Fold, the crease was a near-constant reminder of the phone's imperfections. The good news, at least, is that if Samsung does end up using a new material for the Z Flip, it could potentially make the crease less visible and, hopefully, more durable. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1166759%252Fa6f76b32-9461-4204-832b-c192f99954ca.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=xZVc1wv-9LT8o-S5rg-bnp5cqJ4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109719%252Fffa64951-2830-4550-b211-6813e2fc818a.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=eaSpuDMLcJe2hmGNXbysh3h0LO4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109719%252Fffa64951-2830-4550-b211-6813e2fc818a.jpg%252F800x360.jpg?signature=QWMqKjPGgFuOViIHbguXn6xRTRE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109719%252Fffa64951-2830-4550-b211-6813e2fc818a.jpg%252F1600x720.jpg?signature=c5wKnQkZY13mWnN2CgxZrS1JIig=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Samsung's next foldable phone could have that dreaded crease","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109719%252Fffa64951-2830-4550-b211-6813e2fc818a.jpg%252F800x360.jpg?signature=QWMqKjPGgFuOViIHbguXn6xRTRE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109719%252Fffa64951-2830-4550-b211-6813e2fc818a.webp%252F800x360.webp?signature=TN7RZnDQG69hwCPLvXsGaHXVfDU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","naturalWidth":"800","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109719%252Fffa64951-2830-4550-b211-6813e2fc818a.jpg%252F800x360.jpg?signature=QWMqKjPGgFuOViIHbguXn6xRTRE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","sizes":"800w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Samsung's next foldable phone could have that dreaded crease","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It could be making a comeback.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Samsung's next foldable phone could have that dreaded crease"}

At least, if the latest rumors are any indication. \nWhile we've already heard that the phone, which will reportedly be called the Galaxy Z Flip, will have a clamshell design, we now know a bit more about how that folding screen will work. \nThe new details come from XDA Developers' Max Weinbach who reports the Z Flip will have the ability to \"lock\" at a 90-degree angle, which allows the bottom half of the phone to act as a kickstand. Apps, including the phone's camera, will be able to take advantage of this orientation, which sounds particularly useful for video calls or watching short videos. Weinbach also says the Flip will reprise another notable feature from the original flip phone era: ending phone calls by folding it closed. \nBasically, it locks into this position and more than just the camera will be supported pic.twitter.com/nmD8sraRx2— Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) January 22, 2020\n\nNotably, this is all a bit different than how Motorola's Razr works. Though that phone also has a clamshell design, its hinge can't \"lock\" in a 90-degree position. Instead, it uses a smaller, secondary screen you can use with some apps, like Google's Duo, when the phone is folded up. \nThe Z Flip, on the other hand, will use a single, reportedly 6.7-inch display that can adapt to two different orientations.\nOf course, these are all still unverified rumors for now, but the new details are in line with a concept the company previously teased at its developer conference last year. In the video, Samsung showed off how a phone with a clamshell design might be able to use a folding screen as the kind of kickstand Weinbach mentioned. \nThe new rumors come just weeks ahead of Samsung's Unpacked event. In addition to the rumored Galaxy Z Flip, the company is expected to show off its next lineup of 5G-ready flagship phones, the Galaxy S20. \nBut it's the Galaxy Z Flip that's a bigger question mark. After last year's bungled Galaxy Fold rollout, pressure will be intense for Samsung to show off a foldable phone that's actually ready for the spotlight. Which makes the little we know about Z Flip all the more intriguing. While the Galaxy Fold's design was thick and awkward — to say nothing of that crease — the Z Flip sounds like it could take advantage of its foldable screen in a way that actually makes sense. \nAnd by using a clamshell design, Samsung will not only get to take advantage of flip phone nostalgia, it makes the phone a lot easier to handle. Instead of a device that's awkwardly bulky and wide, you might actually be able to use it one-handed. \nEven so, there's still a ton we don't know, including the price or most of the specs. The good news is that we won't have much longer to wait: Unpacked is Feb. 11. Now, we just have to hope that there's no crease."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=0qEE07FeVJwLOe_eZMcSa4nSPUg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=pA7LNYgBSNhI3NLH22YKldSf8VY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F280x158.png?signature=bEJrZ6aChDnZh4YDalugKbaA724=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F560x316.png?signature=bE3S2LrjB9ZuEPAHYK3BUsWRSow=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Samsung's new foldable phone already sounds way better than the Galaxy Fold","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F280x158.png?signature=bEJrZ6aChDnZh4YDalugKbaA724=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F280x158.png?signature=bEJrZ6aChDnZh4YDalugKbaA724=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Samsung's new foldable phone already sounds way better than the Galaxy Fold","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The hype is getting real.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Samsung's new foldable phone already sounds way better than the Galaxy Fold"},{"_id":"5d98f8932463a3232b000001","id":"/article/pixel-4-google-assistant-raise-to-talk/","title":"Pixel 4 could come with a brand new way to use Google Assistant","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2019-10-05T20:09:52+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 05 Oct 2019 20:09:52 +0000","formatted_date":"10/05/2019","sort_key":"1IgQne","link":"https://mashable.com/article/pixel-4-google-assistant-raise-to-talk/","content":{"plain":"It might seem like almost every detail of Google's upcoming Pixel 4 has already been leaked, and yet fresh details are somehow still emerging.\nNow we have another intriguing feature to consider, relating to how Pixel 4 will interact with Google Assistant. The phones will come with an all-new way to invoke Google Assistant, according to a report from 9to5Google, which says Pixel 4 could include a new \"raise to talk\" feature. \nAny time you want to ask Google Assistant a question, you can just pick up your phone and start speaking, rather than saying \"Hey Google,\" or holding the home button.\n9to5Google reports:\nAfter lifting your phone up, asking a question or issuing a command will invoke Assistant. Your speech has to come immediately after the raise or Google will ignore it. The company is privacy-conscious about this feature and will note that voice recognition happens on-device.\nGoogle wouldn't be the first to implement such a feature. The Apple Watch has long had an optional \"raise to speak\" feature for Siri commands. But there are some bigger implications for Google, as 9to5 notes. Such a feature could raise significant privacy concerns, as the lack of a specific keyword or button push could trigger unintentional Google Assistant queries. (And let's not forget it was only a couple months ago that Google was forced to do some explaining after some users' conversations with the virtual assistant were leaked by a contract worker.) \nTo mitigate some of these concerns, Google reportedly plans to keep Pixel 4's voice recognition on the device itself, and not in the cloud. \nThere's also some question about whether \"raise to talk\" will launch with Pixel 4 or come in a later update. Google is also reported to be readying several other improvements to its assistant, including the ability to wait on hold during phone calls.\nSoftware details will likely be among the few remaining surprises when Pixel 4 launches later in October. Google itself has already shown off what the phones look like, and teased new gesture recognition capabilities. Leakers have since shown off photos of the phones, along with the entire spec sheet.\nGoogle will officially unveil the Pixel 4 at its annual Made by Google event on Oct. 15. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1058375%252Fb11d45cd-14b6-4c1e-a717-e00c9dbb9647.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=DL3AfrEzcL547LPZk7mBjO9m1jA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104193%252F121eda5b-26f8-48d9-91ad-1c7de14ffe69.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=nEXx-PKbuyxrebvtLStDAs3w2Rs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104193%252F121eda5b-26f8-48d9-91ad-1c7de14ffe69.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=o8ZfECnw-ozvXM9DGR4da2iogVw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104193%252F121eda5b-26f8-48d9-91ad-1c7de14ffe69.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=zmMzAaeWaLKv4DR69TxpV1XSO88=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

Apple Watch Series 5, Apple unveiled its most advanced iPhones to date: the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro and 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max.\nBecause I know you're dying to know: The camera bump on the rear with protruding triple lenses is real and it's big. You'll probably get over it quickly.\nThe more important question is whether the iPhone 11 Pro offers compelling enough features to earn its pro name. Is it worth spending at least $999 instead of $699 for the iPhone 11?\nIt's impossible for me to answer that from my short hands-on time with the iPhone 11 Pro and Max, but I can tell you this: There's a ton to unpack.\nDoesn't attract as many fingerprints\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pros don't have a revolutionary new design (that's supposed to come in 2020), so it's mostly a glass-and-metal sandwich evolved from the iPhone X.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pros come in two display sizes: 5.8 inches and 6.5 inches for the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, respectively. However, the Super Retina XDR OLED displays have been enhanced with higher contrast ratio (2,000,000:1) and increased brightness (up to 1,200 nits).\nThe most noticeable visual change on the iPhone 11 Pros is the matte glass back. It repels fingerprints way better. Don't believe me? See for yourself:\n\niPhone 11 Pro does a great job not picking up fingerprints #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/x7nbXuuWvk— Raymond Wong📱💾📼 (@raywongy) September 10, 2019\n\nThe glass is also tougher. Take a coin or key to the phone, and you'll be shocked to see the scratch marks on the matte glass rubs right off. It's kinda nuts.\nOf the four colors the iPhone 11 Pros are available in (Space Gray, silver, gold, and a new Midnight Green), I liked Space Gray the most. The new Midnight Green will no doubt be the one everyone pines for, but I kind of wish Apple gave the iPhone 11 Pros more vibrant hues, like the lavender and sea foam green reserved for the iPhone 11.\n\nApple's also pushed the Apple logo lower and removed the \"iPhone\" text from the back. Contrary to earlier rumors, the Apple logo doesn't double as a marker for wireless charging AirPods or an Apple Watch — there's no such \"reverse\" or \"bilateral\" wireless charging feature on any of the iPhone 11 Pros.\nThe huge squircle-shaped camera bump, which is nearly twice the size of the pill-shaped bump on the iPhone XS, is also ... not ideal.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the bump really isn't as terrible in person. It's translucent-ish and looks better than it appeared in leaked photos and renders. However, the three lenses raised on top of the bigger bump isn't the most stylish. I'm sure the bump will become a non-issue over time, but it's still kind of disappointing from such a design-focused company like Apple.\nI also noticed the iPhone 11 Pros are slightly thicker and heavier than the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. Not considerably bulkier, but holding them in my hands made me really miss the super thin and light days of the iPhone 6.\nThe iPhone 11 Pros have the same A13 Bionic chip as the iPhone 11. Apple says it's the most powerful chip in a smartphone with the fastest CPU and GPU performance. I believe it because every Android phone with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chip still lags compared to the iPhone XS's A12 Bionic chip.\nTriple camera delight\nThe iPhone 11 Pros' best feature is easily the new triple camera system, which now includes an ultra-wide lens alongside the main wide lens and 2x telephoto lens.\nAll three cameras have 12 megapixels of resolution. The main wide camera has an f/1.8 aperture, which means it can let in the most amount of light for the best low-light photos; the 2x telephoto camera has an improved f/2.0 aperture for better low-light shooting as well; and the new ultra-wide camera has an f/2.4 aperture and a 120-degree field of view. (Apple says you can squeeze in 4x more into a photo compared to the wide camera).\nApple revamped the camera app to take advantage of the three lenses. Above the carousel of shooting modes, there are toggles for the three cameras: 0.5x (ultra wide), 1x (main), and 2x (telephoto). \nUltra wide on iPhone 11 #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/Kvldh2iYFT— Raymond Wong📱💾📼 (@raywongy) September 10, 2019\n\nThese are simple enough to use and you can also press and hold on the zoom buttons and swipe up and down to bring up a zoom ring.\nHaving used ultra-wide cameras on Android phones such as the Galaxy Note 10 and OnePlus 7 Pro, it's definitely great to see the iPhone finally get one as well.\nUnfortunately, I couldn't determine if the iPhone 11 Pros' ultra-wide camera is superior to the ones on Android phones. The few ultra-wide photos I took inside of the brightly lit Steve Jobs Theater looked good with seemingly sharper image quality from corner-to-corner compared to the Note 10, but I'll obviously need to put it through shoots in the real world later.\nLike the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pros boast improved video recording. All three cameras and the front-facing camera can now record in 4K resolution at up to 60 frames per second. Apple says there's improved audio recording for video as well and better High Dynamic Range (HDR), which I'll also have to test later.\nSlow motion video recording with the higher resolution 12-megapixel selfie cameras is fun, too:\nRecorded a slofi with @karissabe #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/3wE3NJbK47— Raymond Wong📱💾📼 (@raywongy) September 10, 2019\n\nThe one camera feature I couldn't try out was Night Mode. The demo area inside of the Steve Jobs Theater was bright and Night Mode only automatically kicks in when the camera detects a dark scene. An iPhone 11 Pro product person told me a timer appears in the camera app and counts you down to the number of seconds you need to hold the iPhone steady; the duration varies depending on the amount of luminance.\nMore bang for your $1,000\n\nWith a starting price of $999 for the iPhone 11 Pro and $1,099 for the iPhone 11 Pro Max, these phones still command premium prices. Moreover, $699 for the iPhone 11 is even more affordable than the iPhone XR was when it launched for $749. It's easily the better deal since with the iPhone 11, you still get the Pro's ultra-wide lens (you just don't get the telephoto).\nAn included 18-watt fast charger, 4 to 5 hours of longer battery life, better water and dust resistance, and faster Face ID unlock, round out the iPhone 11 Pros feature set. Plus, you also get a year of Apple TV+ for free with each device.\nAfter playing with the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, I'm not as offended by the camera bump. I'm more interested in how the cameras compare to the latest and greatest Android phones. For that, I'll have to wait until I can test them properly.\nWATCH: The iPhone 11 event in 90 seconds"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1045977%252Fa0d08b57-cea7-4537-ae17-b41afd63cdc2.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=HBVj5SkgY0kvB-D3pEFEswLxokY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102755%252Fc4bb7a32-b50f-4ca6-928e-542855e3c2c3.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=Qj_TSvIBVO7BRzVy4qpOXCVHW54=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102755%252Fc4bb7a32-b50f-4ca6-928e-542855e3c2c3.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=IFcmG4FqFsiipb3lsHHDSpHTt4g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102755%252Fc4bb7a32-b50f-4ca6-928e-542855e3c2c3.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=aTtk0vrx7QgnzwoGsajryXj9hmg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"iPhone 11 Pro competes with Android where it matters most: The camera","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102755%252Fc4bb7a32-b50f-4ca6-928e-542855e3c2c3.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=IFcmG4FqFsiipb3lsHHDSpHTt4g=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102755%252Fc4bb7a32-b50f-4ca6-928e-542855e3c2c3.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=IFcmG4FqFsiipb3lsHHDSpHTt4g=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"iPhone 11 Pro competes with Android where it matters most: The camera","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"OBlPBrJ20X","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"You'll get over the bump fast.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"iPhone 11 Pro competes with Android where it matters most: The camera"}]

They'll be the most advanced iPhones ever (because of course they'll be). \nWith new cameras (two on the iPhone 11 and three on the 11 Pro), they'll likely push photography and video recording to new heights.\nNothing wrong with better cameras, but if you're hoping for Apple to wow with iPhones that are, perhaps, more revolutionary instead of iterative, you'll probably have to wait until 2020.\nSEE ALSO: How to watch Apple's big iPhone event\nIf all the rumors and leaks ending up being correct — they're almost always right these days — the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be somewhat modest updates.\nFrom the front, the iPhone 11 should look like the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 Pros should resemble the iPhone XS and XS Max: same screen sizes, notches, and bezel thicknesses.\nThe cameras will likely be better, too: dual cameras on the iPhone 11 and triple cameras on the iPhone 11 Pros.\nInside, Apple is expected to improve performance with a new A13 chip and Ultra Wide Band wireless technology in an \"R1\" sensor for more precise location tracking (possibly related to the rumored Tile-like item tracker), more responsive Face ID unlock, and reverse wireless charging for juicing up AirPods and Apple Watch.\nAll of these features will no doubt be good additions to the iPhone, but will they drum up the same kind of mass hype that past iPhones used to? Probably not.\nNext year's iPhones, however, could be the real deal — the first major update to the iPhone since the iPhone X was released in 2017.\nIt's way too early to declare any rumored features for the iPhone 2020 are a lock. But considering the source, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, has a long history accurately predicting new features based on information from the supply chain, the rumors have more weight.\nSo what are we hearing? A lot, actually.\nRedesign: Apple last gave the iPhone a physical refresh with the iPhone X, ditching the rectangle display and home button for an edge-to-edge display with rounded corners and Face ID. For 2020, Kuo says Apple's cooking up an \"all-new form factor design.\" \nWhat that actually means is unclear. I, personally, would love a boxier industrial design with flat edges similar to the iPad Pro. I'd also like to see the camera bump become flush with the body again, too.\nRegardless, the iPhone X design will look super outdated by 2020. Hopefully, Apple has something dazzling up its sleeve.\nNew display sizes: Along with the design revamp, Kuo says Apple might introduce new display sizes. Currently, the iPhone lineup includes a 6.1-inch iPhone XR, 5.8-inch iPhone XS, and 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max.\nFor 2020, Kuo says Apple's gonna switch to a smaller 5.4-inch iPhone and larger 6.7-inch iPhone. No word on whether the 6.1-inch iPhone will also get shrunk or enlarged.\nNew screen sizes could appeal to people who miss smaller iPhones of yesteryear and people who want an almost tablet-like experience.\nIn-display Touch ID: The iPhone X killed Touch ID and replaced it with Face ID, but the fingerprint sensor might return inside the 2020 iPhone's display. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, another reliable source on Apple, says the 2020 iPhone will have an in-display Touch ID that'll be complementary to Face ID.\nGurman's report corroborates an earlier investor note from Kuo, who also predicts Apple will add an in-display Touch ID sensor.\nIf you dislike Face ID because it's slower than Touch ID, 2020's iPhone could bring the good ol' finger biometric.\n5G: Wireless carriers have started lighting up select cities with 5G and companies like Samsung and OnePlus already have 5G-enabled phones. The popularity of iPhones, however, will no doubt help usher in faster 5G networks in big ways. Who doesn't want gigabit download speeds that'll burn through your monthly data plan in seconds?\nUSB-C port: Apple switched to the reversible Lightning port in 2012 with the iPhone 5. Lightning did its job, but it's time to move on to USB-C, which is also reversible, and is capable of faster data output. \nApple's other devices like the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro and MacBook Air all switched to USB-C. With a redesign, when better than to switch to the unofficial universal port? \nHow to wait until 2020\nAs you can see, there's a lot to look forward to on the iPhone 2020 (assuming these features end up shaking out, of course).\nBut the wait until the fall of 2020, when Apple's likely to release these new iPhones, is a long one. How can you hold out until then?\nIf you own an iPhone and the battery no longer lasts as long anymore, consider getting the battery replaced or opt for a battery pack, like Apple's Smart Battery Case. \nUpdating your device to iOS 13 will also breathe new life into it with new features like Dark Mode and a revamped Photos app.\nWATCH: Apple’s iPhone 11 event coming Sept.

11\" and \"iPhone 11 Pro\") because the 2020 iPhones sound way more groundbreaking.\nAccording to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac), the 2020 iPhones will reportedly come with a major redesign. \nIn a new note to investors, Kuo says the coming year's iPhones will have \"an all-new form factor design\" as well as \"5G support\" and \"camera function upgrades.\"\nHe believes these three key upgrades will boost stagnating iPhone sales to new year-over-year growth.\nSEE ALSO: What to expect from Apple's 'iPhone 11' event on Sept. 10\nThough Kuo didn't share details on what an \"all-new form factor design\" could mean, we'd be down for an industrial design that's similar to latest iPad Pros, which sport corners, flat sides, and a camera bump that doesn't look completely terrible.\nThat said, it's difficult to imagine Apple returning to an aluminum design for the body. Apple switched to glass starting with the iPhone 8 and iPhone X to enable wireless charging. Metal, as we already know, doesn't play very nicely with wireless charging. And with Apple expected to add \"reverse wireless charging\" on this year's iPhone 11 Pro to charge up AirPods, it seems even more unlikely we'll get a metal iPhone in 2020.\nStill, a new form factor could mean many things. A smaller notch, in-display Touch ID, depth sensor on the rear for augmented reality, and USB-C port instead of Lightning are all features that are rumored for the 2020 iPhone. Apple is also expected to add 5G to next year's iPhones.\nKuo previously claimed the 2020 iPhones would come in new screen sizes: 5.4 inch and 6.7 inch, to replace the current 5.8 inch and 6.5 inch displays. A 6.1-inch iPhone (most likely a third-generation iPhone XR) will remain in the lineup as well.\nThis year's iPhone will be the third iteration of the iPhone X's design, which came out in 2017. Though revolutionary at the time, smartphone makers quickly caught up and surpassed the iPhone X with even bolder edge-to-edge designs without notches. \nPhones such as the OnePlus 7 Pro and Galaxy

because Touch ID is gone, you might only have to wait another year.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple is reportedly testing iPhone prototypes with a new version of its Touch ID fingerprint sensor that's embedded in the display instead of inside a physical home button.\nThe new in-display Touch ID would let \"a user scan their fingerprint on a large portion of the display, and it would work in tandem with the existing Face ID system.\"\nSEE ALSO: What to expect from Apple's 'iPhone 11' event on Sept. 10\nThe report corroborates an investor note by TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said last month that Apple was planning to resurrect the fingerprint sensor for iPhones slated for 2021.\nBloomberg's report, however, suggests Apple could be readying the new Touch ID for iPhones for 2020 — a year earlier if testing is successful. \nApple replaced Touch ID with Face ID on the iPhone X in 2017, and the latest iPhones — the iPhone XS and iPhone XR — don't have a fingerprint sensor, either. \nFace ID was touted as a more secure form of biometric security for iPhones compared to Touch ID. Apple's SVP of marketing, Phil Schiller, said that with Touch ID, there's a 1 in 50,000 chance of somebody else unlocking your iPhone versus 1 in a million chance with Face ID.\nDespite the extra security, there are still many skeptics of Face ID. For example, as we've proven, if you have a twin, there's a very high chance they could fool Face ID. Unlocking your iPhone with Face ID is also slower than Touch ID and doesn't work unless you hold your device in the correct orientation. \nThe upcoming iOS 13 does make Face ID 30 percent faster, and the new iPhone 11 and 11 Pro are rumored to come with improved sensors to make the face recognition even more responsive, but some people just want a fingerprint reader.\nHow to make Touch ID inside the display work\nAs Bloomberg and Ming-Chi Kuo both note, any iPhone with an in-display Touch ID wouldn't be a replacement for Face ID (it's here to stay), but would be in addition to face unlock. Apple may let users choose to turn on just one of the biometrics, or both for added security.\nThe key difference with this new Touch ID sensor would be that it covers a \"large portion of the display.\" As we've seen on many Android phones like the Galaxy S10, Galaxy Note 10, and OnePlus 7 Pro, the in-display fingerprint sensors cover only a very small part of the screen, which makes it harder to get a scan of your fingerprint, especially at angles.\nIf Apple can implement a Touch ID sensor that covers, perhaps, the bottom half of the screen — something like the \"Half-Screen In-Display Fingerprint Scanning Technology\" sensor Vivo showed off with its Apex FullView concept phone — it would likely solve the many responsiveness issues that are, in my opinion, ruining otherwise great phones.\nNew iPhone SE successor?\nIn addition to a new iPhone with Touch ID, Bloomberg also claims Apple's working on a new low-cost iPhone to potentially succeed the now discontinued iPhone SE. The affordable iPhone is said to have a 4.7-inch LCD screen and home button with Touch ID; it sounds like a stripped-down version of the iPhone 8, which was the last iPhone with a home button and fingerprint reader.\nAlthough new iPhones will be announced on Sept. 10, the 2020 iPhone(s) already sound a whole lot more revolutionary. So far, we've got a potential redesign, in-display Touch ID, 5G, and the addition of a 3D-depth sensor on the rear for augmented reality. \nIf you don't need to upgrade your iPhone, maybe wait it out another year.\nWATCH: Apple’s iPhone 11 event coming Sept. 10"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1043148%252F00dbb58c-da9e-4ac8-96b3-962f21964773.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=QMlOp-Cya-IxSwJO_dPGPmcviVU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102431%252F24197382-1988-4e97-8499-d643ab6925e0.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=9iMj0Mj3XcJsdEc0OK0Alj8fnts=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102431%252F24197382-1988-4e97-8499-d643ab6925e0.png%252F356x205.png?signature=C4HEySLLV_ub6eabhyDx5J7S_xk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102431%252F24197382-1988-4e97-8499-d643ab6925e0.png%252F712x410.png?signature=s33-iLlqSoubZ91EuC7YGU66a_k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102431%252F24197382-1988-4e97-8499-d643ab6925e0.png%252F280x157.png?signature=MNCtZ_1crrs6K7UvTev3_aczU70=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102431%252F24197382-1988-4e97-8499-d643ab6925e0.png%252F560x314.png?signature=tkPA8buDNyG7JjZRWci68I4vWmA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Touch ID might be coming back!","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1043148%252F00dbb58c-da9e-4ac8-96b3-962f21964773.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1043148%252F00dbb58c-da9e-4ac8-96b3-962f21964773.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png","micro":1},"src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1043148%252F00dbb58c-da9e-4ac8-96b3-962f21964773.png%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=YckEhilL2d2RQjQsH4Fav0eV954=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1043148%252F00dbb58c-da9e-4ac8-96b3-962f21964773.png%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=HaayYBtGBXJ8JGA0j3qodUJjWdw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Touch ID might be coming back!"}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  lili sams / mashable"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"2020 iPhone might have Touch ID inside the screen","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"EGoAgM4dn1","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Next year's iPhone is shaping up to be way better TBH.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"2020 iPhone might have Touch ID inside the screen"},{"_id":"5d67e96a2463a3728100003c","id":"/article/huawei-mate-30-screwed-no-google-services/","title":"Huawei's Mate 30 is so screwed without Google services","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2019-08-29T15:04:07+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 15:04:07 +0000","formatted_date":"08/29/2019","sort_key":"1I3tA5","link":"https://mashable.com/article/huawei-mate-30-screwed-no-google-services/","content":{"plain":"Huawei's next flagship Android smartphone, the Mate 30, will ship with a major disadvantage when it launches on Sept. 18.\nDue to the ongoing ban on U.S. companies working with Huawei, the company's upcoming Mate 30 will not ship with Google Play, which means users will not be able to access services like the Google Play app store, Gmail, or Google Maps, according to Reuters.\nIn the U.S. and Europe, Google Play services are deemed essential to Android devices. Without Google services, smartphones are basically \"useless\" insists my colleague Stan Schroeder, who's reviewed Huawei phones without them.\nSEE ALSO: Huawei's foldable Mate X reportedly faces another delay\nIn China, though, the Mate 30 won't be as crippled since Google and its services are banned, and Chinese alternatives such as Baidu and Youku exist to replace them.\nAccording to Reuters, the Mate 30 will still ship with Android — the operating system is open source and free for any company to use and modify — but the lack of the Play Store and Google's services could seriously impact Huawei's phone sales in the west.\nThe Mate 30 could take a serious beating particularly in Europe, where Huawei previously saw a 60% increase in phone sales from 2017-2018, but watched as sales plummeted 40% a month after the U.S. blacklisted the company and banned American companies from working with it.\nFor Huawei, the Mate 30 will be a test of not just its technology, but its brand. Can the Chinese company's phones still be successful without Google? Sure, it can in China, where it's the No. 1 smartphone maker. But in the west, where Google's services are core to the Android platform, Huawei doesn't stand much of a chance.\nThere's no doubt the the Mate 30 (and its Mate 30 Pro variant) will be an impressive smartphone — rumors already suggest it'll be packed from top to bottom with seemingly every feature imaginable — but great hardware alone isn't enough anymore. Without essential services, a new phone is just a  pretty metal-and-glass slab.\nHuawei's best bet for the future is to reduce its reliance on Google services and American companies so that it can't be used as a bargaining chip in any trade wars. \nThe company's developing its own \"Harmony OS,\" but it's a long way off from being ready for smartphones. The biggest challenge will be getting third-party developers to port their apps to another platform.\nWe'll see if Huawei's Mate 30 will sink or swim, but it's not looking good so far.\nWATCH: The

Rumors suggest the rear bump will house two cameras -- a main camera and a telephoto camera -- and, possibly, a spectral sensor similar to the Pixel 3. \nThe fingerprint reader on the back is also going to be replaced by a Face ID-like face unlock feature. Google announced in July the Pixel 4's face unlock works in almost any orientation and uses a Soli radar sensor to detect when you're near the phone and then unlocks \"in one motion.\"\nThe Soli radar sensor also has another trick: hand gestures. Called \"Motion Sense,\" you'll be able to wave your hand in front of the Pixel 4 to do things like \"skip songs, snooze alarms, and silence phone calls.\" \nSEE ALSO: Own Google's first Pixel or Pixel XL? You could claim up to $500.\nAnd that's about all we know about the Pixel 4 so far. If Google follows previous releases, the phone will come in two sizes and likely come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855, Android 10, hopefully more RAM (the Pixel 3's performance has tanked with new updates because it has so little RAM), and larger batteries.\nIn previous years, Google released the original Pixel on Oct. 20, 2016; the Pixel 2 on Oct. 19, 2017; and Pixel 3 on Oct. 18, 2018. Unless Google bucks tradition, expect the Pixel 4 to launch in late October 2019.\nWATCH: Does the Google Pixel 3 have the best smartphone camera? — Mashable Reviews"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1039502%252Fc980f49f-4c8c-4efb-b97c-b6bafb224a75.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=baE57pGyO9iIMOgiWztif2C1dD8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F101992%252F04b4f53b-8766-4116-8800-dbb5d96df995.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=y5r7kZ019SbQBIrshpgAbLRNRIA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F101992%252F04b4f53b-8766-4116-8800-dbb5d96df995.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=1-9sEG2qHFE_dveg9dIJBkJ_hU0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F101992%252F04b4f53b-8766-4116-8800-dbb5d96df995.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=xKDMaiJ_3NXzmSvJVTf5VXX_l0s=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F101992%252F04b4f53b-8766-4116-8800-dbb5d96df995.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=mG_R8816nUsY8NsiZcKgH_SJvSY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F101992%252F04b4f53b-8766-4116-8800-dbb5d96df995.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=PIlLHNjtzSEmNgHAbpoR3PQ5wPU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"The Pixel 4's coming really soon.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1039502%252Fc980f49f-4c8c-4efb-b97c-b6bafb224a75.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1039502%252Fc980f49f-4c8c-4efb-b97c-b6bafb224a75.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1039502%252Fc980f49f-4c8c-4efb-b97c-b6bafb224a75.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=SzYxZ6NXIBP99UA1t6u_XMJrysI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1039502%252Fc980f49f-4c8c-4efb-b97c-b6bafb224a75.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=L6yJaashSVH321oz1UUn_dSaVl0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"The Pixel 4's coming really soon."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  google"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Leaked Google Pixel 4 photos confirm questionable design choices","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"yanmAekrnK","data-ytid":"RL2p3QMD6-4","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"No notch, but one thick top bezel and a huge camera bump.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Leaked Google Pixel 4 photos confirm questionable design choices"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":15345}

At least, if the latest rumors are any indication. \nWhile we've already heard that the phone, which will reportedly be called the Galaxy Z Flip, will have a clamshell design, we now know a bit more about how that folding screen will work. \nThe new details come from XDA Developers' Max Weinbach who reports the Z Flip will have the ability to \"lock\" at a 90-degree angle, which allows the bottom half of the phone to act as a kickstand. Apps, including the phone's camera, will be able to take advantage of this orientation, which sounds particularly useful for video calls or watching short videos. Weinbach also says the Flip will reprise another notable feature from the original flip phone era: ending phone calls by folding it closed. \nBasically, it locks into this position and more than just the camera will be supported pic.twitter.com/nmD8sraRx2— Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) January 22, 2020\n\nNotably, this is all a bit different than how Motorola's Razr works. Though that phone also has a clamshell design, its hinge can't \"lock\" in a 90-degree position. Instead, it uses a smaller, secondary screen you can use with some apps, like Google's Duo, when the phone is folded up. \nThe Z Flip, on the other hand, will use a single, reportedly 6.7-inch display that can adapt to two different orientations.\nOf course, these are all still unverified rumors for now, but the new details are in line with a concept the company previously teased at its developer conference last year. In the video, Samsung showed off how a phone with a clamshell design might be able to use a folding screen as the kind of kickstand Weinbach mentioned. \nThe new rumors come just weeks ahead of Samsung's Unpacked event. In addition to the rumored Galaxy Z Flip, the company is expected to show off its next lineup of 5G-ready flagship phones, the Galaxy S20. \nBut it's the Galaxy Z Flip that's a bigger question mark. After last year's bungled Galaxy Fold rollout, pressure will be intense for Samsung to show off a foldable phone that's actually ready for the spotlight. Which makes the little we know about Z Flip all the more intriguing. While the Galaxy Fold's design was thick and awkward — to say nothing of that crease — the Z Flip sounds like it could take advantage of its foldable screen in a way that actually makes sense. \nAnd by using a clamshell design, Samsung will not only get to take advantage of flip phone nostalgia, it makes the phone a lot easier to handle. Instead of a device that's awkwardly bulky and wide, you might actually be able to use it one-handed. \nEven so, there's still a ton we don't know, including the price or most of the specs. The good news is that we won't have much longer to wait: Unpacked is Feb. 11. Now, we just have to hope that there's no crease."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=0qEE07FeVJwLOe_eZMcSa4nSPUg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=pA7LNYgBSNhI3NLH22YKldSf8VY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F356x205.png?signature=KIDcmEGXn3komhYbIMD3JhkL3ok=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109662%252Fe8a3f78d-6098-469a-8f3a-0b5b24af8181.png%252F712x410.png?signature=xvYHnX7zOlYOs1d2M6OFN2p28HQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

They'll be the most advanced iPhones ever (because of course they'll be). \nWith new cameras (two on the iPhone 11 and three on the 11 Pro), they'll likely push photography and video recording to new heights.\nNothing wrong with better cameras, but if you're hoping for Apple to wow with iPhones that are, perhaps, more revolutionary instead of iterative, you'll probably have to wait until 2020.\nSEE ALSO: How to watch Apple's big iPhone event\nIf all the rumors and leaks ending up being correct — they're almost always right these days — the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be somewhat modest updates.\nFrom the front, the iPhone 11 should look like the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 Pros should resemble the iPhone XS and XS Max: same screen sizes, notches, and bezel thicknesses.\nThe cameras will likely be better, too: dual cameras on the iPhone 11 and triple cameras on the iPhone 11 Pros.\nInside, Apple is expected to improve performance with a new A13 chip and Ultra Wide Band wireless technology in an \"R1\" sensor for more precise location tracking (possibly related to the rumored Tile-like item tracker), more responsive Face ID unlock, and reverse wireless charging for juicing up AirPods and Apple Watch.\nAll of these features will no doubt be good additions to the iPhone, but will they drum up the same kind of mass hype that past iPhones used to? Probably not.\nNext year's iPhones, however, could be the real deal — the first major update to the iPhone since the iPhone X was released in 2017.\nIt's way too early to declare any rumored features for the iPhone 2020 are a lock. But considering the source, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, has a long history accurately predicting new features based on information from the supply chain, the rumors have more weight.\nSo what are we hearing? A lot, actually.\nRedesign: Apple last gave the iPhone a physical refresh with the iPhone X, ditching the rectangle display and home button for an edge-to-edge display with rounded corners and Face ID. For 2020, Kuo says Apple's cooking up an \"all-new form factor design.\" \nWhat that actually means is unclear. I, personally, would love a boxier industrial design with flat edges similar to the iPad Pro. I'd also like to see the camera bump become flush with the body again, too.\nRegardless, the iPhone X design will look super outdated by 2020. Hopefully, Apple has something dazzling up its sleeve.\nNew display sizes: Along with the design revamp, Kuo says Apple might introduce new display sizes. Currently, the iPhone lineup includes a 6.1-inch iPhone XR, 5.8-inch iPhone XS, and 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max.\nFor 2020, Kuo says Apple's gonna switch to a smaller 5.4-inch iPhone and larger 6.7-inch iPhone. No word on whether the 6.1-inch iPhone will also get shrunk or enlarged.\nNew screen sizes could appeal to people who miss smaller iPhones of yesteryear and people who want an almost tablet-like experience.\nIn-display Touch ID: The iPhone X killed Touch ID and replaced it with Face ID, but the fingerprint sensor might return inside the 2020 iPhone's display. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, another reliable source on Apple, says the 2020 iPhone will have an in-display Touch ID that'll be complementary to Face ID.\nGurman's report corroborates an earlier investor note from Kuo, who also predicts Apple will add an in-display Touch ID sensor.\nIf you dislike Face ID because it's slower than Touch ID, 2020's iPhone could bring the good ol' finger biometric.\n5G: Wireless carriers have started lighting up select cities with 5G and companies like Samsung and OnePlus already have 5G-enabled phones. The popularity of iPhones, however, will no doubt help usher in faster 5G networks in big ways. Who doesn't want gigabit download speeds that'll burn through your monthly data plan in seconds?\nUSB-C port: Apple switched to the reversible Lightning port in 2012 with the iPhone 5. Lightning did its job, but it's time to move on to USB-C, which is also reversible, and is capable of faster data output. \nApple's other devices like the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro and MacBook Air all switched to USB-C. With a redesign, when better than to switch to the unofficial universal port? \nHow to wait until 2020\nAs you can see, there's a lot to look forward to on the iPhone 2020 (assuming these features end up shaking out, of course).\nBut the wait until the fall of 2020, when Apple's likely to release these new iPhones, is a long one. How can you hold out until then?\nIf you own an iPhone and the battery no longer lasts as long anymore, consider getting the battery replaced or opt for a battery pack, like Apple's Smart Battery Case. \nUpdating your device to iOS 13 will also breathe new life into it with new features like Dark Mode and a revamped Photos app.\nWATCH: Apple’s iPhone 11 event coming Sept.

11\" and \"iPhone 11 Pro\") because the 2020 iPhones sound way more groundbreaking.\nAccording to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac), the 2020 iPhones will reportedly come with a major redesign. \nIn a new note to investors, Kuo says the coming year's iPhones will have \"an all-new form factor design\" as well as \"5G support\" and \"camera function upgrades.\"\nHe believes these three key upgrades will boost stagnating iPhone sales to new year-over-year growth.\nSEE ALSO: What to expect from Apple's 'iPhone 11' event on Sept. 10\nThough Kuo didn't share details on what an \"all-new form factor design\" could mean, we'd be down for an industrial design that's similar to latest iPad Pros, which sport corners, flat sides, and a camera bump that doesn't look completely terrible.\nThat said, it's difficult to imagine Apple returning to an aluminum design for the body. Apple switched to glass starting with the iPhone 8 and iPhone X to enable wireless charging. Metal, as we already know, doesn't play very nicely with wireless charging. And with Apple expected to add \"reverse wireless charging\" on this year's iPhone 11 Pro to charge up AirPods, it seems even more unlikely we'll get a metal iPhone in 2020.\nStill, a new form factor could mean many things. A smaller notch, in-display Touch ID, depth sensor on the rear for augmented reality, and USB-C port instead of Lightning are all features that are rumored for the 2020 iPhone. Apple is also expected to add 5G to next year's iPhones.\nKuo previously claimed the 2020 iPhones would come in new screen sizes: 5.4 inch and 6.7 inch, to replace the current 5.8 inch and 6.5 inch displays. A 6.1-inch iPhone (most likely a third-generation iPhone XR) will remain in the lineup as well.\nThis year's iPhone will be the third iteration of the iPhone X's design, which came out in 2017. Though revolutionary at the time, smartphone makers quickly caught up and surpassed the iPhone X with even bolder edge-to-edge designs without notches. \nPhones such as the OnePlus 7 Pro and Galaxy Note 10 have one-upped the iPhone with screens that boast higher screen-to-body ratios and other phones like Huawei's P30 Pro and the Google Pixel 3 have superior cameras, especially for low-light photography.\nAssuming these rumors come to fruition, the 2020 iPhone might be the device that reverses flat iPhone sales.\nWATCH: This edgeless concept iPhone is out of this world"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1044228%252F704de323-7035-4297-9a52-9edbff4099a2.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=qMDW-znY6yhxeow3ruQY0L20U7Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102590%252F04c51274-093b-4153-b171-2b6b8d851185.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=ipA9lC653XFV29qZLzIX_4bXjnw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102590%252F04c51274-093b-4153-b171-2b6b8d851185.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=CMxRXoIIVBadEyNMRWWiqsefusg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102590%252F04c51274-093b-4153-b171-2b6b8d851185.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=OQfIB7CpKo4Fm1eFIRMkD-BOOJ4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102590%252F04c51274-093b-4153-b171-2b6b8d851185.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=VXAKY3ZeQeC0JMKQzGv9ER3HYmw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102590%252F04c51274-093b-4153-b171-2b6b8d851185.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=8MrjXLcOmp8dqU-Go8634Bs7REw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"iPhone 2020 might finally have an all-new design","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102590%252F04c51274-093b-4153-b171-2b6b8d851185.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=CMxRXoIIVBadEyNMRWWiqsefusg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102590%252F04c51274-093b-4153-b171-2b6b8d851185.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=VXAKY3ZeQeC0JMKQzGv9ER3HYmw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102590%252F04c51274-093b-4153-b171-2b6b8d851185.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=CMxRXoIIVBadEyNMRWWiqsefusg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"iPhone 2020 might finally have an all-new design","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"BdoM283G09","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Goodbye notch?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"iPhone 2020 might finally have an all-new design"},{"_id":"5d67e96a2463a3728100003c","id":"/article/huawei-mate-30-screwed-no-google-services/","title":"Huawei's Mate 30 is so screwed without Google services","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2019-08-29T15:04:07+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 15:04:07 +0000","formatted_date":"08/29/2019","sort_key":"1I3tA5","link":"https://mashable.com/article/huawei-mate-30-screwed-no-google-services/","content":{"plain":"Huawei's next flagship Android smartphone, the Mate 30, will ship with a major disadvantage when it launches on Sept. 18.\nDue to the ongoing ban on U.S. companies working with Huawei, the company's upcoming Mate 30 will not ship with Google Play, which means users will not be able to access services like the Google Play app store, Gmail, or Google Maps, according to Reuters.\nIn the U.S. and Europe, Google Play services are deemed essential to Android devices. Without Google services, smartphones are basically \"useless\" insists my colleague Stan Schroeder, who's reviewed Huawei phones without them.\nSEE ALSO: Huawei's foldable Mate X reportedly faces another delay\nIn China, though, the Mate 30 won't be as crippled since Google and its services are banned, and Chinese alternatives such as Baidu and Youku exist to replace them.\nAccording to Reuters, the Mate 30 will still ship with Android — the operating system is open source and free for any company to use and modify — but the lack of the Play Store and Google's services could seriously impact Huawei's phone sales in the west.\nThe Mate 30 could take a serious beating particularly in Europe, where Huawei previously saw a 60% increase in phone sales from 2017-2018, but watched as sales plummeted 40% a month after the U.S. blacklisted the company and banned American companies from working with it.\nFor Huawei, the Mate 30 will be a test of not just its technology, but its brand. Can the Chinese company's phones still be successful without Google? Sure, it can in China, where it's the No. 1 smartphone maker. But in the west, where Google's services are core to the Android platform, Huawei doesn't stand much of a chance.\nThere's no doubt the the Mate 30 (and its Mate 30 Pro variant) will be an impressive smartphone — rumors already suggest it'll be packed from top to bottom with seemingly every feature imaginable — but great hardware alone isn't enough anymore. Without essential services, a new phone is just a  pretty metal-and-glass slab.\nHuawei's best bet for the future is to reduce its reliance on Google services and American companies so that it can't be used as a bargaining chip in any trade wars. \nThe company's developing its own \"Harmony OS,\" but it's a long way off from being ready for smartphones. The biggest challenge will be getting third-party developers to port their apps to another platform.\nWe'll see if Huawei's Mate 30 will sink or swim, but it's not looking good so far.\nWATCH: The Huawei Mate X Is the Coolest Folding Phone We’ve Seen Yet"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1040112%252Fcea77ffd-a3dc-4e9d-abd6-5a839156ae15.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=zBPfvhhuSQ6W8vadYEi1qwyZ6-U=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102065%252F64a2b3be-4865-4366-bf18-77f434537018.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=Nsv75O1HwUEYbIS3R4VZu1M4izk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102065%252F64a2b3be-4865-4366-bf18-77f434537018.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=sMGa_sBneYgjT_8kHE21xihsJTM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102065%252F64a2b3be-4865-4366-bf18-77f434537018.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=L0CTNwhe5i1wlG9P--BoCEeqfnI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102065%252F64a2b3be-4865-4366-bf18-77f434537018.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=X0tf4t0k-RkJMiBXleT-ujLk4WM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102065%252F64a2b3be-4865-4366-bf18-77f434537018.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=tygVrtJpsD4CslzxTPMaaZnaZxA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Huawei's Mate 30 is so screwed without Google services","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102065%252F64a2b3be-4865-4366-bf18-77f434537018.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=sMGa_sBneYgjT_8kHE21xihsJTM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102065%252F64a2b3be-4865-4366-bf18-77f434537018.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=X0tf4t0k-RkJMiBXleT-ujLk4WM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F102065%252F64a2b3be-4865-4366-bf18-77f434537018.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=sMGa_sBneYgjT_8kHE21xihsJTM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Huawei's Mate 30 is so screwed without Google services","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"YxlJkAQDo9","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Without Google, the phone's just another shiny metal and glass slab.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Huawei's Mate 30 is so screwed without Google services"},{"_id":"5d6697202463a3402a00004a","id":"/article/google-pixel-4-leak-sprint-dual-cameras-soli/","title":"Leaked Google Pixel 4 photos confirm questionable design choices","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2019-08-28T15:00:44+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 15:00:44 +0000","formatted_date":"08/28/2019","sort_key":"1I3jbz","link":"https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-4-leak-sprint-dual-cameras-soli/","content":{"plain":"Google's not even trying to hide the Pixel 4 anymore.\nFollowing a summer of teasing images and pre-announcing new features for the Pixel 4, which is expected to launch in October, alleged photos of the Android phone in the wild have now surfaced.\nAccording to XDA-Developers, the two photos of the Pixel 4 were reportedly shared via their Telegram group and seemingly confirm what we already know about the device: it'll have a bezel above the screen for a shrunken version of Google's Soli radar sensor and a large-ish square-shaped bump on the rear that houses two cameras.\nThe Google Pixel 4 may have just leaked yet again - Check out these new images! https://t.co/XXRmEI8Kig pic.twitter.com/X12tiZwgfE— XDA Developers (@xdadevelopers) August 28, 2019\n\nThe images of the alleged new model also suggest the Pixel 4's being tested on Sprint (but don't expect it to support 5G), won't come with the Pixel's signature two-tone rear design, and the black version might come with a white shaded power button.\nThe Pixel 4's expected to be Google's most notable premium Pixel release yet. Rumors suggest the rear bump will house two cameras -- a main camera and a telephoto camera -- and, possibly, a spectral sensor similar to the Pixel 3. \nThe fingerprint reader on the back is also going to be replaced by a Face ID-like face unlock feature. Google announced in July the Pixel 4's face unlock works in almost any orientation and uses a Soli radar sensor to detect when you're near the phone and then unlocks \"in one motion.\"\nThe Soli radar sensor also has another trick: hand gestures. Called \"Motion Sense,\" you'll be able to wave your hand in front of the Pixel 4 to do things like \"skip songs, snooze alarms, and silence phone calls.\" \nSEE ALSO: Own Google's first Pixel or Pixel XL? You could claim up to $500.\nAnd that's about all we know about the Pixel 4 so far. If Google follows previous releases, the phone will come in two sizes and likely come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855, Android 10, hopefully more RAM (the Pixel 3's performance has tanked with new updates because it has so little RAM), and larger batteries.\nIn previous years, Google released the original Pixel on Oct. 20, 2016; the Pixel 2 on Oct. 19, 2017; and Pixel 3 on Oct. 18, 2018. Unless Google bucks tradition, expect the Pixel 4 to launch in late October 2019.\nWATCH: Does the Google Pixel 3 have the best smartphone camera? — Mashable

out until Aug. 23, but we have the bigger phone — literally in our hands — in the enchanting Aura Glow color, and within seconds of unboxing it we can already definitively tell you there's gonna be a learning curve.\nIt's not the removal of the headphone jack or the S-Pen's new air gesture controls that's bothering us, but the power button. It's moved from the usual right side of the phone to the left, below the volume rocker.\nAs a righty, I instinctively reached for the power button on the right side of the Note 10+ as I have on my iPhone XS and Android phones for years, only to realize there's nothing there. \nLearning to press the power button with my left hand is going to take some retraining of my muscle memory.\nFor lefties, though: This. Is. Your. Moment! \nSEE ALSO: Why Samsung removed the headphone jack from the Galaxy Note 10\nFinally, a flagship Samsung phone that doesn't make lefties feel like second-class citizens. On the Note 10 and Note 10+, lefties can now easily and comfortably press the power button as we righties have been able to do for years. No more awkwardly reaching over with your index finger anymore.\nThe power button's relocation from the right side to the left side also comes with two other important changes: turning the device off and activating Bixby. \nSince none of the Note 10 phones come with a physical Bixby button, Samsung's now mapped the digital assistant to the power button via a long press. Here's how the power button works on the Note 10 and Note 10+:\n\n  Single press: Unlock the phone.\n  Double press: Open the camera app.\n  Long press: Activate Bixby.\n\nBut if a long press on the power button activates Bixby, how do you turn the phone off or restart it?\nTo bring up these settings, which are accessed with a long press on the power button on other Samsung phones, you drag down the quick settings menu from the top and tap the new power button in the upper right corner, next to the shortcut to the settings app:\n\nYou can also bring up the power off menu by pressing the power button and volume down button at the same time.\nFortunately, that's just the default setting and you can change the long press from activating Bixby to displaying the power off menu.\nTo do that, go to Settings > Advanced features > Side key and then under \"Press and hold\" change the setting from \"Wake Bixby\" to \"Power off menu\" and you're good to go.\nLike I said, if you get a Note 10 or Note 10+, there's going to be an initial learning curve if you're a righty. Unlearning old habits and building new ones is hard, but you basically have no choice. However, if you're a lefty, the power button change is basically perfect.\nWe'll have a full review of the Note 10's with in-depth performance, camera comparisons, and more soon, but for now, if you're a lefty, go ahead and pump your fists!

jack.\nAfter three years of bashing Apple for removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack from the iPhone, Samsung has joined its rival and killed the audio port from its new Galaxy Note 10 phones, too.\nYep, the jack is gone from Samsung's biggest and most powerful phone of the year, and it's likely never returning in any future Galaxy Notes.\nBut why is Samsung eliminating the analog audio port after holding out for so long? \nSEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is a hot alternative to the Apple Watch\nThe answer may be obvious to engineers and designers: The jack had to go in order to make room for other components. \nSpecifically, Samsung needed more space to cram larger batteries into both the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+.\nSamsung's director of product strategy and marketing Suzanne De Silva told me ahead of the Note 10s' Unpacked launch event that because the two Note 10s are so thin, they needed more space along the vertical y-axis to spread out the battery cells.\nSamsung could have crammed in larger batteries that are thicker, but that would have also meant making the Note 10s fatter as well.\nBy gutting the headphone jack and making the batteries thinner and taller, Samsung was able to safely fit them inside the phones' thin bodies. \n\nIf you recall, the reason why Note 7 phones exploded in 2016 was because the batteries barely fit into their thin bodies. Samsung tried to cram every imaginable phone feature in the Note 7 and paid the price. With the Note 10, Samsung's not taking any chances. A big and safe battery comes at the expense of the headphone jack. Don't like it? Get a Galaxy S10 or Pixel 3a or 3a XL instead.\nAnd thin as the Note 10 batteries are, Samsung says they go through the same 8-point battery safety check as all of its batteries have since the Note 7 disaster.\nThere's also another reason Samsung removed the headphone jack: According to the company's post-purchase research, the majority of Galaxy Note users are using wireless headphones or earbuds with their phones.\nWhether they're using Samsung's own IconX or Galaxy Buds or another brand's wireless headphones, De Silva said Note users are early adopters of new technologies and have embraced a wire-free listening experience.\nMy own unscientific polling on Twitter also suggests people aren't as bothered by the death of the jack. Maybe it's because other phones, like the Pixel 3 and OnePlus 7 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro, don't have headphone jacks, either. Or maybe because everyone's got wireless earbuds. Whatever the case, the loss of the port is no longer as unreasonable as it was a few years ago.\nIt’s Galaxy Note 10 day. Y’all upset about the headphone jack going bye bye?— Raymond Wong📱💾📼 (@raywongy) August 7, 2019\n\nSo, there you go. Samsung isn't killing the headphone jack because of \"courage.\" The jack's dead for the sake of a bigger battery and wireless headphones. It sure isn't an exciting answer, but at least now you can sleep easy knowing why.\nAs for whether this means next year's Galaxy S11 won't have a headphone jack, Samsung and De Silva wouldn't say, but it's probably a safe bet it won't. After all, the Galaxy Fold, which is relaunching in September, doesn't have a headphone jack, either.\nThe future — for phones at least — is headphone jack-less. You can choose to resist it all you want, but just like they did with removable batteries, flagship phones will inevitably drop the jack.\nWATCH: Hands-on with Galaxy Note 10"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1027250%252Fc1f254a2-e052-4948-8ec4-25d03fd32acd.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=BKiqD6F3RQPwiiWxFA3LfXsmSKE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100697%252F250a9338-d94d-4cb9-9bd2-d352c7369542.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=OrlO7INZpWx2D7GaAa7Z-Ed6KO8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100697%252F250a9338-d94d-4cb9-9bd2-d352c7369542.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=K9QtaxELryj5s0zxyk3m8Of5b1w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100697%252F250a9338-d94d-4cb9-9bd2-d352c7369542.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=x7zo9v0bK6tHaM24cTWtUagQKHo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100697%252F250a9338-d94d-4cb9-9bd2-d352c7369542.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=aocN2_g8lOWCLOeFbw6si_Q_3Fs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100697%252F250a9338-d94d-4cb9-9bd2-d352c7369542.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=dm6g3Ly7uuQ10UxPgrvxaJYaPMQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Why Samsung removed the headphone jack from the Galaxy Note 10","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100697%252F250a9338-d94d-4cb9-9bd2-d352c7369542.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=K9QtaxELryj5s0zxyk3m8Of5b1w=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100697%252F250a9338-d94d-4cb9-9bd2-d352c7369542.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=aocN2_g8lOWCLOeFbw6si_Q_3Fs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F100697%252F250a9338-d94d-4cb9-9bd2-d352c7369542.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=K9QtaxELryj5s0zxyk3m8Of5b1w=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Why Samsung removed the headphone jack from the Galaxy Note 10","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"360Oeq7XlV","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It's not because of \"courage,\" that's for sure.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Why Samsung removed the headphone jack from the Galaxy Note 10"},{"_id":"5d4b2e30ca2f0c342d00001d","id":"/article/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-hands-on/","title":"Samsung's Galaxy Note 10 pushes all-screen phones to their limits","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2019-08-07T20:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 07 Aug 2019 20:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"08/07/2019","sort_key":"1HVunv","link":"https://mashable.com/article/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-hands-on/","content":{"plain":"The wait is over. Samsung's Galaxy Note 10 is official and, no, it doesn't have a headphone jack.\nBut before I get to why Samsung killed the classic audio port on the Note 10, I'd like to clarify that the new phone isn't a single device, but two: a 6.3-inch Note 10 and 6.8-inch Note 10+.\nSamsung's always billed the Galaxy Note as its biggest and most cutting edge smartphone — a device for power users built with productivity in mind — and the two Note 10s are no different.\nThe new Android phones don't break new ground with anything like a foldable display or camera embedded underneath the screen, but when it comes to tried-and-true innovation upgrades, there's really little to dislike (except maybe the whole headphone jack removal, of course).\nSEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is a hot alternative to the Apple Watch\nLike previous Galaxy Notes, the Note 10 and Note 10+ will cost a pretty penny when they launch on Aug. 23: $949 for the Note 10 with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, $1,099 for the Note 10+ with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM, and $1,199 for the Note 10+ with 512GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. \nPre-orders start on Aug. 8 at 12:01 a.m. ET.\nVerizon will exclusively sell a 5G version of the Note 10+ (there's no 5G version of the regular Note 10 in the U.S., only in South Korea) for a limited time; it'll launch on Aug. 23 and cost $1,299.99 for the 256GB model (there's no 512GB 5G model).\nAT&T says it'll carry the Note 10+ 5G \"by the end of the year.\" Sprint says it'll get get the Note 10+ \"at a later date\" and T-Mobile announced its own launch \"in Q4 this year.\"\nAs you can see, they're pricey phones. That said, you still get a lot for your money. \nBeautiful glass slabs\n\nSamsung says the Note 10 and Note 10+ are its thinnest and lightest Galaxy Notes ever. Holding a Galaxy Note 9 in one hand and a Note 10+ in the other, I could immediately feel the difference.\nIn true Samsung fashion, the glass display curves at the edges and bleeds into the polished aluminum frame. This time around, the front and back glass merge into the metal frame more seamlessly and the top and bottom of the phone have been flattened out.\nIt’s a clean and symmetrical look, and the phones feel good in the hand. You're literally holding glass slabs. The Note 10 is roughly the same width of an iPhone XS and maybe half an inch taller. On the other hand, the Note 10+ is about the same dimensions as the Note 9. Needless to say, the smaller Note 10 is way more pocketable.\nDominating each of the phones' fronts is a Dynamic AMOLED screen. The Note 10's 6.3-inch screen has a resolution of 2,280 x 1,080 at 401 pixels per inch and the Note 10+ has a resolution of 3,040 x 1,440 resolution at 498 pixels per inch. \n\nThese screens are easily as spectacular as the displays in the Galaxy S10's; they support HDR10+ and are very bright, sharp, and vibrant. But of course the Note 10's screens are superb — they're Samsung screens, after all. \nThere’s just a single round cutout for a 10-megapixel selfie camera at the top of the display. Samsung calls this an \"Infinity-O\" display. Personally, I think it looks better than any notch or hole-punch off to the side.\nUnderneath the screen is also the same ultrasonic fingerprint reader first introduced on the Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10 5G.\nOne thing you'll notice has moved is the the power button. It's now on the left side below the volume rocker. It's a weird relocation — great for lefties to press with their thumbs, but sucks for righties — and will take some getting used to. And the hated Bixby button? It's finally no more on both Note 10's! \n\nThe phones come in a variety of colors, including Aura White, Aura Black, and Aura Blue. The latter will be exclusive to the Note 10+ in the U.S. and sold at Best Buy.\nBut in my opinion, the prettiest Note 10 is easily Aura Glow, which has an iridescent finish and shifts between different colors depending on how light hits it. It's just unlike any other phone I've ever seen.\n\nHowever, as stunning as the Note 10s are, they're missing one thing: the 3.5mm headphone jack. After years of making fun of Apple for removing it, Samsung's now gone and killed the audio port, too.\nApple said the port simply needed to go because it believes the future is wireless. OnePlus said it killed the jack on its phones because it needed room for an in-display fingerprint sensor. \n\nSo what's Samsung's reason? They gave me two answers. One, they needed room for larger capacity batteries that would fit the slimmer designs. And two, Note users have largely adopted Bluetooth headphones, so now's the right time to drop the jack.\nSatisfying or not, I personally am fine with the lack of a headphone jack. iPhones, Pixels, and OnePlus phones don't have them, so there's no real reason for them here, either. Interestingly, Samsung's including a pair of AKG wired USB-C earbuds in the Note 10 box, but no dongle. \nNot to worry, though. We ranked the best headphone jack dongles. You've got plenty to choose from.\nAll the performance\n\nIf there's anything the Note 10 and Note 10+ are not lacking, it's power. They're Samsung's latest phones and you better believe they're packing all the performance.\nInside, both phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 chip. Compared to the Note 9, the Note 10 has up to 33 percent faster CPU performance and up to 42 percent more powerful graphics performance. \nI can only speak for the pre-production Note 10 and Note 10+ devices I tried, but from what I could tell, they're super fast.\nLike the Galaxy S10s, the Note 10’s run Android 9 Pie with Samsung’s One UI skin. It's no stock Android, but it's at least super smooth and responsive.\n\nOther ways the Note 10 is speedy: wireless connectivity. The Note 10 and Note 10+ boast ultra-fast LTE with up to 2Gbps download speeds and also support the new WiFi 6 protocol.\nIf you want 5G, it’ll only be sold as a special Note 10+ version. There’s no 5G for the smaller Note 10.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Note 10 comes in one configuration model with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Meanwhile, the Note 10+ has either 256GB or 512GB of storage with 12GB of RAM. MicroSD storage expansion is also limited to the Note 10+.\nBattery life should also be solid on the Note 10's. The Note 10 has a 3,500 mAh battery and the Note 10+ has a 4,300 mAh battery. With the included 25-watt fast charger, Samsung says the phones can be juiced up from 0-100 percent in a little over an hour and with a 45-watt charger (sold separately), the phones can get enough power to \"last through the day\" with a 30-minute charge.\n\nPerformance also comes in the form of the cameras. Both Note 10's come with a bunch of them on the back.\nOn the rear, the Note 10 and 10+ share mostly the same triple-camera system. There’s a 12-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel telephoto camera, and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera. These should produce photos similar to shots from the Galaxy S10 and 10+.\n\nThe only difference is that the Note 10+ has a fourth \"Time of Flight\" camera. There aren’t many uses for this small 3D depth camera yet, but Samsung says it’ll be useful for AR. For example, with a special app, you can 3D scan an object into the digital world and \"place\" it the real world using AR.\nSamsung's also added a few new video recording features. There's a \"Zoom-In Mic\" that lets record audio from a specific source within the video. For example, say there are three people in a video — with Zoom-In Mic you can amplify one person's voice and reduce the others by zooming in on them. The Note 10's cameras also feature improved video stabilization for smoother, less shaky footage.\nBy far the most fun new camera feature is \"Live Focus Video.\" You can think of it like portrait mode, but for video. With Live Focus Video, you can blur out the background and apply different background filters in real time to make videos more interesting.\n\nThere are several Live Focus Video filters to mess with. Color point is my favorite. It looks for faces and then keeps a person in color while the background is turned to black and white. The glitch filter is also fun and gives your footage an old-school cassette tape-like vibe.\nOh, and I don't wanna forget the new built-in video editor inside of the Gallery app. It's not quite as advanced as iMovie on the iPhone, but still very easy to use. Within seconds I was was editing clips together with the precision of the S Pen. Advanced users will also appreciate that Samsung's worked with Adobe to optimize Premiere Rush to take advantage of the Note 10's performance.\nSnoozy new S Pen features\n\nOf course, if you're considering the Note 10 or Note 10+, you'll likely be wondering about new S Pen features. \nUnfortunately, the S Pen is light on splashy new S Pen features. The two main ones are handwriting-to-text conversion and AR Doodle.\nConverting handwriting to text has existed on Galaxy Notes before, but Samsung says it’s now using machine learning to detect and convert 62 different languages. In my brief tests on a pre-production Note 10, the conversions were hit or miss. The software nailed some of my chicken scratch, but failed to correctly convert others.\n\nOn the bright side, the Note 10 lets you export converted handwriting-to-text notes directly as Microsoft Word, PDF, text, and image files. You know, if you've been waiting on this feature.\n\nAR Doodle on the other hand is mostly a fun feature. Using the S Pen, you can draw on your face and have the doodles move with you. It’s so silly, yet strangely entertaining. \nOne Note no longer fits all\n\nWith two models, the question is: which Note 10 do you get? Should you buy the small one or get the big one?\nSamsung says it made two sizes to offer choice. If you already own a previous Note and still want the biggest screen and largest battery, you’ll probably gravitate towards the Note 10+. \nBut if you’re new to the Galaxy Note, want the S Pen, but still want a smaller phone, the Note 10 will likely be the way to go.\nEither way, both Note 10s are top-notch phones. Samsung is playing it safe, but is there a need for more?
