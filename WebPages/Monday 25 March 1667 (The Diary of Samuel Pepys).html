        <h1> Monday 25 March 1667 </h1> 
        <p>(Ladyday.) Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/103/">Exeter House</a> to our lawyers to have consulted about our trial to-morrow, but missed them, so parted, and [Sir] W. Pen and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy’s</a> about a little business of [Sir] W. Pen’s, where we went over Mr. Povy’s house, which lies in the same good condition as ever, which is most extraordinary fine, and he was now at work with a cabinet-maker, making of a new inlaid table. Having seen his house, we away, having in our way thither called at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1488/">Mr. Lilly’s</a>, who was working; and indeed his pictures are without doubt much beyond <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Mr. Hales’s</a>, I think I may say I am convinced: but a mighty proud man he is, and full of state. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and by and by to dinner, a poor dinner, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I, at Sir W. Pen’s, and then he and I before to Exeter House, where I do not stay, but to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/475/">King’s playhouse</a>; and by and by comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2850/">Mr. Lowther</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2849/">his wife</a> and mine, and into a box, forsooth, neither of them being dressed, which I was almost ashamed of. Sir W. Pen and I in the pit, and here saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10905/">“The Mayden Queene”</a> again; which indeed the more I see the more I like, and is an excellent play, and so done by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5037/">Nell</a>, her merry part, as cannot be better done in nature, I think. Thence home, and there I find letters from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a>, which tell me that yesterday when he wrote <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a> did rattle in the throat so as they did expect every moment her death, which though I have a good while expected did much surprise me, yet was obliged to sup at Sir W. Pen’s and my wife, and there counterfeited some little mirth, but my heart was sad, and so home after supper and to bed, and much troubled in my sleep of my being crying by my mother’s bedside, laying my head over hers and crying, she almost dead and dying, and so waked, but what is strange, methought she had hair over her face, and not the same kind of face as my mother really hath, but yet did not consider that, but did weep over her as my mother, whose soul God have mercy of.</p>

         <p>Peter Lely is THE painter of the time, the official portraitist to the King, and he and his studio of assistants are busily churning out pictures of the royal family, peers,and other grandees by the score; he's in such demand that his portrait sittings began at eight a.m. The last thing Lely likely wished was to be interrupted at his easel by chatty Sam, determined to have a bit of art appreciation. Probably accounts for Sam's huffy estimation of Mr. Lely as "mighty proud."</p>

         <p>Hi, Cum grano salis, I know you meant "threat" but in Ireland dutch treat means that you are invited out for dinner and then have to pay for it yourself. Perhaps it was a freudian slip.</p>

         <p>Well, there is that little matter of the trial over the prize-goods, with the court sitting tomorrow. Sam apparently has no hope (that death-rattle, reported as having been heard yesterday) of getting to Brampton before his mother draws her last breath.</p>

         <p>“and much troubled in my sleep of my being crying by my mother’s bedside, laying my head over hers and crying, she almost dead and dying, and so waked, but what is strange, methought she had hair over her face, and not the same kind of face as my mother really hath, but yet did not consider that, but did weep over her as my mother, whose soul God have mercy of.”</p> 
         <p>I feel very badly for Sam, not because he is dreaming of his mother dying, but because he isn’t with her while she is dying. There is nothing as difficult as being with someone you love as they pass on, but being beside that person to comfort them through their final moments, as wrenching as those moments may be, can be the ultimate expression of devoted love, and in the long term, a comfort to the survivor. <br></p>

         <p>We normally see Sam as a man of action - dashing about in boats and coaches, writing long epistles, poking about in the dockyards to check up on things. Eager for Court gossip, visiting friends and so on. His strange inaction at this bitter news seems out of character. As has been suggested, surely he could send money - or even Bess to Brampton. A passive Sam is odd.</p>

         <p>"In Annunciation Style dating the new year started on 25 March, the feast of the Annunciation. This was used in many parts of Europe in the Middle Ages. Annunciation Style continued to be used officially in the Kingdom of Great Britain until 1 January 1752, except Scotland which changed to Circumcision Style dating on 1 January 1600, the Act being passed on 17 December 1599.[17] The rest of Great Britain changed to Circumcision Style on the 1 January preceding the conversion in Great Britain from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar on 3/14 September 1752. The UK tax year still starts on 6 April which is 25 March + 12 days, eleven for the conversion from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar plus a dropped leap day in 1900." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year#Historical_Christian_new_year_dates" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year#Historical_…</a></p>
