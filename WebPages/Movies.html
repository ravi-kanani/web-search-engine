The social distancing and self-quarantine has many holed up at home, catching up on films they skipped at the cinema in a desperate attempt to keep themselves and their families non-homicidal.\nSo of course, it was inevitable that popularly skipped cinematic curiosity Cats slunk its way back into our collective nightmare. (Or more specifically, slunk onto VOD earlier than scheduled.)\nAmong those experiencing the spectacle for the first time is actor Seth Rogen, who got high and watched Cats on Tuesday night. To be fair, it has been widely accepted that one of the best ways to watch Cats is under the influence. \nHowever, judging by Rogen's string of baffled tweets, being stoned doesn't appear to help the film about dancing humanoid felines make any more sense.\nAlso the scale is bizarre. The behind the scenes features, which are amazing, said the set is 2.5 times scale but that would mean cats are like  60 pounds in real life!— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 18, 2020\n\n\"I'm pretty stoned and watching Cats,\" Rogen tweeted at the outset of his journey through the cultural phenomenon. \"I've never seen the Broadway show.

We've already exhausted our Netflix queue and we're in need of something new to watch. \nRight now, Vudu has a bunch of movies on sale for half off. You'll find movies that aren't available on Netflix or Hulu that you can rent for pretty cheap, with prices ranging from $0.99 to $2.99.\nThe movies included in this sale range from beloved classics like Goodfellas and The Hunger Games to some newer releases like The Peanut Butter Falcon and Judy. You'll likely find me watching (read: sobbing at) La La Land later on tonight.\nIf none of the half-off movies are satisfying your movie cravings, Vudu offers tons of other films at higher costs. The service even has early access to films like Little Women, 1917, and Cats.

Other studios have opted to move up films' digital releases, but no one has canceled a theatrical debut altogether in favor of a digital one.\nFor a full list of movie releases delayed by coronavirus, click here."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1249539%252Fbdc62993-1bb5-4826-ab13-f7467955de7b.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=AeW6_CWq5yqGedq6-xHWUuSTc5k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112139%252Fb49de83e-57c3-42db-8fb0-514f11cfdfd7.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=WwBc-_Cg27DdUzDXhbWR-NskraU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112139%252Fb49de83e-57c3-42db-8fb0-514f11cfdfd7.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=2kVYQ6FaGBuxUYYY9F15VT5P4qw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112139%252Fb49de83e-57c3-42db-8fb0-514f11cfdfd7.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=eXdXrFgNMRUnBgHzliZosE4wtTU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Disney pulls 'Black Widow' release as coronavirus shutters movie theaters","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112139%252Fb49de83e-57c3-42db-8fb0-514f11cfdfd7.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=2kVYQ6FaGBuxUYYY9F15VT5P4qw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112139%252Fb49de83e-57c3-42db-8fb0-514f11cfdfd7.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=-zl9CwuzGKVjJaV8JayLIWvXTfo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112139%252Fb49de83e-57c3-42db-8fb0-514f11cfdfd7.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=2kVYQ6FaGBuxUYYY9F15VT5P4qw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Disney pulls 'Black Widow' release as coronavirus shutters movie theaters","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Fans will have to keep waiting to see Natasha Romanoff fly solo.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"Disney pulls 'Black Widow' release as coronavirus shutters movie theaters"}]

And sure, that loss is mitigated somewhat by the fact that you can access literally thousands of movies at your fingertips via iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and what have you. If all you want is to see something, you have no shortage of options.\nWhat's missing during this time of social distancing, though, is the communal aspect of the theatergoing experience — the excuse to meet up with friends, the energy of an enthralled crowd, the lively conversations that follow. And if that last sentence made you feel a pang of regret, we have a suggestion for you.\nBuy Cats. Convince your friends to do the same. Then log into a Google Hangout, and watch this thing together. Feel free to bring along any whiskey or edibles you may have stocked up on ahead of time.\nCats, out on VOD today (Tuesday), is the ideal pick for a virtual movie night not in spite of its terrible reputation (personally, I adored it) but because of it. It's got a notoriety that, admit it, has you intrigued to see just how disastrous it could possibly be.\n\nGive into your curiosity, and you'll find a movie that offers no end of things to gasp or giggle or what-the-hell-did-I-just-see to your friends about. Trust me, a person who's seen Cats four times in theaters, when I say that Rebel Wilson unzipping her cat skin suit to reveal another cat skin suit underneath is exactly the kind of hallucinatory vision you'll want to turn to someone and yell about afterward.\nSEE ALSO: The movies we're watching on repeat while stuck at home\nAnd once you're done collectively hyperventilating over that, or over James Corden gorging on enormous piles of garbage, or the utterly unsettling sight of the Idris Elba cat going fully naked, you can go right back to enjoying the movie, because it's not like there's a plot for you to lose track of.\nCats is the right jellicle choice.\nThe road to the Heaviside Layer (you'll understand when you see the movie, or maybe you won't) is filled with musical numbers to get your toes tapping, encourage impromptu singalongs, and maybe soundtrack your next hand-washing session. The story raises enough questions to provoke hours of debate, from big existential ones like \"where are all the humans?\" to nitpicky ones like \"why is the fork in Mister Mistoffelees' sleeve so tiny?\"\nYou can even toss in a drinking game for good measure, once you're got its rhythms down: Take a sip every time a cat hisses, or Macavity disappears, or anyone says \"jellicle.\" (On second thought, don't do that last one. You'll be dead of alcohol poisoning before Jennifer Hudson shows up.)\nCats may not have made a ton of money at the box office, but its sheer strangeness seems to have fated it for a new life as a cult hit, a la The Rocky Horror Picture Show or The Room — and like those movies, it has a mysterious but potent ability to unite a crowd. \nAnd while it may not be a good idea for Cats to literally bring people together right now, we suspect it'll cast a similar spell over broadband. If what you need after days alone in your room is to spend a couple of hours in a fantasy land with your friends, Cats is the right jellicle choice."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1247965%252F9fc263af-32b8-495c-a6c4-b248d372d8e8.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=XbVMW8tkTqxZSD0nXTkpeLRozL0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112095%252F31cd3f19-e460-45dd-8a9f-9d80e753d94f.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=WVKo60LfK8Bhx_gbJk0apeZgQOw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112095%252F31cd3f19-e460-45dd-8a9f-9d80e753d94f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=6mETH2QYjxYw_aQWkUk2q5bhSBs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112095%252F31cd3f19-e460-45dd-8a9f-9d80e753d94f.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=mG6erTAHJmlRO-fYtg1T-dN14rI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

gets right to the point: This movie is an idea about what happens after you die and before you're born. And of course it's really cute.\nSoul follows what happens to jazz musician Joe Gardner after he dies on what was one of the best days of his life. Not wanting to move onto the Great Beyond, Joe's soul leaps out of line and ends up in the Great Before, the place where souls are prepared before life. Despite these heavy themes, it looks like a really upbeat and optimistic view of life and the inevitability of death.\nSoul comes to theaters on June 19.Inside a Verily coronavirus testing site: How it works, from screening to diagnosisJoe Biden joins Jimmy Kimmel to talk cooking, coronavirus, and calling out TrumpThe Bon Appétit YouTube stars reveal how they're working from homeJimmy Fallon's at-home monologue gets hilariously heckled by his adorable kids"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=buch-F-jSfeF9Uuuw5CfUajkWlE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=Pm6xjDm7yk1JP62DC_R_x-HhITw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.png%252F356x205.png?signature=MvpEaUS_3Wiguxc_a4aYBkDLbOo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.png%252F712x410.png?signature=nQtocE1_ZIhKK74cRJkfkp2IVzI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.png%252F280x157.png?signature=-XBsJY_nLZk81QFC9DouU22ovyw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.png%252F560x314.png?signature=vNPuOhi-DWQF3WrifdO00l01F8A=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Pixar's 'Soul' trailer is an unbelievably sweet look at death","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.png%252F356x205.png?signature=MvpEaUS_3Wiguxc_a4aYBkDLbOo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=u4ycDYZ9TQ97lOixnnfqJ2BZWDA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=tEEguy8kHWzdQAswqXZ0yox1D5Q=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.png%252F280x157.png?signature=-XBsJY_nLZk81QFC9DouU22ovyw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111896%252F9748e0a4-dd3f-46bc-8958-d1fe0487f346.png%252F356x205.png?signature=MvpEaUS_3Wiguxc_a4aYBkDLbOo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Pixar's 'Soul' trailer is an unbelievably sweet look at death","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Coming June 19.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"Pixar's 'Soul' trailer is an unbelievably sweet look at death"},{"_id":"5e67d5b0f11b2c52e0000010","id":"/video/disney-jungle-cruise-trailer-watch/","title":"Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson team up for adventure in lighthearted 'Jungle Cruise' trailer","title_tag":null,"author":"Proma Khosla","post_date":"2020-03-10T18:00:15+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 18:00:15 +0000","formatted_date":"03/10/2020","sort_key":"1Jc2Cl","link":"https://mashable.com/video/disney-jungle-cruise-trailer-watch/","content":{"plain":"Dwayne Johnson is heading back to the jungle — not for another Jumanji sequel (not yet, anyway), but for Disney's Jungle Cruise.

The social distancing and self-quarantine has many holed up at home, catching up on films they skipped at the cinema in a desperate attempt to keep themselves and their families non-homicidal.\nSo of course, it was inevitable that popularly skipped cinematic curiosity Cats slunk its way back into our collective nightmare. (Or more specifically, slunk onto VOD earlier than scheduled.)\nAmong those experiencing the spectacle for the first time is actor Seth Rogen, who got high and watched Cats on Tuesday night. To be fair, it has been widely accepted that one of the best ways to watch Cats is under the influence. \nHowever, judging by Rogen's string of baffled tweets, being stoned doesn't appear to help the film about dancing humanoid felines make any more sense.\nAlso the scale is bizarre. The behind the scenes features, which are amazing, said the set is 2.5 times scale but that would mean cats are like  60 pounds in real life!— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 18, 2020\n\n\"I'm pretty stoned and watching Cats,\" Rogen tweeted at the outset of his journey through the cultural phenomenon. \"I've never seen the Broadway show. It is truly trippy. Am I supposed to know what a Jellicle is?\"\nPretty much nobody knows what a Jellicle is, but I sincerely doubt the knowledge would clear anything up.\nSEE ALSO: 'Cats' is the perfect movie for a virtual group hang during social distancing\n\"Judi Dench is in a cat fur coat which I can only assume is socially APPALLING in this world,\" Rogen noted, baffled by the whole cat couture situation.\n“Let’s make 35 nonsense songs introducing cats!” - The makers of cats.— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 18, 2020\n\nJudi Dench is in a cat fur coat which I can only assume is socially APPALLING in this world.— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 18, 2020\n\nWHAT IS JELLICLE?!,!?— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 18, 2020\n\nYou can find Rogen's entire descent into madness

more and more celebrities are filming PSAs for American citizens (from the safety of their own homes, of course).\nOn Friday, the cast of HBO's Watchmen debuted \"Washmen,\" featuring various actors, some in character, washing their hands for 20 seconds and urging viewers to do the same (but take it one step further than Laurie Blake and turn off the water, please).\nA Public Service Announcement from the heroic cast of #WatchmenHBO: pic.twitter.com/5ENTV75YdD— Jeff Jensen (@EWDocJensen) March 27, 2020\n\nMeanwhile, the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University virtually reunited the cast of Contagion, the 2011 pandemic movie currently surging in popularity, to do a series of PSAs about hand washing, social distancing, and more. (Experts from Mailman advised on the PSAs and consulted on Contagion during production.) Participating actors included Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Lawrence Fishburne, and Jennifer Ehle.\n\nYou can watch more of the Contagion PSAs (plus more to be added) here. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1256722%252Fd0275a0b-5549-49d9-a8de-97907d460960.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=Ers06EKcmzMWwO0SpdCT5rn_tqo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=X8PLRvSiHtZLhVXhgWeHN-pRVmY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=2f_onvGXou8wARPzEKH50vM8th0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=7I_lilevXSGDRYb2BynozDG9un8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=q5KstIBTMqxnRxuKgwcfePvpb8k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=9jrwtI0Iwp1xEp5AqqepqFuhDl0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'Watchmen,' 'Contagion' actors tell us how to keep safe from coronavirus","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=2f_onvGXou8wARPzEKH50vM8th0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=7ILMqVEEiWGVgNkNyL1txQMSgAE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=j4Cb78F6B0hANxtnt9-DESSZWl8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=q5KstIBTMqxnRxuKgwcfePvpb8k=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112649%252F97dfd469-9d24-430d-b8f9-ac28e91caf21.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=2f_onvGXou8wARPzEKH50vM8th0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"'Watchmen,' 'Contagion' actors tell us how to keep safe from coronavirus","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Wash your hands for 20 seconds by repeating \"You're an FBI agent, not the lone ranger\" eight times!","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Watchmen,' 'Contagion' actors tell us how to keep safe from coronavirus"},{"_id":"5e737ae028cc360227000016","id":"/shopping/march-19-vudu-half-off-movie-sale/","title":"Here's how to rent movies for super cheap right now","title_tag":null,"author":"Miller Kern","post_date":"2020-03-19T13:59:55+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 13:59:55 +0000","formatted_date":"03/19/2020","sort_key":"1JeVIf","link":"https://mashable.com/shopping/march-19-vudu-half-off-movie-sale/","content":{"plain":"{\"player\":{\"description\":\"Hulu and chill?

We've already exhausted our Netflix queue and we're in need of something new to watch. \nRight now, Vudu has a bunch of movies on sale for half off. You'll find movies that aren't available on Netflix or Hulu that you can rent for pretty cheap, with prices ranging from $0.99 to $2.99.\nThe movies included in this sale range from beloved classics like Goodfellas and The Hunger Games to some newer releases like The Peanut Butter Falcon and Judy. You'll likely find me watching (read: sobbing at) La La Land later on tonight.\nIf none of the half-off movies are satisfying your movie cravings, Vudu offers tons of other films at higher costs. The service even has early access to films like Little Women, 1917, and Cats. The service also has TV shows available.\nQueue up your next movie night with Vudu starting at $0.99 to rent.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Vudu rentals — starting at $0.99\n              See Details\n            \n          \n "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112228%252F09d0e9c4-d776-4c15-ab63-2101a4435cc2.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=sMdgbiAxw53cfGb7zJqy8b-5H5A=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112228%252F09d0e9c4-d776-4c15-ab63-2101a4435cc2.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=E569qa4K-kmIcXJ9yYXOjp-vLck=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112228%252F09d0e9c4-d776-4c15-ab63-2101a4435cc2.png%252F356x205.png?signature=poHkAT5WpjDo5dw_sN-oxAKu2D8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112228%252F09d0e9c4-d776-4c15-ab63-2101a4435cc2.png%252F712x410.png?signature=oPqQN7C4JxyonFk9XFoiG7jx8LQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112228%252F09d0e9c4-d776-4c15-ab63-2101a4435cc2.png%252F280x157.png?signature=i2sgyJzEPD_AEags-skcM9A17Dw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112228%252F09d0e9c4-d776-4c15-ab63-2101a4435cc2.png%252F560x314.png?signature=Z_oEOmpUFRJt3xIW6hKvgmvF-h4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Here's how to rent movies for super cheap right now","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112228%252F09d0e9c4-d776-4c15-ab63-2101a4435cc2.png%252F356x205.png?signature=poHkAT5WpjDo5dw_sN-oxAKu2D8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112228%252F09d0e9c4-d776-4c15-ab63-2101a4435cc2.png%252F280x157.png?signature=i2sgyJzEPD_AEags-skcM9A17Dw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112228%252F09d0e9c4-d776-4c15-ab63-2101a4435cc2.png%252F356x205.png?signature=poHkAT5WpjDo5dw_sN-oxAKu2D8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Here's how to rent movies for super cheap right now","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"buy_cta":[{"data-product-url":"https://zdcs.link/4B6X4","data-product-name":"Vudu rentals — starting at $0.99","data-product-img":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1250419%252F754407a8-d721-47c8-a245-df4a70292208.png%252Ffit-in__675x0.png?signature=cEAuP5TegkXMmxOCk-hv7kZ8Ut0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","data-product-img-credit":"vudu"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Watch new releases and old classics.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"Here's how to rent movies for super cheap right now"},{"_id":"5e7a5631f11b2c1b1600003d","id":"/article/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-coronavirus/","title":"'Wonder Woman 1984' release delayed due to coronavirus","title_tag":null,"author":"Angie Han","post_date":"2020-03-24T18:49:20+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 18:49:20 +0000","formatted_date":"03/24/2020","sort_key":"1JgOC4","link":"https://mashable.com/article/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-coronavirus/","content":{"plain":"Even superheroes are getting on board with social distancing. \nWarner Bros. announced today that Wonder Woman 1984 would be pushed back due to the coronavirus, moving from June 5 to Aug. 14.\nThe studio has also pulled from its calendar In the Heights (original release date: June 26), Scoob (original release date: May 15), and Malignant (original release date: Aug. 14).

Meanwhile, other films have had their VOD release dates pushed up — including Warner Bros.' other 2020 DC movie, Birds of Prey. \nIn the Heights producer Lin-Manuel Miranda also weighed in with a statement:\nAlright, mama, okay... pic.twitter.com/1uxOuUxe53— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) March 24, 2020"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111939%252Feaab9e4a-a473-4d28-84dd-282ece618173.jpeg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpeg?signature=AHCagjHpiFWwJGrGLtjW1dfSfZY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111939%252Feaab9e4a-a473-4d28-84dd-282ece618173.jpeg%252F1438x0.jpeg?signature=OiyoSWX08AT9QwyEBj7rhS4YvtQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111939%252Feaab9e4a-a473-4d28-84dd-282ece618173.jpeg%252F356x205.jpeg?signature=cn-46gXd7x-B3iZamEGvqASVBTo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111939%252Feaab9e4a-a473-4d28-84dd-282ece618173.jpeg%252F712x410.jpeg?signature=9-2bRXQFob7P7lAThOoeE0ioFcc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111939%252Feaab9e4a-a473-4d28-84dd-282ece618173.jpeg%252F280x157.jpeg?signature=7M3WUzbPPNlD7_wkLVsZ0GtHOIs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111939%252Feaab9e4a-a473-4d28-84dd-282ece618173.jpeg%252F560x314.jpeg?signature=4gSbxdGx8FbfzsoeQLRA9-Gn-W8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'Wonder Woman 1984' release delayed due to coronavirus","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111939%252Feaab9e4a-a473-4d28-84dd-282ece618173.jpeg%252F356x205.jpeg?signature=cn-46gXd7x-B3iZamEGvqASVBTo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpeg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111939%252Feaab9e4a-a473-4d28-84dd-282ece618173.jpeg%252F280x157.jpeg?signature=7M3WUzbPPNlD7_wkLVsZ0GtHOIs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111939%252Feaab9e4a-a473-4d28-84dd-282ece618173.jpeg%252F356x205.jpeg?signature=cn-46gXd7x-B3iZamEGvqASVBTo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"'Wonder Woman 1984' release delayed due to coronavirus","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"In the Heights,\" \"Scoob,\" and \"Malignant\" have also been postponed.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Wonder Woman 1984' release delayed due to coronavirus"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":4}

The social distancing and self-quarantine has many holed up at home, catching up on films they skipped at the cinema in a desperate attempt to keep themselves and their families non-homicidal.\nSo of course, it was inevitable that popularly skipped cinematic curiosity Cats slunk its way back into our collective nightmare. (Or more specifically, slunk onto VOD earlier than scheduled.)\nAmong those experiencing the spectacle for the first time is actor Seth Rogen, who got high and watched Cats on Tuesday night. To be fair, it has been widely accepted that one of the best ways to watch Cats is under the influence. \nHowever, judging by Rogen's string of baffled tweets, being stoned doesn't appear to help the film about dancing humanoid felines make any more sense.\nAlso the scale is bizarre. The behind the scenes features, which are amazing, said the set is 2.5 times scale but that would mean cats are like  60 pounds in real life!— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 18, 2020\n\n\"I'm pretty stoned and watching Cats,\" Rogen tweeted at the outset of his journey through the cultural phenomenon. \"I've never seen the Broadway show. It is truly trippy. Am I supposed to know what a Jellicle is?\"\nPretty much nobody knows what a Jellicle is, but I sincerely doubt the knowledge would clear anything up.\nSEE ALSO: 'Cats' is the perfect movie for a virtual group hang during social distancing\n\"Judi Dench is in a cat fur coat which I can only assume is socially APPALLING in this world,\" Rogen noted, baffled by the whole cat couture situation.\n“Let’s make 35 nonsense songs introducing cats!” -

Not wanting to move onto the Great Beyond, Joe's soul leaps out of line and ends up in the Great Before, the place where souls are prepared before life.

spread, you may be thinking to yourself, \"Hmm, maybe now is a great time to watch the 2011 medical thriller Contagion.\"\nHere's another thought: Do not watch the movie.\nOver the past few months, many people have turned to Steven Soderbergh's Contagion to prepare themselves for the coronavirus.\nThough Contagion is nine years old, the film is currently eighth on the U.S. iTunes chart for all movie genres, and third on the chart for most popular thrillers. The Verge also reports that Contagion is a Top 10 iTunes movie in Australia, and that torrent downloads of the film have significantly spiked since January. \nThe movie does have a stacked cast that includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Jude Law, and Kate Winslet, but the plot follows a frightening global pandemic, which means that it has the potential to further stoke people's coronavirus paranoia.\nSEE ALSO: Costco reportedly stops handing out free samples in some stores due to coronavirus\nWhile some people do find pandemic fiction \"comforting\" during a crisis, that's definitely not the case for everyone. \nWife and I watched “Contagion” tonight.Let me give you some advice: DO NOT WATCH “CONTAGION.”— Alexander Nazaryan (@alexnazaryan) March 6, 2020\n\nif you’re scared about #COVD19 you should watch contagion. it’ll make you feel much more scared.— Mike Majlak (@mikemajlak) March 3, 2020\n\nMe: watching Contagion is a dumb idea:: watches contagion ::Me: ((scrubbing hands)) fuck— feminist next door (@emrazz) March 7, 2020\n\nI am watching the 2009 film “Contagion”. Do not watch the 2009 film “Contagion”.— Ross Floate (@RossFloate) March 7, 2020\n\nif you want to still go outside and go about your life normally, do not watch the opening scene of Contagion at this time lmao— ruthie (@ruthieeeex) March 4, 2020\n\nhey siri why did I watch Contagion before going to sleep— Patrick Klepek (@patrickklepek) February 28, 2020\n\nEveryone: Don’t watch #Contagion during the #CoronaVirus Me: *immediately rents movie*Also me: *never touches another human or surface again* pic.twitter.com/0V0LWvMKAU— Anba (@bellebubs) March 4, 2020\n\nCan confirm it is not smart to watch Contagion (2011) at this moment in time.— Alex Mather (@AlexDRMather) March 6, 2020\n\nThe Husband: Wanna watch Contagion?Me: pic.twitter.com/nQQETJD6Gh— Melissa Murray (@ProfMMurray) March 5, 2020\n\nBefore you decide to watch timely virus-related entertainment like Contagion, Outbreak, or Netflix's Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak, really think about whether or not it's the best choice for you. Will it take your mind off reality for a few hours and lighten the mood, or will it simply make you feel worse?\nI personally know that a Contagion watch, as tempting as it may be, would send me into a stress spiral right now, so instead I'll be watching The Holiday. The romcom also stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet, but unlike Contagion it will make me feel GOOD.\n\nAt the time of writing this article more than 103,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed around the world, so it's understandable why people might feel anxious or compelled to watch an on-screen depiction of a worst-case scenario. But just because Contagion is trending and Gwyneth Paltrow Instagrammed about it doesn't mean you have to watch.\nYou can stay informed about the coronavirus while remaining calm. Keep washing your hands and try not to touch your face and watch something that makes you happy. Doesn't that sound a lot less stressful?"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111701%252Fa26ef83b-182e-491e-bed8-f8dbae8f568c.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=EvGafZmVPCHeR6D-GAobVte8vBg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111701%252Fa26ef83b-182e-491e-bed8-f8dbae8f568c.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=dA8k0tIdq3U5863zestZgfw6Zdo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111701%252Fa26ef83b-182e-491e-bed8-f8dbae8f568c.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=xdRXX9_-rErW5zxFEExxDQuLa5w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111701%252Fa26ef83b-182e-491e-bed8-f8dbae8f568c.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=4m_yJKUkSspa71wlU-Av5xYAjVA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111701%252Fa26ef83b-182e-491e-bed8-f8dbae8f568c.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=SJNbETfXUS-u1OKH0M4UcbAvWi4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111701%252Fa26ef83b-182e-491e-bed8-f8dbae8f568c.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=-DUPjD0zNeNXu08oeLdJehjqGcQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Reminder: You don't have to watch 'Contagion'","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111701%252Fa26ef83b-182e-491e-bed8-f8dbae8f568c.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=xdRXX9_-rErW5zxFEExxDQuLa5w=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111701%252Fa26ef83b-182e-491e-bed8-f8dbae8f568c.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=SJNbETfXUS-u1OKH0M4UcbAvWi4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111701%252Fa26ef83b-182e-491e-bed8-f8dbae8f568c.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=xdRXX9_-rErW5zxFEExxDQuLa5w=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Reminder: You don't have to watch 'Contagion'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"People really regret watching this movie.

The decision to delay the movie came jointly from MGM, Universal, producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and other producers on the series, the official 007 Twitter account tweeted Wednesday.\nMGM, Universal and Bond producers, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, announced today that after careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace, the release of NO TIME TO DIE will be postponed until November 2020. pic.twitter.com/a9h1RP5OKd— James Bond (@007) March 4, 2020\n\nBefore today, press tours for No Time To Die in China, South Korea, and Japan were canceled due to the coronavirus, referred to officially as COVID-19.\nWhile the folks behind the decision didn't go into detail about the exact reasoning behind the delay, it likely stems from the fact that people are less inclined to go out in public in the middle of an outbreak like this and the movie would likely take a financial hit. It also isn't great to encourage people to go out in public unnecessarily. Pushing the release back to November may give the world enough time to recover and hopefully by then the outbreak will be a thing of the past.\nSEE ALSO: Listen to Billie Eilish's moody Bond theme for 'No Time to Die'\nWhile this is the first movie release that's been affected, the virus has caused cancelations or delays all over. Google canceled its annual I/O conference because of the virus, the Game Developers Conference delayed its event to later in the year, and other major events like SXSW are seeing attendees and businesses pull out out of concern.\nOther major movies coming out around the same time as No Time To Die's original release date include Antebellum, Trolls World Tour, and Marvel's Black Widow. There is no word right now on if more of these movies will be delayed due to the coronavirus."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1234494%252F3086797c-be1c-418c-a165-408a7f94dcf8.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=id4fDdTrCkFRsv7AmbHXX1HhGQY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=kA1LD_sMl11UvbXG04GHxBy8zVM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.png%252F356x205.png?signature=IFVHpPwFqfg-3cS_e8cg4LlVN7E=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.png%252F712x410.png?signature=yfwT_Cn3h0Jt_wjL4OcFS_07sV4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.png%252F280x157.png?signature=CsrsW-wjUMm7nXnuOVtE6xnHZOA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.png%252F560x314.png?signature=fneFkw6IID2msyd_eNlq-Y3ctGU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'No Time To Die' release delayed until November due to coronavirus","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.png%252F356x205.png?signature=IFVHpPwFqfg-3cS_e8cg4LlVN7E=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=ujI1gnWT45IEndmSJV1rVB3zo2g=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=JFVvvS9KxkrHmVtI5GF3LQ4Gk0I=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.png%252F280x157.png?signature=CsrsW-wjUMm7nXnuOVtE6xnHZOA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111566%252F15ce6821-22df-48af-93ed-c8f11f00157e.png%252F356x205.png?signature=IFVHpPwFqfg-3cS_e8cg4LlVN7E=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"'No Time To Die' release delayed until November due to coronavirus","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The latest James Bond installment is being pushed back.

The world has changed since 1998, and Disney has made a serious, more violent Mulan that’s truer to the Chinese folklore.\n“Obviously Mushu is a beloved character, and one of the most memorable elements of the animated film,” Reed explained to a group of journalists huddled inside a tent on Mulan’s mountainous New Zealand set in October 2018.\n“It turns out that the traditional, Chinese audience did not particularly think that that was the best interpretation of the dragon in their culture. The dragon is a sign of respect and it's a sign of strength and power, and that using it as a silly sidekick didn't play very well with a traditional Chinese audience.”\nIt's one of many indications that unlike with The Lion King, Disney is not going for a by-the-numbers Mulan remake.\nDisney's Mulan, then and now\n\nWhile a classic to kids of a certain generation in the West, 1998’s Mulan flopped in China, released a year late after Disney was effectively banned for releasing the film Kundun, a film sympathetic to the Dalai Lama. On screens in Mulan’s birthplace, Hunan, the film only made $30,000 at the box office after three weeks. \nYou could blame the film’s late release in China, which caused some audiences to watch pirated versions months before its eventual arrival in theaters. But it's also likely that local audiences didn’t warm to the idea of Americans taking on a Chinese legend, especially one which already had multiple adaptations on film, TV, and stage.\n“This is not a Chinese dragon,\" one Chinese moviegoer told The Baltimore Sun in 1999. \"I can tell the people who designed the dragon are from America.\" \nIn that light, Disney’s resistance toward a comedic dragon sidekick in the new Mulan makes financial sense. Once chump change for Hollywood, China’s film market is set to overtake the U.S. this year. For Disney, its three biggest 2019 releases in China -- Captain Marvel, The Lion King and Aladdin -- accounted for more than $320 million in takings.\nDespite the omission of Mushu, Reed promises the film will be funny. Just admittedly not Eddie Murphy funny.\n\"We have some scenes that, although they're played very real, are gonna get some very big, big laughs.”\n“Take one of the greatest comedians of all time, make them a dragon, have him prance around, and give him like, two years refine the jokes — we're not gonna beat that, in terms of raw slapstick comedy,” he said.\n“But we have added a couple of elements to this movie which I think really do the same thing of grounding it, bringing you into it, we have some scenes [that], although they're played very real, are gonna get some very big, big laughs.”\nOther big changes are afoot as well. There aren’t any of those singalong theatrical musical numbers like “I’ll Make a Man Out of You,” “Reflection,” or “A Girl Worth Fighting For”, although Reed promises there will be “songs that you recognize and remember” in the movie. \nAlso gone is the cathartic scene in which Mulan cuts her hair in preparation for battle, which Reed admits he gets mocked for during meetings in China. “[It’s] actually a Western anachronism,” Reed explained. Chinese male warriors wore their hair long, and to cut Mulan’s hair would make her look more of a woman.\nNor will you see Mulan’s smart-mouth grandmother, Fa, or Li Shang in the live-action film. The latter decision has been particularly controversial, given Li Shang’s status as a bisexual icon. Reed was surprised by the backlash, but the decision was made in the light of the #MeToo movement.\n“I think particularly in the time of the #MeToo movement, having a commanding officer, that is also the sexual love interest, was very uncomfortable. We didn't think it was appropriate and we thought that in a lot of ways, that it was sort of justifying behavior that we're doing everything we can to get out of our industry,” Reed explained.\n\nInstead, the character of Li Shang will be split into two characters: Commander Tung, played by Ip Man star Donnie Yen, will serve as Mulan’s surrogate father and mentor in the film, while Chen Honghui, a role filled by New Zealander Yoson An, will be an equal to Mulan in the army and her eventual love interest.\nIt still leaves questions about how the queer element of the relationship between Mulan and Honghui will play out, or whether it will even be present. While homosexuality was decriminalized by China in 1997, Chinese censors are infamous for cutting out LGBTQ TV and movie scenes.\nChinese moviegoers saw no reference to Freddie Mercury’s sexuality in Bohemian Rhapsody, while Call Me By Your Name was pulled from official screenings (although it soon gathered a cult following). Disney doesn’t believe censorship will be a problem for Mulan, with Reed explaining it worked “very closely” with censors and its releasing partners in China.\n“We feel that we are secure in the censorship issue, that we have our permits approved and I believe that we will continue to have a good relationship with the releasing entities in our various partners in China,” Reed claimed.\nWhile the storyline will largely remain similar, new characters are joining the fray. A powerful shapeshifting witch, portrayed by Gong Li, will feature alongside the main antagonist Bori Khan, played by Jason Scott Lee. The story will begin with Mulan as a child, and she will have a younger sister in the film, something present in other adaptations of the folklore.\n“It makes it more than just her having to take care of her father and mother, who are sort of in the role of taking care of her,” Reed said. “By adding a younger sister we thought that it added sort of a broader emotional context, and added more motivation for her, particularly for the end.”\nMeet your new Mulan — and her new love interest\n\nOn the monitor inside our tent, actor Yifei Liu is effortless in her swordplay. It’s no surprise she’s landed the titular role; she is Mulan. Liu battled through a tough physical audition for the role, admitting to us she couldn’t walk properly after.\n“I wanted to thoroughly explore this girl,” Mulan’s director Niki Caro told Empire in February 2020. \n“Because I needed a warrior, and I needed a partner. So she did this grueling audition and then we sent her straight to the physical trainer to do an equally grueling physical assessment. Weights, push-ups, pull-ups, everything. She was brilliant in the dramatic part of the audition, and in the physical part she never stopped, never faulted. I knew at the end of that day that I’d found my warrior.”\nLiu has plenty of experience acting in wuxia films, a genre of martial arts films in China. Besotted, Mulan's filmmakers even pushed back production five months for Liu.\n“She was doing a television show and so she wouldn't be available to a certain point, and the point when she was available was terrible weather for us,” Reed said.\nLiu, who exudes confidence onscreen and is praised by her co-stars for her professionalism, is more reserved in conversation. She said she doesn’t try and think too much about how Chinese audiences will perceive her as Mulan. Nor would she be drawn on a question comparing the character of Mulan in the animated and the live action version.\n“I would not really compare, because I think each creation was its own form, and I really respect that,” Liu explains. “I’m also open to Mulan’s possibilities. We tried not to fix too many things.”\n\nFor Honghui actor Yoson An, who only has a handful of credits — mostly in his home country of New Zealand and in Australia — the whole international fame thing hasn’t quite set in.\n“I don't think it’s hit me yet, I don't know where it's gonna go until this movie’s released, I guess. I'm still kind of rolling with things, just one day at a time,” An said.\nAdmitting that he would’ve been looked over if the live-action Mulan had been a musical, An said he only picked up acting in his late teens, disillusioned with his university studies.\n“When I heard that Niki [Caro] was set to direct this movie back in 2014, I was like, ‘Oh, so cool. A New Zealander is set to direct Mulan,’ and I was just walking back to get my car and I was like, ‘Wouldn't it be cool if I played the love interest?’, just like a little thought in my head, and I thought, ‘No, that's never gonna happen.’ And then, four years later, here I am,” he said.\n\"It really dispels all the classic Asian stereotypes from all the other films.\"\nThe world of Mulan is inspired by the Tang dynasty, a golden age of imperial China during which it experienced flourishing trade with foreign nations and cultural advancement. In An’s eyes, Mulan could be a major moment for Asian diaspora worldwide -- although Liu’s praise for police during the Hong Kong protests last year has prompted calls for a boycott of the film.\n“In this film, the cast, you see people from different kinds of cultures interacting with each other and every single character has a multi-dimensional layer for them. So it really dispels all the classic Asian stereotypes from all the other films,” he explains.\n“And with what Black Panther has done for its community, and I really feel that Mulan is gonna do the same for the Asian community as a whole, taking on what Crazy Rich Asians has already done for Asian community, with the momentum it created.”\nLike Crazy Rich Asians, Mulan looked far and wide for Asian actors. There’s a mixture of Asian New Zealanders, Asian Australians, Asian Americans, and of course, Chinese actors. Mulan is mostly in English, to the joy of the subtitle-averse out there, and thus all actors are aiming towards a Chinese-influenced American dialect -- a goal which Reed admits has been “complicated.”\nIt’s no problem for An, who said he’s performed Chinese accents on screen before. Reminding us how young he is, An mentions he practiced as a kid to YouTube videos of Canadian stand-up comedian Russell Peters, who went viral a decade ago for his “Be a man! Do the right thing!” bit.\n“You guys know Russell Peters? Right? As a kid, I’d watch his stuff and do exactly as he did. But that's a very comical version of the accent, it’s very different to what we’re doing,” An said.\nMulan, but make it Disney\nIn research for its live-action reboot, Reed and the production team went back to the original ballad and the “many, many variations” which told in China since, including several modern film and television adaptations made in China -- before watching the Disney animated version again, thinking how Mulan would appeal to multiple audiences. \nWith the coronavirus shutting down all 70,000 of the country's theaters since Jan. 24, it's unclear — and more unlikely every day — that multiplexes will reopen in time for its planned release. (Several high-profile U.S. films, including Universal's Dolittle and 1917 and Searchlight's Jojo Rabbit, saw their February releases scrapped.) \n\"It certainly has worldwide and global appeal, but there's no denying that this is a very important film for the Chinese market,\" Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian told The Hollywood Reporter. \"It's a huge blow for Disney if it doesn't release in China.\" Disney president of production Sean Bailey told the publication he's \"looking at it day by day.\"\nWhenever and wherever it arrives, the hope is that Mulan will appeal to four audiences: the Asian diaspora community worldwide; women; Disney movie fans; and of course, a Chinese audience. But why would a Chinese audience watch another adaptation of Mulan? The answer lies in the hope that Disney can create something exceptional this time around.\n“One of the things that was made clear to us from the very beginning was, make a Disney movie. Don't try to make the Chinese version of Mulan, because they've already made it several times, and they've already seen it,” Reed explained.\n“So if you wanna make something that's going to play to the Chinese audience and be interesting to them, make the Disney version. And what that meant to us, was that we had to bring the highest level of execution, production, design, costume, hair and makeup, the cinematography. \n“The people that we hire, they were hired with the expectation that we wanted awards-caliber work, and they weren't meant to think about this as a kids movie or an animated remake, or any of those things.\n“Our references are David Lean and [Akira] Kurosawa — we're not looking at 101 Dalmatians.”\nUPDATE: Feb. 27, 2020, 1:12 p.m. PST This story has been updated to reflect the possibility of the coronavirus postponing the film's release

They'll also have a Top 10 badge if you search them elsewhere on the site.\n\nPer the press release, Netflix will update the lists every day, and their position on any given page will depend on how relevant the titles are to each user.\nIt's unclear what metrics Netflix is using to designate any given top 10 — how many people are currently streaming, how many complete views, list adds, clicks, etc. — but it's more insight than users have ever had into what trends and how on this platform.\nPlus, it gives you a good jumping off point for your next binge. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1222541%252F12f4716c-652b-4894-befb-e977ee5b7cd9.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=V2gfYQGKzcuojFpvVQnc7OzugLs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=SleScDvrcV5L1SKvAybM47XehZ0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=cHNai_j_w3HKZ00_j8YhhwRlwWo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=Rdgnarbo4QnSVj7WOPb7YfP1mQs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=F6Q3A_m40iH2WcW1oQB9JCr8KZ0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=ZPc-DHB-mg3fwpNG7JzkVv4d4ck=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Netflix adds new Top 10 feature to service for Movies and TV picks","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=cHNai_j_w3HKZ00_j8YhhwRlwWo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=0HHqii_vM3RwDZbr-CRl02zYdWM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=xWMbCxfYjXOqjcl4r6T3mUc908A=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=F6Q3A_m40iH2WcW1oQB9JCr8KZ0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111261%252Fad7782d9-19d4-45c1-adda-e6b043f9e24b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=cHNai_j_w3HKZ00_j8YhhwRlwWo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Netflix adds new Top 10 feature to service for Movies and TV picks","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"A literal popularity contest.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"Netflix adds new Top 10 feature to service for Movies and TV picks"},{"_id":"5e54f180ca2f0c7c5a000029","id":"/article/the-invisible-man-movie-review/","title":"'The Invisible Man' gets tripped up in the details","title_tag":null,"author":"Angie Han","post_date":"2020-02-25T10:05:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 10:05:00 +0000","formatted_date":"02/25/2020","sort_key":"1J6G9B","link":"https://mashable.com/article/the-invisible-man-movie-review/","content":{"plain":"Leigh Whannell's The Invisible Man may not have much in common with its ostensible source material, H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man. But its story should feel familiar all the same.\nElisabeth Moss plays Cecilia, who leaves her abusive husband only to discover she's in more danger than ever before, as Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) will do anything, up to and including turning himself invisible, to possess her. Worse still, no one around her quite seems to take her concerns seriously; even her well-meaning friends and family believe she's just being paranoid, or imagining things, or becoming unhinged.\nIt is, in short, a narrative about that oft-cited statistic that leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time for domestic violence victims. It's the truth underlying countless stories about killing sprees and mass shootings, and at the heart of so many true-crime podcasts and documentaries about this grisly murder or that one.\nThe Invisible Man lives and dies by its tiniest details.\nThe Invisible Man's challenge is turning that premise into passable entertainment, making room for an exploration of Cecilia's rocky emotional journey and super-cool VFX shots of an invisible dude throwing extras around. That it mostly manages to pull off the latter without trivializing the former is admirable. That both aims are hindered by another issue entirely is a slight disappointment.\nFrom its opening moments, the film lives and dies by its tiniest details. We first meet Cecilia tiptoeing around her own house in the dead of night, carefully gathering her things so she can escape through the front door before Adrian wakes. The scene trains you in The Invisible Man's particular brand of terror: every creak or rustle becomes a cause for panic, every lingering shot into a seemingly still room reason to tense up.\nWhannell, who wrote and directed, has a knack for keeping the viewer guessing — lulling us into a false sense of security just to yank us back out of it, or dialing down the intensity just as our frightened anticipation balloons to the point of bursting. The big action spectacles, when we get there, feel worth the wait, as the filmmakers know when to ramp up the dazzling \"invisible man\" effects and when to pull them back.\nThe character development proceeds on a similarly meticulous track. Moss is fantastic as usual in the role of Cecilia, showing us the character's jagged edges and her tender spots alike as she gradually pieces herself back together, opens up to her loved ones, and falls apart again. A character who seems unremarkable by design becomes, in her hands, forcefully alive, and worthy of our attention.\n\nAldis Hodge and Storm Reid, likewise, bring warmth and humor to their thinly drawn roles as Cecilia's friend and daughter. Through small kindnesses and grand gestures, they and Moss weave the kind of cozy domestic dynamic that could power Hallmark holiday films — which makes it all the more devastating when Cecilia's horrors begin anew.\nBut the film's demand that we pay close attention for any sign of the invisible man proves a double-edged sword. Just as his aggressions become harder and harder to ignore, so too do the film's narrative blemishes, from a dog that comes and goes from the story without explanation, to a late reveal that raises way more questions than it answers. \nThese missteps might be easier to overlook in a busier film, where they might get buried under an avalanche of plot twists and MacGuffins, or a more profound one, where they could be drowned out by powerful emotion or brilliant insight. The Invisible Man, on the other hand, is a simple story told in a relatively realistic visual style. There's nowhere for these blemishes to hide.\nCumulatively, their effect is to cast a shadow over everything else The Invisible Man is trying to accomplish. It's still a solid thriller with some nifty effects, a bunch of well-earned scares, and a riveting lead performance. It deserves credit for taking Cecilia and her plight seriously, and for its inventiveness with the visual and narrative possibilities of invisibility, and for its restraint in both arenas.\nBut stare at these seemingly empty spaces long enough, and the thoughts that linger are not about the unique challenges of surviving abuse, or the brilliance of using the invisible man as a metaphor, or even the awesomeness of the CG effects in that third-act fight scene. They're about things like how exactly that dog survived long enough to resurface later in the movie. Cecilia could tell you the devil is in the details. The Invisible Man could have used a reminder. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1219139%252F548a4b83-26db-47c2-9979-300665695aca.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=ClD-pd1Rrgqk-TpMvsm0watGXp0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=ahvvjZxphnrfYMHhGbrSQ8VzLos=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=w5nGYAdfV9CJvp8eMZ9B-E_FusI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=Xyz24bs3LMcNhRjae10nl8OdiyQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=-Ra0S4qbejfDFWDQNLIcipsE8oQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=3egOEQNJkLTj3-WE_gqG4fQLZSg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'The Invisible Man' gets tripped up in the details","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=w5nGYAdfV9CJvp8eMZ9B-E_FusI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=Ia3IJziAVUS6CPARZefXmniREJY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=GWzWsOJ0EBx4ZJzY73MihNHRwsY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=-Ra0S4qbejfDFWDQNLIcipsE8oQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111175%252Fd3b922f7-51a9-4d4e-ab62-8249bc935b04.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=w5nGYAdfV9CJvp8eMZ9B-E_FusI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"'The Invisible Man' gets tripped up in the details","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Do sweat the small stuff.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"'The Invisible Man' gets tripped up in the details"},{"_id":"5e48763bf11b2c11f8000007","id":"/video/back-to-the-future-deepfake-downey-holland/","title":"This deepfake of Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Holland in 'Back to the Future' is unreal","title_tag":null,"author":"Kellen Beck","post_date":"2020-02-15T22:52:42+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 22:52:42 +0000","formatted_date":"02/15/2020","sort_key":"1J37QI","link":"https://mashable.com/video/back-to-the-future-deepfake-downey-holland/","content":{"plain":"Out of all the faces to put on Doc Brown and Marty McFly in Back to the Future, I never knew how bad I needed it to be Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Holland.\nThis deepfake clip superimposes the faces of Downey Jr. and Holland over the original actors Christopher Lloyd and Michael J.
