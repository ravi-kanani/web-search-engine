We are driven by the realization that humanity is facing unprecedented social, intellectual, and spiritual challenges; our programs explore new ways of facing those challenges by using the arts and sciences dynamically as both a lens and catalyst. When humanity comes together and combines the ideas and talents of many, we have the ability to engineer what once appeared to be impossible.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center\">Values<\/h3>\n<p>Pioneer Works values curiosity, critical thinking, creativity, and inclusion. At the core, Pioneer Works aims to improve how to understand and regard each other and the world.

The factory, which manufactured railroad tracks and other large-scale machinery, was a local landmark after which Pioneer Street was named. Devastated by fire in 1881, the building was rebuilt, and remained in active use through World War II. Dustin Yellin acquired the building in 2011, and renovated it with Gabriel Florenz, Pioneer Works\u2019 Founding Artistic Director, and a team of talented artists, supporters, and advisors. Together, they established Pioneer Works as a 501c3 nonprofit in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Since its inception, Pioneer Works has built science studios, a technology lab with 3-D printing, a virtual environment lab for VR and AR production, a recording studio, a media lab for content creation and dissemination, a darkroom, residency studios, galleries, gardens, a ceramics studio, a press, and a bookshop. Pioneer Works\u2019 central hall is home to a rotating schedule of exhibitions, science talks, music performances, workshops, and innovative free public programming.<\/p>\n","appeal_video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kwONv6QzH_A","donation_appeal":"<p>Our ability to support artists, writers, educators and scientists pursuing experimental projects depends on your support.

        <p>“Prais’d be the fathomless universe,” Walt Whitman exulted on the pages of<i>&nbsp;Leaves of Grass</i>&nbsp;in 1856 as he was becoming Brooklyn’s most beloved artist. “New York City ought to have its&nbsp;Observatory,”&nbsp;<i>The New York Times&nbsp;</i>wrote in an impassioned op-ed that winter, extolling this “laudable aspiration” which citizens “have long cherished, and will not lightly abandon,” and proclaiming that “we shall yet have New-York observations made in a New-York&nbsp;Observatory.”</p> 
        <p>Pioneer Works is building New York City’s first-ever public&nbsp;observatory&nbsp;— a labor of love quietly underway, determined to redeem the six failed attempts that other dream-builders have made in the past century and a half. In a neighborhood graced with the lowest possible light pollution in New York City, in a culture needful of the cosmic perspective, we are proud to be building a dome of possibility for generations to come, devoted to education and enchantment, democratizing the science and the poetics of the universe, and making, in Whitman’s words, “all spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets” available to “all souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different.”</p>
