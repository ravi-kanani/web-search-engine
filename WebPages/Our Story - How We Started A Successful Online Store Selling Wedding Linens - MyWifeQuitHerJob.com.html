         <p>The year was 2007 and my wife and I were victims of a dreaded condition known as <strong>complacency</strong>. If youâve never heard of this terrible condition before, itâs a disease that leads to spending 10 hours a day at a job that you donât particularly like.</p>

          </noscript>Itâs an <strong>illness </strong>that stops you from pursuing your personal goals and aspirations because you can never find the time.</p>
         <p>Itâs a <strong>debilitating condition</strong> that causes you to trudge through each day doing the daily grind as life quickly passes you by.</p>
         <p>Back then, my wife and I used to get up early in the morning, go to work, eat dinner, sleep and then wake up again the next day to <strong>repeat the cycle</strong>.</p>
         <p>Days quickly faded into weeks, weeks dissolved into months and months soon became years of the <strong>same routine</strong>.</p>
         <p>Even though we both made a pretty good salary from our day jobs, we were coasting our way through life like <strong>lifeless zombies</strong>. After all, we werenât challenging ourselves. We werenât trying new things and we stayed within our <strong>comfort zone</strong> when making important decisions. We had no sense of purpose and we were unmotivated and stagnant.</p>
         <p>It sounds harsh, but my wife and I were lazy pieces of !@#$. Even though we had a lot of free time, we always ended up <strong>wasting it on empty activities</strong>. For example, our day consisted of working from 9-6:30pm, eating dinner and then watching television until it was time to go to bed.</p>
         <p>Days and weeks went by quickly and we <strong>didnât have anything to show for it</strong>. Even when I try really hard, I am unable to recall any specific memories during that period of my life. The only thing I remember is that I watched a hell of a lot of television and that <strong>my wife was terribly unhappy with her day job</strong>.</p>
         <p>In fact, the only memory that stands out in my mind was how much she <strong>dreaded having to go to work</strong> each and every day. Every morning she would kiss me goodbye and then say</p>
         <blockquote>
          <p>Okay, Honey. Iâm off to the hell hole I call my job!</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>It was particularly painful for me because I had to watch her drag herself out of bed and witness her suffer every morning.</p>
         <p>Even though she changed companies several times during her career, she <strong>never felt fulfilled working at any of her jobs</strong>. Whatâs ironic is that my wife and I had always wanted to start a business and be our own boss but we never got around to it. We talked about opening an online store many times but never took any action until it happenedâ¦.</p>

          </noscript><strong>My wife became pregnant!</strong> I still donât fully comprehend how peeing on a stick could stir up so many emotions, but my wife and I became excited and terrified at the same time. For one thing, I got a sudden injection of motivation and enthusiasm.</p>
         <p>All of a sudden I felt like I needed to get off my ass and become a better person. I felt like I needed to be more responsible and to <strong>take charge of my life</strong>. I felt like I needed to get my act together and provide for my family.</p>
         <p>As millions of thoughts swirled through my head, my primary concern became <strong>financial security</strong>. We needed a bigger house. We needed to live in a better school district. We needed to start a college education fund. We needed an emergency fund so large that we could survive even if I lost my job or got laid off.</p>
         <p>As for my wife, she wanted to <strong>quit her job</strong> so she could take care of our child full time. She didnât want to miss a single minute of our babyâs childhood. The only problem was that with the additional expense of having a child, she didnât want to place a major crimp on our lifestyle or our finances. As a result, we needed to find another way to make money and replace her six figure salary. Hence our online store, <strong>Bumblebee Linens</strong>, was born.</p>
