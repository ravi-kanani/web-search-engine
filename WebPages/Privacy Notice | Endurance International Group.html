         <p>We offer features that allow you to better target who you contact through our products and services.&nbsp; These features allow you to optimize your campaigns, segment your lists, and better customize your offerings to your customers.&nbsp; In order to do this, we partner with third parties who can provide you with information about your contacts. If both you and your contacts are located outside of the European Union, this may include demographic information and geographic location.&nbsp; We require that these third parties are contractually or legally permitted to share this information with you.</p>
         <p>In order to provide you with these features, we may send third parties certain pseudonymized personal data about your contacts.&nbsp; These third parties are prohibited from using this personal data for any purpose beyond that for which it was shared.</p>
         <p>We also share non-personal information with certain third parties, including the media, industry observers, marketing and advertising partners, vendors, customers, potential customers or partners.
