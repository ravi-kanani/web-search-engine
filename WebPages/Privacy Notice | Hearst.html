         <ul> 
          <li><strong>To perform our&nbsp;</strong><strong>contractual</strong><strong>&nbsp;obligations to you.</strong>&nbsp;We and our service providers process your information to perform our contractual obligations to you when we use your information to provide you with the Digital Services and related content, products or services and to communicate with you.&nbsp;For example, when you purchase a subscription from us, we process your payment and contact information as necessary to confirm the subscription and we process your contact information and other details to provide you with support services you request.&nbsp;We also send you informational communications on this basis, including to confirm a subscription or to notify you of a change to a Digital Service.&nbsp;Failure to provide requested information could prevent or delay the fulfilment of our contractual obligations.</li> 
          <li><strong>To pursue our legitimate interests.</strong>&nbsp;We process your information to meet our legitimate interests when we use your information to provide you with the Digital Services and related content, products or services, to communicate with you and for our advertising and marketing purposes.&nbsp;For example, our legitimate interests include making improvements to, customising and understanding how you interact with the Digital Services and related content, products or services, and sending you communications about products and services we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp;To accomplish our legitimate interests, we may share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries, service providers and business partners (including for our advertising and marketing purposes) and in the context of a corporate transaction.&nbsp;We maintain safeguards to protect the information we process to pursue our legitimate interests.</li> 
          <li><strong>To compl</strong><strong>y with our legal obligations.</strong>&nbsp;We process and share your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations when we use your information to protect our rights or the rights of others and when we share your information with other parties where required by law or as necessary to protect our rights. For example, we are required to collect certain information from you when processing your subscription payment for tax or financial reporting reasons.</li> 
          <li><strong>With your consent.</strong>&nbsp;We obtain your consent to process your information when we are required to do so by law.&nbsp;In relation to Cookies and Similar Technologies, we obtain your consent as described in our Cookies Policy.&nbsp;If consent is the legal basis on which we process your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the information provided in the 'Contact Us' section below.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p><strong>E. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</strong></p>

          <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>. In connection with the operation and provision of the Digital Services, Subscription Forms and the fulfilment of orders for our products or services, we engage various third parties to provide services or handle transactions on our behalf, such as payment processing, email distribution, list processing, postal mailing, cloud computing, analytics, digital content or print subscription performance measurement, ad serving, and managing sweepstakes, competitions, promotions or events.&nbsp;These service providers use the information we provide to them as necessary or appropriate for the performance of their services.</li> 
          <li><strong>Advertisers, Advertising- and Marketing-Related Service Providers and Partners</strong>. We may provide your information to advertisers, advertising agencies, ad networks, ad exchanges, marketing businesses, technology vendors and other entities that create, deliver and assess advertising or marketing campaigns, including interest-based ads.</li> 
          <li><strong>Social Media Platforms.&nbsp;</strong>If you interact with social media widgets, share content using social media share buttons, or access features of the Digital Services that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms, the relevant Social Media Platforms collect information.&nbsp;We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the Social Media Platforms that you engage with to understand their privacy practices, which we do not control.</li> 
          <li><strong>Business Partners</strong>. In certain circumstances we provide your information to business partners including, without limitation, joint marketing partners, content sponsors or event organizers, for various purposes.&nbsp; For example, we partner with a third party to offer products on a co-branded, co-sponsored or cross-promotional basis that involves the sharing of information.&nbsp;These initiatives take place on the Digital Services or on other media.&nbsp;The participation of a business partner in a particular initiative is communicated to you by the inclusion of the products, services or branding of the relevant business partner.</li> 
          <li><strong>Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Rights</strong>. We share your information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend our legal rights, the privacy or safety of our employees, users of the Digital Services or other individuals and entities, or to comply with or enforce applicable industry standards, law or legal process, including responding to court orders, warrants, subpoenas and other requests from public and government authorities.</li>

          <li><strong>With Your Consent or Otherwise at Your Direction</strong>. In addition, we share your information with third parties when you consent to or request such sharing.</li> 
         </ol> 
         <p>Because we operate as part of a global business, the recipients referred to above will sometimes be located outside the jurisdiction in which you are located (or in which we provide the Digital Services or Subscription Forms). See the section on 'International Data Transfer' below for more information.</p> 
         <p><strong>F. YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p> 
         <p>In certain circumstances, you have a right to access or object to the use of personal information held about you (including in relation to direct marketing).&nbsp;You can also ask us to rectify, update, erase, restrict or to share your information in a usable format with another company. &nbsp;Such requests are subject to applicable law.</p>

         </ol> 
         <p><strong>Interest-Based Ads Opt-Outs</strong></p> 
         <p>Depending on your preferences regarding the use of Cookies and Similar Technologies, ads you see on the Digital Services may be interest-based ads.&nbsp;This means that these ads are customised based on the information we and others obtain about you and involve the use of Cookies and Similar Technologies.&nbsp;We describe in our Cookies Policy steps you can take to limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of interest-based ads in browsers and mobile apps you use to access the Digital Services.&nbsp;Please keep in mind that if you opt out of interest-based ads, you will still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests.&nbsp;In addition, if you take the steps described in the Cookies Policy, some automated means will still be used to collect information about your interactions with the Digital Services for the other purposes described in this Privacy Notice (e.g., to remember user preferences or enable specific functionality).</p> 
         <p>The technologies used to deliver ads on websites and mobile apps differ.&nbsp; Please also remember that opt-outs are browser and device-specific.</p>

         </ol> 
         <p><strong>G. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p> 
         <p>We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure.</p>

          <li>Comply with record retention requirements under applicable laws or other relevant legal or regulatory requirements.</li>

         <p><strong>H. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER</strong></p>
