       <h3> 2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools </h3> 
       <p> As detailed in our <a href="#cookies">Cookie Policy</a>, Udemy and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (together, <strong>“Data Collection Tools”</strong>) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy. </p> 
       <p> We use cookies (small files that websites send to your device to uniquely identify your browser or device or to store data in your browser) for things like analyzing your use of the Services, personalizing your experience, making it easier to log into the Services, and recognizing you when you return. We use web beacons (small objects that allow us to measure the actions of visitors and users using the Services) for things like identifying whether a page was visited, identifying whether an email was opened, and advertising more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new mobile app download. </p> 
       <p> Udemy uses the following types of cookies: </p> 
       <p></p>
       <ul> 
        <li> <u>Preferences:</u> cookies that remember data about your browser and preferred settings that affect the appearance and behavior of the Services (like your preferred language).</li> 
        <li> <u>Security:</u> cookies used to enable you to log in and access the Services; protect against fraudulent logins; and help detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your account. </li> 
        <li> <u>Functional:</u> cookies that store functional settings (like the volume level you set for video playback). </li> 
        <li> <u>Session State:</u> cookies that track your interactions with the Services to help us improve the Services and your browsing experience, remember your login details, and enable processing of your course purchases. These are strictly necessary for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them then certain functionalities will break or be unavailable. </li> 
       </ul>
       <p></p> 
       <p> You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your experience may be different or less functional. </p> 
       <p> Some of the third-party partners who provide certain features on our site may also use Local Storage Objects (also known as flash cookies or LSOs) to collect and store data. </p> 
       <h3> 2.2 Analytics </h3> 
       <p> We use third-party browser and mobile analytics services like Google Analytics, Hotjar, and Intercom on the Services. These services use Data Collection Tools to help us analyze your use of the Services, including information like the third-party website you arrive from, how often you visit, events within the Services, usage and performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We use this data to improve the Services, better understand how the Services perform on different devices, and provide information that may be of interest to you. </p> 
       <h3> 2.3 Online Advertising </h3> 
       <p> We use third-party advertising services like Taboola, Facebook, Google’s ad services, and other ad networks and ad servers to deliver advertising about our Services on other websites and applications you use. The ads may be based on things we know about you, like your Usage Data and System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that these ad service providers know about you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and services, and may be tailored to your interests. </p> 
       <p> Depending on the types of advertising services we use, they may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, phone, or other device to collect data about your use of our Services, and may access those tracking technologies in order to serve these tailored advertisements to you. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in a non-human-readable form) and content that you share publicly on the Services. </p> 
       <p> When using mobile applications you may also receive tailored in-app advertisements. Apple iOS, Android OS, and Microsoft Windows each provide their own instructions on how to control in-app tailored advertising. For other devices and operating systems, you should review your privacy settings or contact your platform operator. </p>

       <p></p>
       <div role="alert" class="alert alert-info"> 
        <div class="content">
          We share certain data about you with instructors, other students, companies performing services for us, our business partners, analytics and data enrichment providers, your social media providers, companies helping us run promotions and surveys, and advertising companies who help us promote our Services. We may also share your data as needed for security, legal compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified or if we get your consent. 
        </div> 
       </div>
       <p></p> 
       <p> We may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy: </p> 
       <p></p>
       <ul> 
        <li><u>With Your Instructors:</u> We share data that we have about you (except your email address) with instructors or teaching assistants for courses you enroll in or request information about, so they can improve their courses for you and other students. This data may include things like your city, country, browser language, operating system, device settings, the site that brought you to Udemy, and your activities on Udemy. If we collect additional data about you (like age or gender), we may share that too. We will not share your email address with instructors or teaching assistants. We also enable our instructors to implement Google Analytics on their course pages to track sources of traffic to their courses and optimize their course pages. </li> 
        <li><u>With Other Students and Instructors:</u> Depending on your settings, your shared content and profile data may be publicly viewable, including to other students and instructors. If you ask a question to an instructor or teaching assistant, your information (including your name) may also be publicly viewable by other users depending on your settings. </li> 
        <li><u>With Service Providers, Contractors, and Agents:</u> We share your data with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing, data analysis, marketing and advertising services (including retargeted advertising), email and hosting services, and customer services and support. These service providers may access your personal data and are required to use it solely as we direct, to provide our requested service. </li> 
        <li><u>With Business Partners:</u> We have agreements with other websites and platforms to distribute our Services and drive traffic to Udemy. For example, we work with Benesse in Japan. Depending on your location, we may share your data with these partners. </li> 
        <li><u>With Analytics and Data Enrichment Services:</u> As part of our use of third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics and data enrichment services like Clearbit, we share certain contact information, Account Data, System Data, Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1), or de-identified data as needed. De-identified data means data where we’ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information (including contact and social information from other sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner. </li> 
        <li><u>To Power Social Media Features:</u> The social media features in the Services (like the Facebook Like button) may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature. Your interactions with these features are governed by the third-party company’s privacy policy. </li> 
        <li><u>To Administer Promotions and Surveys:</u> we may share your data as necessary to administer, market, or sponsor promotions and surveys you choose to participate in, as required by applicable law (like to provide a winners list or make required filings), or in accordance with the rules of the promotion or survey. </li> 
        <li><u>For Advertising:</u> If we decide to offer advertising in the future, we may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to show general demographic and preference information among our users. We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), and to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioral advertising) and undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. To learn more or opt out from participating ad networks’ behavioral advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below. Note that if you opt out, you’ll continue to be served generic ads. </li> 
        <li><u>For Security and Legal Compliance:</u> We may disclose your data to third parties if we (in our sole discretion) have a good faith belief that the disclosure is: </li> 
        <ul> 
         <li type="circle"> Permitted or required by law; </li> 
         <li type="circle"> Requested as part of a judicial, governmental, or legal inquiry, order, or proceeding; </li> 
         <li type="circle"> Reasonably necessary as part of a valid subpoena, warrant, or other legally-valid request; </li> 
         <li type="circle"> Reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other legal agreements; </li> 
         <li type="circle"> Required to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential violations of law (or rule or regulation), or security or technical issues; or </li> 
         <li type="circle"> Reasonably necessary in our discretion to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Udemy, our users, employees, members of the public, or our Services. </li> 
         <li type="circle"> We may also disclose data about you to our auditors and legal advisors in order to assess our disclosure obligations and rights under this Privacy Policy. </li> 
        </ul> 
        <li><u>During a Change in Control:</u> If Udemy undergoes a business transaction like a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or some of its assets, we may share, disclose, or transfer all of your data to the successor organization during such transition or in contemplation of a transition (including during due diligence). </li> 
        <li><u>After Aggregation/De-identification:</u> we can disclose or use aggregate or de-identified data for any purpose. </li> 
        <li><u>With Your Permission:</u> with your consent, we may share data to third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy. </li>

       <h3> 7.1 Users in California </h3> 
       <p> Users who are California residents have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, (“CCPA”). If you are an eligible California user, included in these rights are: </p> 
       <p></p>
       <ul> 
        <li> <strong>“Right to Know”</strong> — You have the right to request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you and access a copy of your personal information.</li> 
        <li> <strong>“Right to Deletion”</strong> — You have the right to request deletion of personal information that we have collected about you. </li> 
        <li> <strong>“Right to Non-Discrimination”</strong> — If you choose to exercise any of your rights under CCPA, Udemy will treat you like all other users. In other words, there is no penalty for exercising your rights under CCPA. </li> 
       </ul>
       <p></p> 
       <p> To exercise any of these rights under CCPA, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@udemy.com" id="" class="">privacy@udemy.com</a> or write to us at Udemy, Inc., Attn: Privacy/Legal Team, 600 Harrison Street, 3rd floor, San Francisco CA 94107. As part of the CCPA you may designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. For your protection, we may require that the request be sent through the email address associated with your account, and we may need to verify you and/or your agent’s identity before fulfilling your request. </p> 
       <p> Additionally, for more information about the personal information we collect and how we collect it, please see the sections above entitled “What Data We Get” and “How We Get Data About You.” </p> 
       <p> To learn about the business and commercial purposes for which your personal information is collected and the categories of service providers who have access to your personal information, please see the sections above entitled “What We Use Your Data For” and “Who We Share Your Data With.” </p> 
       <p> Most importantly, per the CCPA, <strong>Udemy does not sell your personal information or the personal information of any of our users</strong>. </p> 
       <p> As a California resident, you also have the right to request certain details about what personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To submit your request, send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@udemy.com" id="" class="">privacy@udemy.com</a> with the phrase “California Shine the Light” and include your mailing address, state of residence, and email address. </p> 
       <p> Since the internet industry is still working on Do Not Track standards, solutions, and implementations, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals. </p> 
       <h3> 7.2 Users in Nevada </h3> 
       <p> As is the case for all of its users, <strong>Udemy does not sell its users’ personal information or personal data</strong>. Nonetheless, if you are a resident of Nevada, and would like to request that we do not sell your personal information, you can request to opt out of the sale of covered information by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@udemy.com" id="" class="">privacy@udemy.com</a> or writing to us at Udemy, Inc., Attn: Privacy/Legal Team, 600 Harrison Street, 3rd floor, San Francisco CA 94107. </p>
