   <p>This Policy does not address, and except as otherwise described in this Policy, we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including our vendors or any other third party operating any site or service to which the Ad Services or Drudge Report Properties link.&nbsp; The inclusion of a link through the Ad Services or Online Property does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.</p> 
   <p>Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Ad Services or Drudge Report Properties.</p>

   <p><strong>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?</strong></p> 
   <p>We use reasonable organizational, technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process.&nbsp; The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and to help ensure that your data is safe and secure.&nbsp; However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.</p> 
   <p><strong>4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p> 
   <p>We will retain personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy and where we have ongoing legitimate business needs to do so (for example, to provide the Ad Services, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations) unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p> 
   <p>If you are an End User, we may retain information that we collect through the Ad Services (including the segment information that we receive from third parties) for up to 45 days from the last date that we received any of the End User’s data.&nbsp; We may retain ad impression information for up to 45 days.&nbsp; We may retain raw ad server logs for our mobile ad server business for up to 45 days.&nbsp; We use precise geolocation for the specific ad impression to which the geolocation relates, after which the geolocation information is aggregated with other geolocation data for use by us for analytical purposes.&nbsp; If we de-identify information we collect through the Ad Services, we may retain that information, in an aggregated format, indefinitely.&nbsp; In such cases, we commit to not re-identifying the information.&nbsp; If we are required to retain information to comply with a legal or audit obligation, we may store End User information for longer periods.</p>
