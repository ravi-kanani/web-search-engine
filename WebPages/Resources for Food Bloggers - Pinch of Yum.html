Not only does the 6D shoot incredible pictures, but it also shoots really incredible HD video. It’s an expensive camera, so if you’re just getting started look first at purchasing something like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2lYOAf5" target="blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canon EOS Rebel SL1</a>

It’s an amazing lens that has stood the test of time for me (I used the Nikon version when I first started and now I’m using the Canon). It isn’t cheap, but you get what you pay for with a lens. This lens is considered a prime lens, which means that it doesn’t zoom in or zoom out. You’re only able to shoot at 50mm, which isn’t a big deal with food photography (food is pretty good at sitting still). I shoot 40% of all my food photos with this lens, and I highly recommend it if you’re looking for a really good starter lens.

It’s a prime lens, like the 50mm, but it’s going to be geared towards getting you that great macro shot right up close to your food. It’s great for showing texture and creating a look that says: FEED ME NOW. The only thing that I would say about this lens is that because the frame is getting a smaller area of space, you might need to use a smaller aperture (like 5.0 or 6.0) which requires you to bump your ISO a lot higher than you would with the 50mm. For example, with 50mm I would use settings like f/2.8, 1/60, and 200 ISO, but with the 100mm lens I would be using settings like f/5.0, 1/60, and 1000 ISO.

Unlike the 50mm prime lens, this lens has a really dramatic zoom factor, so you can sit far back from a group of people and still get some great candid close-ups without them even knowing. So basically it’s a good lens for being creepy. I use this most frequently for family, engagement, maternity, and travel photos. This is going to be awesome for any type of photos that involve people and places.

This is going to give you a shot that’s farther back than the rest which allows for more styling and flexibility in tight spaces (like my kitchen). I tend to like to get in UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL with the food, which is why I like the 50mm and 100mm over the 28mm, but that being said, I love this lens for overhead shots of food because you don’t have to climb on 83 chairs to get high enough for the shot.

This is especially important if you’re shooting your photographs in RAW mode or recording video. If you have room in your budget it might even be worth it to buy a couple of these, just in case.

It’s a food blogger’s dream come true. The amount of traffic you can send to your blog through Pinterest is incredible. It’s also incredible how much time you can spend on Pinterest if you’re not careful. As a blogger, your primary focus should be on creating quality content for your blog. That’s why I’ve decided to have our social media intern manage the Pinch of Yum Pinterest page. Together we are able to quickly and easily schedule pins for Pinterest using <a href="http://viralt.ag/1zkh0Ep#sthash.JN4XEXli.dpuf" target="blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Viraltag</a>.

          <p>Here is a list of the &nbsp;food photo submission sites that I use. There are SO many out there, but the ones listed here are just the ones that I submit to. It can take some time to go through the process of entering a submission, but the traffic you gain from getting a submission accepted can be great! It’s not uncommon to see 1,000 – 1,500 people visit your blog in a day if you get a submission featured on the right site at the right time. I also think that having links on these sites helps get your content in front of more people who might be likely to share the recipes and pictures on Pinterest or other social media.</p>
