That's the one thing we all have in common. \nIt's also the electric current running through Feel Good, a powerful new comedy written and created Mae Martin and Joe Hampson for Channel 4 and Netflix. \nFeel Good is hitting our screens at a time when we need it the most. That's not just because we're all massively in need of new shows to watch as we practice social distancing. It's because this is a programme about love, and all the complicated ways we behave in our quest to find another human who wants to be with us forever. \nMae Martin plays Mae, a rising star in comedy who falls in love with George, a woman who's previously only dated men. We later learn that this dynamic is something of a pattern for Mae, who has a history of dating women who — up 'til meeting her — identify as straight. \nThings between Mae and George (Charlotte Ritchie) are going pretty swimmingly for a while — that is, until they run into hot water. George won't come out to her friends and family, and ends up making up an imaginary boyfriend called Jonathan Crenshaw so all her friends will stop asking questions. But the fact that George won't introduce Mae to any of her friendship group leaves Mae feeling distinctly stashed away and insecure. \n\nWhile Mae's insecurities skyrocket, George lets slip a sentence during sex that definitely doesn't assuage Mae's anxieties: \"Come inside me.\" Mae responds, \"You just said 'come inside me' and I physically can't.\" Mae has something that I — and many others — can surely relate to. That something is a masochistic propensity to want what you cannot have. To chase after something or, crucially, someone who cannot love you. It makes for tortured, but highly resonant viewing.\nIn many ways, this show is about people's personal histories meeting their present day stories. Mae struggles to shake off the guilt she feels about her behaviour when she was an addict. That past hits her present head-on, however, when she relapses. For George, the looming shadow of her dating history is ever-present. George is coming to terms with her sexuality, while Mae frets that she'll never live up to the men George has previously dated. \nSEE ALSO: Romance, toxic relationships, and addiction drive trailer for comedy series 'Feel Good'\nWhen Mae's parents fly from Canada to the UK to scatter the ashes of their beloved cat on Blackpool beach (yes, I realise that's a lot to take in), the shit really hits the proverbial fan. Lisa Kudrow plays Linda, Mae's truculent diva of a mother — to great comic effect. I certainly never expected to witness Kudrow chomping on a Scotch egg in Blackpool, England, but it works. Like Mae, Linda is a complicated woman. She doesn't want to hear her daughter's apology and adopts evasive tactics to try to steer the conversation elsewhere. \n\nAs you watch Feel Good, the emotive writing really shines through. George's line \"Mae you have so many feelings but it's your head\" couldn't be more true. Martin and Hampson have created something that speaks to some pretty universal feelings — yearning to be loved and wanting something that is out of reach. \"I've been with good people, really good people, people who love me, and I lie next to them and I just feel so restless,\" says Mae as she lies next to George. \"And then when I lie next to you, I feel still, and quiet deep inside.\"\nThat said, it's not all deep feelings. Along Mae's journey, you'll meet some truly bonkers characters. Like her NA sponsor Maggie (Sophie Thompson) who has a daughter called Lava (named after the volcanic kind). You'll meet Phil (Phil Burgers), Mae's strange housemate, who gifts George a bucket of worms to cheer her up. And there's even a douchey manspreader who utters the line, \"I'm actually a pretty woke guy. I loved Call Me By Your Name.\"\nFeel Good made me feel things. Sitting in my flat on Day 3 of Not Going Outside, I watched all six episodes and wept. I needed to feel something other than anxiety, and Feel Good helped me to do it.  \nFeel Good is available to watch now on Channel 4 and Netflix. \n\n "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1250020%252F44fc27e8-8b10-48ea-b815-4a24bb843a20.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Re7Q_Bt3Gfpe2EA4nxdxtN1lrOw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=h93NU7C0UL7PYfklUFobciUnO9U=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F800x360.png?signature=6u-dzHeif8Nx-AmP9OJbSDZiC90=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F1600x720.png?signature=ZnAX8EjygdxsmCWi6t9QGr4NQks=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'Feel Good' brings the complex rom-com energy you need in your life right now","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F800x360.png?signature=6u-dzHeif8Nx-AmP9OJbSDZiC90=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.webp%252F800x360.webp?signature=seSuWSqqGWPlqB2jH_nTFwLTm5A=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","naturalWidth":"800","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F800x360.png?signature=6u-dzHeif8Nx-AmP9OJbSDZiC90=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","sizes":"800w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"'Feel Good' brings the complex rom-com energy you need in your life right now","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Mae Martin's new show will make you feel things.

And if you’ve already played Persona 5, chances are you loved it.\nThe Japanese RPG received overflowing praise upon its 2017 English release, exciting players with a satisfying blend of school life and dungeon crawling. If that wasn’t enough, the engaging turn-based battles came wrapped in striking style and a funky acid jazz soundtrack, making Persona 5 one of the most memorable games of the year.\nReleasing Mar. 31, Persona 5 Royal is essentially the same game with a few tweaks and additions. The biggest change is the inclusion of several new characters, most notably gymnast Kasumi Yoshizawa. There are more activities, new areas, revamped battles, expanded dungeons, and a couple of new mechanics. However, like piling sweets atop an iced cake, none of this alters the game’s delicious base. \nWhether that’s good or bad depends upon your point of view.\n\nBoth Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal place you in the shoes of a high school student whose undeservedly bad reputation has followed them to their new school. Adults think you’re a problem, and other kids believe you’re dangerous. It’s shaping up to be a miserable and lonely year. That is, until you awaken the supernatural power that allows you to enter people’s psyches (known as \"Palaces\") and steal their evil desires. \nMuch like our own world, Persona 5 is full of exploitative adults inflicting suffering upon others for their own gain. It’s a cruel, unjust society driven by greed and apathy. However, by fighting their subconscious selves in a Pokémon-like battle and stealing their desires, you can induce a “change of heart” and prompt them to repent.\nSEE ALSO: 'Persona 5' review round-up: Social sim + dungeon crawler = YAY\nYou also have to maintain a normal high school life while doing so, keeping up with your studies, making friends, and even working a part-time job. Fortunately, Persona 5 makes hanging out with friends just as engaging as dungeon-crawling with them. Regardless of whether you’re levelling up relationships or yourself, there’s a constant sense of accomplishment and progress.\nIf you haven’t played Persona 5, discovering the joys of optimising your schedule is a ton of fun even if you aren't a big bullet-journaling nerd. Persona 5 Royal’s new additions may be lost on you, but that doesn’t matter when the base game is already terrific. If you did play Persona 5, the tweaks are a great excuse to replay the 100-hour game. Royal feels as though it’s aimed at fans, with revamped character portraits and familiar faces appearing earlier than expected like in-jokes. However, you will be more sensitive to the changes, and not all of them are improvements.\n\nThe differences start from Persona 5 Royal’s brand new cinematic opening, which feels busier and not quite as catchy as Persona 5’s slick opening. This immediately signposts Royal's new, alternate universe — it’s still Persona 5, but not quite as you remember.\nAt least one of Royal’s alterations address fan gripes from Persona 5. Rather than not-a-cat Morgana enforcing your bedtime with an iron paw, you can now do stat-boosting activities during the evening such as cleaning the cafe for Kindness or studying for Knowledge. It feels less like you’re wasting time, which is great considering how much of the game is time management. \nHowever, most changes aren’t so much improvements as optional additions. Palaces have a few extra rooms, as well as Will Seeds which coalesce into equipment once all are collected. The new grappling hook looks and feels cool, though it can only be used at certain allocated points, much like jumping. Some enemies, or Shadows, have been upgraded to Disaster Shadows which damage other enemies upon defeat.\n\nBoss battles have been tweaked, some Shadows’ weaknesses changed, and endless dungeon Mementos now has a new shop. Relatively minor alterations are also found in student life, including new areas to visit with friends. None of this drastically changes the game, but together it’s just enough to make fans curious for a replay.\nThere are a few bigger changes, such as the Thieves’ Hideout. However I’m not a big fan of virtual trophy rooms, so this didn’t thrill me. It’s nice to be able to rewatch cutscenes or play some of the game’s jazzy musical tracks, but this could just have easily been achieved by a menu. Running between platforms to access this content is just annoying. \nFurther, you have to buy this content with P Medals. These are earned by fulfilling objectives during general gameplay, or by playing new mini-game Tycoon. Though the card game is mildly entertaining for a few rounds, it’s completely separate from the main game and doesn’t affect in-game progress. As a result, it ends up feeling like that waste of time you're trying to avoid.\n\nArguably the biggest change is the introduction of Kasumi Yoshizawa. There are three new characters in Persona 5 Royal, one of them the owner of Mementos’ new shop, but most promotion has focused on Kasumi.\nThe concept of an entirely new playable character is exciting. A fresh addition to your party, Kasumi is a talented gymnast and student who transfers to your school around the same time as you. Unfortunately, Persona 5 Royal incorporates Kasumi rather clumsily at the outset. The new girl doesn’t so much as slide quietly in like a phantom thief as loudly declare her presence, practically crowing about how awesome she is. \nSEE ALSO: 'Persona 5' explained: Is this 100-hour game for you?\nKasumi’s insertion in the opening sequence causes it to lose focus, interrupting the flow and diluting the player character’s introduction as the cool, competent leader. I found myself resenting her a bit — it was my hero moment, not hers. She then proceeds to pop up randomly during the early game without contributing to the main narrative, feeling more like a distraction than anything.\nWhile other characters such as Ann and Ryuji naturally join the plot as their storylines dovetail with the protagonist’s, Kasumi feels tacked on, appearing just to remind the player she’s there. It’s unsurprising in a way, since she wasn’t in Persona 5 at all, but it would have been less jarring were she was introduced later and more naturally.\n\nKasumi hasn’t joined my party yet, so I can’t speak as to her abilities. Most of the truly new content is deeper into the game, including her storyline. At 16 hours in, having just finished the first Palace and unlocked Mementos, I’m far from seeing Persona 5 Royal’s new Palace or meeting the last new character — a Confidant you can build a relationship with to gain new abilities.\nStill, I don’t begrudge the wait. It’s been long enough since Persona 5 was released that the replay feels exciting, particularly with the changes. And if it means the new characters and stories are better integrated into the main narrative, I’m all for it.\nIf you enjoyed Persona 5 you’ll enjoy Persona 5 Royal, though it’s hard to say it’s necessarily better. It’s just slightly different. As such, the $60 price tag may feel steep to all those but die-hard fans and total newbies, as anyone hoping for a completely new experience will be disappointed — particularly as Persona 5 is available for $20.\nPersonally, having played over 200 hours of Persona 5, I’ve been able to enjoy Royal's changes and largely gloss over aspects that don’t quite work. I do however miss popular exploits such as Confusion farming, the removal of which has made it harder to max out your bank balance. \nPlease, Royal. You gave me the fantasy of righting injustice with a close group of supernaturally-powered friends. Leave me my fantasy of unlimited wealth.\nPersona 5 Royal launches Mar. 31 on PlayStation 4."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1248004%252F436796fe-96bf-4ef5-9d9b-2ae93ae0925e.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=ObmiYqWE_71GU8o68s_l6pOt97I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112097%252F59daeb62-6d19-4c56-ad84-09730cffb800.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=eKnOiQt8l9Gc_Cu5Bpxe0IPZsB0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112097%252F59daeb62-6d19-4c56-ad84-09730cffb800.png%252F280x158.png?signature=qAFq8E8mey0fkTJiRZWzRMTS7Uc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112097%252F59daeb62-6d19-4c56-ad84-09730cffb800.png%252F560x316.png?signature=2o5nTe16HTr9J3n_g5ZdoofRg7g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'Persona 5 Royal' first impressions: Same same but different","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112097%252F59daeb62-6d19-4c56-ad84-09730cffb800.png%252F280x158.png?signature=qAFq8E8mey0fkTJiRZWzRMTS7Uc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112097%252F59daeb62-6d19-4c56-ad84-09730cffb800.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=qf1P-rRZDVYv5gggnpTQXc91hR0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112097%252F59daeb62-6d19-4c56-ad84-09730cffb800.png%252F280x158.png?signature=qAFq8E8mey0fkTJiRZWzRMTS7Uc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"'Persona 5 Royal' first impressions: Same same but different","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Whether that's good or bad depends upon your point of view.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Persona 5 Royal' first impressions: Same same but different"},{"_id":"5e510a209111ae6a5d00001c","id":"/review/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review/","title":"Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Review: Better sound and battery, but these are no AirPods Pro","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2020-02-22T11:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 11:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"02/22/2020","sort_key":"1J5ESh","link":"https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review/","content":{"plain":"When Samsung first released its Galaxy Buds in 2019, I wrote that the company had come very, very close to nailing everything that makes Apple's AirPods great. \nSo when the company showed off its new Galaxy Buds+ which, in addition to upgraded specs, are officially iPhone-compatible, the natural comparison was to the AirPods Pro. And, at $149, the Galaxy Buds+ are certainly priced to undercut Apple. \nBut after using the Galaxy Buds+ for more than a week, I'm left with an impression similar to last year's first-generation Galaxy Buds: There's a lot to like, especially if you use a Samsung phone. But these are no AirPods Pro replacement and iPhone owners might be disappointed if they're expecting the same level of quality as Apple's high-end AirPods. \nSame buds, (a few) new tricks\nThe Galaxy Buds+ look almost identical to last year's Galaxy Buds and come in the same pill-shaped charging case. It's a little bigger than the AirPods Pro charging case, but not by much —it still slips easily into just about any pocket.\nThe buds themselves are also unchanged from last year's design. They come with the same swappable tips and each bud has a small touchpad that lets you control music playback and sound settings. \n\nAs I wrote in my review last year, I have tiny ears, so thicker buds, like the Galaxy Buds, are almost always uncomfortable after extended use. That's still true with the Galaxy Buds+. But, again, I expect this won't be an issue for most people.\nI also still don't love the design of the touchpad, which I almost always unintentionally press when taking the Galaxy Buds+ in and out of my ears. After a solid of week of use, I managed to figure out a technique where I gingerly pluck each bud out of my ears without accidentally pressing the touchpad. But putting them in without pressing it is still a challenge.  \nWhile they may look the same as last year's buds, the biggest are upgrades with the Galaxy Buds+ are the things you can't see. Battery life, for example, now tops out at 22 hours — 11 hours for the buds and the charging case, respectively — which is a major improvement from last year's version which maxed out at 13 hours of total playback time.\n\nSamsung also did away with one of my biggest complaints with last year's buds: You no longer need two separate apps and a Samsung account in order to get that \"seamless\" AirPods-like pairing experience (assuming you have a compatible Samsung phone). Instead, you now need just a single Android app, Galaxy Wearable. But if you use a non-Samsung Android phone, you might also need the Galaxy Buds+ \"plugin,\" which requires a separate download. It's not exactly seamless, but at least it doesn't require you to use Samsung's Smart Things app which, honestly, no one should ever have to use.\nThe company also made some upgrades to the sound quality, adding additional microphones and improved drivers. It's a noticeable difference, but not hugely so. Music still sounds pretty good — just not great, which is to be expected with wireless earbuds. They don't sound as good as my AirPods Pro, but maybe a bit better than my first-gen AirPods. And while they don't have the same noise canceling abilities as AirPods Pro, the sound isolation is definitely better than most. \nThe difference was even more noticeable in ambient mode. While I found ambient mode in last year's Galaxy Buds to be pretty weak, ambient mode with the Galaxy Buds+ actually makes a big difference. With ambient mode on the lowest setting I was more than able to hear noise from my surroundings in addition to my music. \niPhone-friendly... mostly\nThe most intriguing change Samsung made is the addition of an iOS app which makes the Galaxy Buds+ officially iPhone-compatible... sort of. (The original Galaxy Buds can technically pair to iPhones, but without the accompanying app, your functionality is extremely limited.) \nI did however have a couple of issues while using the Galaxy Buds+ with my iPhone that make me hesitant to recommend them to iPhone users. While pairing to iOS is meant to be relatively painless thanks to the dedicated app, I found it to be a  slightly more complicated process than Samsung let on.\n\nFor one, you need to pair them in your main Bluetooth settings before you attempt to pair them in the app. If you pair using the app and then in your Bluetooth settings, the buds will connect, but might not actually play any sound. I also found, bizarrely, that my buds often paired as two separate devices and that I needed to connect to both devices in order for them to work.\nAdditionally, I encountered another issue that made it very difficult to take phone calls with the Galaxy Buds+. For some reason, every time I answered a call, the audio would switch back to my iPhone speaker and I had to manually change the source in order to hear the call through the buds. The phone wasn't losing the Bluetooth connection, it just wouldn't use it as the default for incoming phone calls. \nA Samsung representative told me these issues were likely unique to my specific pair of Galaxy Buds+, but I was unfortunately unable to confirm that. In any case, I was able to troubleshoot most of these issues (with some patience) and, ultimately, the Galaxy Buds+ worked as expected more often than not.\nBut the issues were still frustrating and served as yet another reminder of why no company — Samsung included — has been able to match Apple's effortless pairing between AirPods and iPhones.\nImportantly, I didn't experience these issues when using the Galaxy Buds+ with my Google Pixel 3A or with Samsung's Galaxy Note 9. And, given the improvements to sound quality and battery life, I think the Galaxy Buds+ are a solid choice if you use an Android phone and want an untethered experience. But, no matter, I'm still not ditching my AirPods. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1209957%252Feeb7c9f2-b725-4dea-bad5-c0bc3e598f0f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=gnpdh6EU-9s2q5X02KKjxvC1feI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110700%252Fc128054b-8e61-4d95-892d-52eaae2c820d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=_MM2sk9Lw937LnQ4GSbbeWUFaIw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110700%252Fc128054b-8e61-4d95-892d-52eaae2c820d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=KMiO_Ecih7T9IHMg4Dp2t76dQVs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110700%252Fc128054b-8e61-4d95-892d-52eaae2c820d.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=pd90tl6HCB1PwcPIQGwNlYjkEjs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Review: Better sound and battery, but these are no AirPods Pro","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110700%252Fc128054b-8e61-4d95-892d-52eaae2c820d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=KMiO_Ecih7T9IHMg4Dp2t76dQVs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110700%252Fc128054b-8e61-4d95-892d-52eaae2c820d.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=kq2qcXq6m45UmCv_fWUNcN0VsU8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110700%252Fc128054b-8e61-4d95-892d-52eaae2c820d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=KMiO_Ecih7T9IHMg4Dp2t76dQVs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Review: Better sound and battery, but these are no AirPods Pro","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"productreview":[{"id":1199925,"data-id":1199925,"data-template":"default","data-product-url":"https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/headphones/galaxy-buds-plus-white-sm-r175nzwaxar/","data-product-price":149,"data-product-name":"Galaxy Buds+","data-product-good":"22-hour battery life,Noticeably better sound quality,Ambient mode is surprisingly good","data-product-bad":"Buggy pairing on iOS,Touch pads are too sensitive,Still uncomfortable for smaller ears","data-product-blurb":"Samsung's Galaxy Buds+ are a noticeable improvement from the original Galaxy Buds, but they won't make you ditch your AirPods.","data-product-score":"3.5","data-product-coolness":4,"data-product-curve":3,"data-product-performance":"3.5","data-product-value":"3.5","data-product-score-title":"⚡ Mashable Score","data-product-coolness-title":"😎 Cool Factor","data-product-curve-title":"📘Learning Curve","data-product-performance-title":"💪Performance","data-product-bang-for-the-buck-title":"💵Bang for the Buck","class":"content-productreview"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"An improvement on the original in important ways.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Review: Better sound and battery, but these are no AirPods Pro"},{"_id":"5e3006962463a37f4d00000d","id":"/article/emma-chamberlain-steeped-coffee-bags-review/","title":"Emma Chamberlain's steeped coffee bags are definitely expensive, but they might be worth it","title_tag":null,"author":"Chloe Bryan","post_date":"2020-01-28T10:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 10:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"01/28/2020","sort_key":"1IWnF6","link":"https://mashable.com/article/emma-chamberlain-steeped-coffee-bags-review/","content":{"plain":"When YouTube star Emma Chamberlain announced her coffee line, she got roasted almost immediately. The anger makes sense: Chamberlain has been criticized for overpriced merch before, and her “coffee bags” — tea bags containing coffee grounds for single-cup brewing — cost $60 for a pack of 30. \nThank god they make delicious coffee.\nChamberlain isn’t the first to dip her toe into coffee bags. In fact, Chamberlain Coffee is a collaboration with Steeped Coffee, which has been around since 2017. Nor is she the first influencer to release a coffee line. Remember Connor Franta’s coffee subscription service?\nIt makes particular sense, though, for Chamberlain to get into the coffee business. While not an incredibly unique trait, loving the stuff is a core part of her brand. Steeped Coffee is a natural fit, too. Chamberlain famously loves making cold brew at home, which the coffee bag facilitates well, and the company’s compostable packaging and environmentalist ethos feels very VSCO girl, an archetype Chamberlain played a huge role in popularizing. \nIn Chamberlain's video announcing the line, she is visibly, believably excited. “This is my baby,” she says to her followers. “You guys are really important people in my life, and in a sense, [Chamberlain Coffee] is our coffee bonding.”\n\nSo as far as product launches go, coffee is a perfect choice for Chamberlain. But her critics are right: This coffee is too expensive. \nIf you buy a 30-pack of Chamberlain Coffee bags, each cup you brew will effectively cost $2. That might save you a bit of cash if you stop at a coffee shop every day, sure, but for people who make coffee at home, using a bag every day is so expensive as to be out of the question. The move, probably, is to save Chamberlain Coffee for specific occasions where quick single-serve coffee is best — camping, for example, or mornings where you'll be late for work unless you brew on the go. Be like a cat with salami: Have little a Chamberlain Coffee, as a treat.\nSEE ALSO: The preferred methods of extreme Instagram lurkers\nThe packaging (which is very pretty) suggests placing each bag into a mug, pouring 8oz of hot water over it slowly, dunking the bag repeatedly for 15 seconds, then leaving it to steep for five minutes. Chamberlain says in her video, however, that she prefers a stronger cup, so she steeps for 10. This is also what I’d suggest, to the point that 10 minutes should probably be the minimum. \n         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by CHAMBERLAIN COFFEE (@chamberlaincoffee) on Dec 29, 2019 at 7:33pm PST\nI’d also suggest using a larger coffee cup than you usually do. While the bags are similar in shape to teabags, they are roughly twice their size and a little difficult to dunk without splashing hot water on yourself. Or maybe I have the dexterity of a two-year-old.\nDespite these quirks, the process is remarkably easy and straightforward. And the result is delicious — smooth, fruity, and mostly grit-free. It definitely doesn’t taste like instant coffee.\nThe bags also made great homemade cold brew. (Can you imagine if they didn't? A bad cold brew from a diehard fan like Chamberlain would be a bummer.) To make your cold brew Emma-style, place three bags into a large mason jar of ice water, cover it, then put it in the fridge overnight. Did you just pay $6 to make your own jar of cold brew? Yes, you did. But you probably knew what you were getting into anyway.\nIt's unlikely that Chamberlain launched this project assuming it would become the go-to beverage for coffee snobs who don't know who she is. It's far more likely than she — and her team — knew that its audience would be her millions of fans, who are interested in becoming part of Chamberlain's world through any means offered. Is this coffee a practical everyday grocery item? No, and it's not intended to be one. It's intended to be merch.\nSo those of you who aren't Chamberlain stans will want to skip this. Tip: A 30-pack of regular Steeped Coffee is $39.99 — still pricey but not as pricey — so pick that up if you're looking to give the coffee bag format a try. \nIf you know a die-hard Chamberlain fan, though, you know what to get them for their next birthday. Just be sure to grab a mason jar for them, too."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1168620%252Fe803e7ab-cdd5-410e-8095-7fd63ddacf83.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=hhiIldPNkPsoCK3IXcfGJ8A0R0w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109781%252Fd1df0b6d-b129-465f-bfcd-2b0bfed7d3dd.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=CBhuVkGXPVmk-AnE3Gn3DIcwrfw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109781%252Fd1df0b6d-b129-465f-bfcd-2b0bfed7d3dd.png%252F280x158.png?signature=u81CrR_dWIm0UjnTrkucV7uSqX8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109781%252Fd1df0b6d-b129-465f-bfcd-2b0bfed7d3dd.png%252F560x316.png?signature=z9vCK0tlEJfxuAQxRVdCIN14z-Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Emma Chamberlain's steeped coffee bags are definitely expensive, but they might be worth it","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109781%252Fd1df0b6d-b129-465f-bfcd-2b0bfed7d3dd.png%252F280x158.png?signature=u81CrR_dWIm0UjnTrkucV7uSqX8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109781%252Fd1df0b6d-b129-465f-bfcd-2b0bfed7d3dd.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=Q5h_KlQvE_eOqjqg7cLrW9wPQec=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109781%252Fd1df0b6d-b129-465f-bfcd-2b0bfed7d3dd.png%252F280x158.png?signature=u81CrR_dWIm0UjnTrkucV7uSqX8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Emma Chamberlain's steeped coffee bags are definitely expensive, but they might be worth it","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"productreview":[{"id":1168595,"data-id":1168595,"data-template":"default","data-product-url":"https://chamberlaincoffee.com/products/fresh-coffee-bags?variant=31396262969476","data-product-price":"10-60","data-product-name":"Chamberlain Steeped Coffee Bags","data-product-good":"Delicious, smooth coffee,Quick and simple brewing,Cute packaging","data-product-bad":"It is very expensive","data-product-blurb":"Emma Chamberlain's coffee line probably deserved the backlash about price.

That was the moment I allowed myself to utter the words aloud, \"What in the living fuck?\" \n\"I had an exorcism,\" Elise Loehnen, chief content officer at Goop, told CEO and founder Gwyneth Paltrow in a shiny, pastel room in Santa Monica. Loehnen did not have an exorcism, just to be clear. The Goop staff had been trying out \"energy healing,\" which involved Goop employees lying on massage tables while a man stood over them making puppeteer motions as they moved, jerked, and contorted their bodies. \n\"The technology isn't quite there yet to measure energy healing,\" an energy healing consultant tells Paltrow in her office. \"Just because something isn't proven doesn't mean it doesn't work.\" \nSEE ALSO: Misinformation about women's bodies thrives online. Meet the doctor fighting it.\nBut many scientists are skeptical.\nYou might already be familiar with Goop, Paltrow's controversial and heavily criticised lifestyle empire. Goop's fiercest critic, OB/GYN Dr. Jen Gunter, recently told Mashable she thinks Paltrow is \"the chief content officer for misinformation.\" The brand is best known for selling vaginal jade eggs (a very bad idea), for claiming that bras cause cancer (something that's been debunked many times by medical experts), and for advocating vaginal steaming (do not do this). The words \"pseudoscience\" and \"snake oil\" are frequently used in connection with the brand. \n\nWatching The Goop Lab will not allay any fears you might have about Goop's power to disseminate harmful myths about health. What it does do is offer a fascinating glimpse into the minds of the people behind this scientifically dubious operation. Each of the six 30-minute episodes delves into a different wellness topic including psychedelics therapy, cold therapy, psychics, female pleasure, energy healing, and anti-ageing. \nAs you progress through each episode, you witness Goop staff experimenting with magic mushrooms, jumping into freezing cold lakes, and talking to a psychic. You see Paltrow trying a \"vampire facial,\"a treatment which involves getting her own plasma injected into her face. Do not try this at home, folks. \nOne phrase you'll hear a few times: \"We have a lot of anecdotal evidence...\"\nOne phrase you'll hear a few times throughout the series is: \"We have a lot of anecdotal evidence....\" which you can make up your own mind about. You'll also notice a decent peppering of infomercial-like pieces to camera featuring people claiming that certain experimental therapies changed their lives. I'd skip through those parts, if I were you. \nMost surprising and enlightening of all, however, was the episode about female sexuality. It's fascinating that a woman who has attracted a great deal of criticism for selling products for women's vaginas does not, in fact, know the difference between a vulva and vagina. But that was the fact viewers are confronted with in the sexuality episode of The Goop Lab. \nVeteran sexologist Betty Dodson gave Paltrow a much-needed anatomy lesson and explained the difference between the vulva and vagina. “The vagina is only the birth canal?\" Paltrow asked, hearing the information for the first time. “See, I’m getting an anatomy lesson. I thought the vagina was the whole....\" But that wasn't the only thing Paltrow learned in the episode, also being enlightened as to what a \"PC\" is — cue Dodson, \"Your pelvic floor muscle. You’re sitting on it,\" — and then being horrified to hear about labiaplasty. Maybe someone should tell her about exactly where she's telling people to put the jade eggs...\n\n“We’re very dangerous when we’re knowledgable,” Dodson says to Paltrow near the end of the episode. “Tell me about it,” Paltrow replies with a knowing look. In this case, it’s the lack of knowledge about female anatomy that's dangerous, and honestly, pretty alarming for a brand selling wellness products and treatments.\nWatching The Goop Lab, I felt like a day visitor at a cult. \nAs you progress through this high-gloss, daytime TV-esque series you get a rare glimpse of the inner machinations of the Goop empire. You see how the millennial-pink Goop sausage gets made. The people behind the company's polished façade are warm, personable, but there's also a vulnerability to them. During each Goop Lab experiment, they unpack emotional baggage and trauma. It can be extremely upsetting to watch. In those moments, I wondered if Goop's employees were similar to its consumers: people who are looking for a 'cure' in a place they won't find it. And it's also easy to see the undeniable draw that Goop has. Paltrow is extremely likeable. I found myself wanting to believe her.  \nWatching The Goop Lab, I felt like a day visitor at a cult. I snapped out of the brainwashing experiment at the exact moment before it was too late to turn back. But Goop fan or skeptic, this show is very watchable. Just make sure you heed the repeated legal disclaimers throughout: \"The following series is deigned to entertain and inform — not provide medical advice.\"\nIn essence, eagerly consuming The Goop Lab is a bit like eating fast food — you know it's bad for you, but you just can't put it down.\nThe Goop Lab hits Netflix Jan. 24."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1154987%252F8e897790-4567-4da0-915c-a7129d4e231f.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=VbBrNDyvtlWEUdVZvqfAWbTSmho=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=RGdb8MvHnW626J6bFbpgLZcpwdU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=ykJ9NVonwkTFpSusvWLNV8Q3Zrs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=IsHlUpBI2u6ZmqbymfEcZ7PfWBE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Gwyneth Paltrow's 'The Goop Lab' is a glossy infomercial for woo-woo wellness","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=ykJ9NVonwkTFpSusvWLNV8Q3Zrs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=QNja1NDF-GB41uklTL7ArIKHqVU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=ykJ9NVonwkTFpSusvWLNV8Q3Zrs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Gwyneth Paltrow's 'The Goop Lab' is a glossy infomercial for woo-woo wellness","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It was the \"exorcism\" that got me.\n","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"Gwyneth Paltrow's 'The Goop Lab' is a glossy infomercial for woo-woo wellness"}]

It makes the film feel like a sped-up victory tour around the Star Wars galaxy, as the protagonists hop rapidly from one planet and conflict to the next, meeting new allies and worrying over past foes. The gasping pace doesn’t leave much time for contemplating plot holes, or noticing that the stakes feel lighter than ever, even though in theory, entire planets are on the line. It also doesn’t leave time for further character development, any form of nuance, or even a moment’s reflection on the passing of an age. \n\nJake Coyle, Associated Press\nThe movie can't sit still. Everyone’s yelling and most of the bits of humor along the way are too blandly inserted. (C-3PO, at least, is in fine form.) Part of the rush, it seems, is to dismantle some of Johnson’s groundwork and refocus the spine of the story on Rey’s destiny and her complicated relationship with Ren. \n\nEsther Zuckerman, Thrillist\nThere is little triumph in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Instead, the movie plays out like a confusing sequel to a film that doesn't exist. The bones of what made the new era of the saga exciting -- the talented, appealing actors, the charming practical effects and creatures -- are still there, but it's all mired in a plot that's as sludgy as planet Dagobah.\n\nThe Force is strong with Daisy Ridley's and Adam Driver's performances\nOwen Gleiberman, Variety\nThe Rise of Skywalker also features what is far and away Daisy Ridley’s most accomplished performance as Rey ... Ridley wears Rey’s mission with furious charisma, bringing a possessed quality to the character, never more so than when she learns who she is. What makes her performance so much more than “diversity” casting is that The Rise of Skywalker pointedly completes the Star Wars saga as a myth embracing the rise of women.\n\nA.O. Scott, The New York Times\nThe bond between Rey and Kylo felt both politically dangerous and sexually provocative, while Rey’s obscure origins suggested that the rebels might finally come to represent something more genuinely democratic than the enlightened wing of the galactic ruling class.\n\nNigel Andrews, Financial Times\nThe only actor in the final series who needs no wishing-on has been Adam Driver. He is its true star. As Kylo Ren, the dark prince, he is so sumptuously troubled, so multidimensionally moody, so craggily crypto-Shakespearean that we believe everything — even, in this new, last film, a moral journey so complex and counterintuitive that it out-switchbacks everyone.\n\nThere's plenty of fan service, for better or worse\nRichard Lawson, Vanity Fair\nThe Rise of Skywalker, feels like such a desperate scramble to win back fans’ affection, to re-create that probably uncapturable sense of awe conjured up by the original series. The movie never rests, relentlessly ardent in its grasping for mythos.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson, Vox\nThe Rise of Skywalker falls somewhere between an overstuffed fan-service finale and a yawnfest. If The Force Awakens kicked off a new cycle in the franchise and The Last Jedi set it up to push beyond its familiar patterns, The Rise of Skywalker for the most part runs screaming in the other direction.\n\nIan Sandwell, Digital Spy\nAs much as Abrams knows to deliver what the fans want, he's careful to add quieter moments into the mix too.\nIt's here where The Rise of Skywalker shines with emotional beats that fans won't forget, as well as crowd-pleasing payoffs that have been decades in the making. It's fan service, but done in service of the plot and not just thrown in for the sake of it.\n\nDarren Franich, Entertainment Weekly\nThe final act aims for tearjerkery with sincere appreciations of franchise lore. Don’t buy it. There’s always been a secret cynicism underpinning Abrams’ Star blockbusters, which adrenalize the pop-est culture of his youth and avoid anything requiring originality or imagination. Now he’s left grasping for source material he hasn’t already replicated — and one late montage even copies a sequence added into Return of the Jedi’s 1997 Special Edition. \n\nAt the very least, it looks bloody brilliant\nTodd McCarthy, The Hollywood Reporter\nFrom a physical production point of view, Skywalker is stupendous, enough reason by itself to see and even enjoy the film. Clearly no expense has been spared in making almost every scene spectacular, and cinematographer Dan Mindel has here surpassed his work on The Force Awakens and numerous other special effects extravaganzas with his often striking images.\n\nCarrie Fisher's appearance could have been better handled\nAdi Robertson, The Verge\nLeia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who could be the heart of the film, is ill-served by the snippets of footage that could be shot before Fisher’s death — consisting almost entirely of vague, contextless platitudes.\n\nDarren Franich, Entertainment Weekly\nI don’t really know how Fisher’s appearance was created. It looks like a very high-tech combination of unused footage, digital effects, and terrible writing. Her presence plus the Emperor’s shadowy appearance multiplied by other ghosts from the past equals yet another Disney-branded Star Wars looking ever backward, never forward.\n\nNewbies rule\nBrian Tuitt, USA Today\nRise of Skywalker expands its gloriously large galaxy with three fantastic debuts. Masked thief Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) is a reminder of Poe's shady past, and Russell and Isaac's chemistry pops, even with one of them in a helmet. Little alien handyman Babu Frick is about to steal some of Baby Yoda's adorable thunder. And horse-riding, arrow-shooting warrior Jannah (Naomi Ackie) shares common ground with Finn. Yet the audience gets barely enough of them to whet the appetite before the hyper, constantly shifting plot moves elsewhere.\n\nGermain Lussier, Gizmodo\nZorii Bliss (Keri Russell) and Jannah (Naomi Ackie) are both welcome, excellent additions and deserve way, way more screen time than they get. The same can be said for the super cute Babu Frik, who all but steals the movie, and new droid D-O, who is there only to cover a specific plot point but is adorable nonetheless.\n\nIt's an ending, but is it?\nSteve Rose, Guardian\nThe big questions get answered, but cannot be discussed further, for the time being. Let’s just say some old Star Wars traditions die hard. As do old Star Wars characters. There are so many returning old faces in this movie, you start to wonder if anyone ever actually dies and stays dead in this far-away galaxy. \n\nHelen O'Hara, Empire\nMaybe it won’t matter to fans. There are effective emotional punches before the end, as we say a final goodbye to Carrie Fisher and her generation of stars and as Kylo and Rey face their demons. Arguably the story more or less ends up in the right place, despite the threads left hanging."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108265%252F84f684bf-2a66-4b6a-b171-5cebcaa79d20.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=Yrwt_KAHlm7yzDNVaPvukT_kQCE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108265%252F84f684bf-2a66-4b6a-b171-5cebcaa79d20.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=HtAawCB-lHgm-MYf8FA-pw9i2BI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108265%252F84f684bf-2a66-4b6a-b171-5cebcaa79d20.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=5QQGKQ-bLW21QViinS9GzLWDVlA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108265%252F84f684bf-2a66-4b6a-b171-5cebcaa79d20.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=rtCtFSnSeZFG83AuIBm401gTVHc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108265%252F84f684bf-2a66-4b6a-b171-5cebcaa79d20.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=vezvRKeT5ZRJDkGHgD8E33Ig0zo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108265%252F84f684bf-2a66-4b6a-b171-5cebcaa79d20.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=z4WTK8IYctNTSohB_RuaVaay-FY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' reviews unpack a dizzying, high-paced finale","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108265%252F84f684bf-2a66-4b6a-b171-5cebcaa79d20.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=5QQGKQ-bLW21QViinS9GzLWDVlA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108265%252F84f684bf-2a66-4b6a-b171-5cebcaa79d20.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=vezvRKeT5ZRJDkGHgD8E33Ig0zo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108265%252F84f684bf-2a66-4b6a-b171-5cebcaa79d20.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=5QQGKQ-bLW21QViinS9GzLWDVlA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' reviews unpack a dizzying, high-paced finale","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"\"Some 'shippers will be frustrated as hell; others happy as clams.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' reviews unpack a dizzying, high-paced finale"},{"_id":"5dca831d9111ae083700003e","id":"/review/spectacles-3-review/","title":"Spectacles 3 review: Snapchat's most advanced glasses feel too much like an experiment","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2019-11-12T10:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 10:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"11/12/2019","sort_key":"1IusXS","link":"https://mashable.com/review/spectacles-3-review/","content":{"plain":"There's no question: Snap's third-generation Spectacles are the company's most advanced yet. That's not necessarily saying a ton, considering last year's Spectacles 2 didn't add many new capabilities, but if you love Snapchat and you're excited about augmented reality tech, Spectacles 3 open up some pretty cool possibilities. \nThe bad news is that many of these advancements still feel experimental at best. And $380 feels like too steep a price to pay for an experiment.\nA toy no more\nSpectacles 3 is the first big redesign for Snap's camera glasses. While the first two generations featured an all-plastic design that looked more like toys, the company clearly tried for a different kind of look. \nThe neon yellow case has been replaced with black leather, and the glasses are now made of steel instead of plastic. The result of this is a set of frames that are meant to be sleeker and more fashion forward, though I preferred the previous generation's style. \n\nAt the same time, the cameras feel more obvious than ever. The lenses are no longer flush with the sides of the frames, so both lenses stick out noticeably, though the glasses are a bit slimmer overall.\nLike previous versions, Spectacles 3 charge in the case, which can provide a few additional charges. The case, which now folds flat, charges with USB instead of the proprietary magnetic connector Snap used in years past.\n\nSpectacles 3 are also no longer waterproof, which is kind of a bummer. While Spectacles 2 never became my everyday glasses, the fact that they were waterproof made them a fun addition to my beach bag, since it mean I could take photos without worrying about my phone. \nSnapping in 3D\nHowever you feel about their design, the main appeal of Spectacles 3 is the cameras. The new dual-camera setup means that Spectacles 3 can now capture depth data. In practice, this means you can shoot 3D photos or add a new type of 3D augmented reality effect to your videos.\nAt first, it seems like a subtle change compared with older versions of Spectacles. You still use physical shutter buttons to either snap a video (a single tap records a 10-second video) or take a photo (hold down on the button for a single image). \n\nIt's when you import your photos and videos back into the Snapchat app that you really get a feel for what Spectacles 3 can do. Still images can be rendered as 3D photos, similar to what Facebook did with portrait mode photos last year. \n\nSnapchat is also introducing a new type of AR effect, 3D lenses, which can map to the contents of your photos or videos. So AR balloons will \"pop\" on objects in the frame, or neon arches will spring out of the sidewalk as you walk down the street. While all this is the result of a fair bit of impressive engineering, I'm not sure most people will be able to distinguish these new 3D effects from Snap's other extensive AR lenses. \n\nAnd though I had some fun experimenting with these new effects, it all still feels very much like a work in progress. The Snapchat app was often extremely slow to load 3D effects in the app, even when I was on very fast Wi-Fi, and video quality was inconsistent. Some videos were sharp and clear, while other appeared a bit distorted. One video seemed to experience some kind of glitch that briefly inverted all the colors for no apparent reason. \nYou can see one of the glitchy videos in the clip below.\n\nAnd while I can forgive some early bugs, those issues aren't the main reason why I have trouble recommending Spectacles 3. \nMy main issue is that I've been using Spectacles 3 for a week now and I'm still not really sure who this product is for. While previous versions were basically a glorified Snapchat camera you could wear, the price point (at $129 and $149) at least sort of made sense. They weren't for everyone, but it was easy to see why the most dedicated Snapchat users would be excited for them. \nI can't say the same for Spectacles 3. At $380, they're prohibitively expensive for most of Snapchat's core demographic. And though the the 3D capabilities have some promise, it doesn't yet feel fully baked. \nAt a time when speculation about augmented reality glasses is rampant, Spectacles does feel like an important step toward something. I'm just not quite sure what."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1076242%252F5ea65e11-faa1-4641-9e36-d0ae71adc385.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=EqZnw302UREdJ-E6M7RqeupIIbs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106195%252Fe813ef94-56da-4dad-b1bf-dd5a913f99a7.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=wMmM_p7OyAb5lsymGELT3_PCKHo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106195%252Fe813ef94-56da-4dad-b1bf-dd5a913f99a7.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=IpaPBDVIHpqNi_CeS9driDoxKVQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106195%252Fe813ef94-56da-4dad-b1bf-dd5a913f99a7.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=P50TtXXjYsjhJXxh4ev2oa3naag=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

houseplants, which have always arrived at my door healthy, safe, and well-packaged. Now for those of us who struggle to keep even a snake plant alive, the company has dipped a toe into fake and preserved plants, too.\nThe collection includes 14 fake plants and 3 preserved plants, which range in price from $75 (three faux Monstera leaves) to $940 (a 40\" by 18\" living wall). Among them are several plants that are infamously hard to maintain, like ficus trees and fiddle-leaf figs. If you lack either the light or the skill set to care for the real versions of these bad boys, now's your chance to enjoy their look without having to mourn their inevitable death.\nThe Sill sent me two products for this story: a faux angel wings begonia and a preserved fern kokedama. In classic Sill form, the begonia (be-faux-nia?) was wrapped carefully in bubble wrap and and placed inside a cardboard carton to maintain its shape inside the box. The kokedama shipped from a separate vendor, Artisan Moss, but it was still painstakingly bubble-wrapped. Both arrived in good shape, with no visible nicks or tears.\nThe faux plant\nFirst, the begonia. As The Sill points out on its product page, real angel wings begonias can be finicky, especially if your home doesn't have consistent bright light. They're also poisonous to pets, so there's a real market for a faux option. Luckily, this particular fake begonia does indeed look like a real begonia, with long, winglike leaves and bright, painted-on spots. It also comes in one of The Sill's trendy ceramic planters, which adds to its aesthetic appeal.\n\nThat said, this plant is still a fake plant. The Sill hasn't reinvented what a fake plant looks like here; the leaves don't gleam like real leaves and the stems are visibly, obviously plastic. The big aesthetic issue, one The Sill might have been able to avoid, is that the faux plant, which is attached to a big chunk of faux dirt, doesn't quite fit in the planter — there's a big ring of space around the perimeter, which means the plant sits a little crookedly. \nSEE ALSO: It's okay to have fake plants\nAt $82 — not cheap! — a lot of what you're paying for here is the planter. If you can swing it, you might be better off buying one of The Sill's real plants, most of which are cheaper. But for the pet owners and black thumbs out there, the faux begonia is a fine option.\nThe preserved plant\nKokedama, which literally means \"moss ball,\" is a Japanese art form in which a small plant (in this case, a fern) is grown on a moss-covered ball of soil. The Sill's fern kokedama is preserved, so you don't need to mist it like you would a living version. \nAs The Sill warns on its website, the kokedama had a slightly musty smell right out of the box — nothing unpleasant, but definitely noticeable. After a week, it had mostly dissipated, but if it had hung around for a while longer I don't think I would've cared.\n\nI hung my kokedama in my living room. (It comes ready to hang, which is convenient.) So far it has enjoyed a mostly incident-free existence. It did shed a bit during the first few days, which I chalk up to the moss getting loosened a bit during the shipping process, but otherwise looks great. The moss ball is a slightly yellower shade of green than the fern, but a small difference in color is standard for the genre.\nThe preserved fern costs $75, which is definitely an investment. You're paying for craftsmanship here, though it's worth noting that Artisan Moss (The Sill's vendor) sells preserved pine fern and grassy fern kokedama for just $57 a pop, as well as a bear grass version for $67.50. You simply have to buy them through Artisan Moss's website instead.\nSo, are they worth it?\nBoth products are pretty expensive, though it's easier to justify the price of the kokedama than that of the faux begonia. \nLiving kokedama can be difficult to keep healthy, and the preserved version provides the exact same look with no upkeep necessary. The begonia, on the other hand, is just a regular faux plant in a beautiful planter. In the right home, it'll certainly provide some decorative flexibility — you won't have to worry about placing it near a window or out of reach of your cat, for example — but there are more affordable faux plants out there. \nAnd if you can swing a regular begonia, even better.

price","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2019-11-06T11:43:14+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 06 Nov 2019 11:43:14 +0000","formatted_date":"11/06/2019","sort_key":"1IsjIu","link":"https://mashable.com/review/beats-solo-pro-review/","content":{"plain":"It's been more than three years since Beats last updated the Solo line and in that time the on-ear headphones have become the brand's most popular product, with more than 30 million pairs sold. \nSo it's understandable, then, that with Beats Solo Pro, the latest update to the Solo lineup, Beats would try to deliver more than just an iterative upgrade. In that sense, Solo Pro live up to the promise. \nThe headphones have been completely redesigned, with a new band and bigger, cushier ear cushions that are designed for minimal sound leakage and better noise cancellation. The on-ear design will still look familiar to anyone who has seen and used Solo 3, but they definitely look sleeker, and more like a \"pro\" product. \nThe downside? The same qualities that make for great noise cancellation also make for an uncomfortable fit that's impossible to ignore. But, if an extra tight fit isn't a dealbreaker for you, then there's a ton to like about Solo Pro. \nBeats goes \"Pro\"\nThe first thing you notice about Solo Pro is that they look much nicer than previous headphones in the Solo line. They still sport the same on-ear design, but they look and feel more like the high-end headphones you'd expect with a $300 price tag. \n\nThe ear cushions are thicker and the headband is no longer entirely shiny plastic. The ear cups connect to the band with an aluminum slider, which makes it a bit easier to adjust the fit, and gives the headphones a much more elevated look overall. The band itself is still plastic, but all of the headphones have a more matte finish (Beats is also introducing three new \"more matte\" colors with Solo Pro: red, dark blue, and light blue.)\nThe controls have also changed up quite a bit. Beat Solo Pro come with a lightning port for charging, but there's no 3.5mm headphone jack. Given the fact that Apple hasn't made an iPhone with a headphone jack in more than three years, a move that most other phone manufactures have since copied, it's understandable Beats would opt for a wireless-first approach. \nAnd Apple does sell a $35 lightning to 3.5mm audio cable for those who want a wired connection. But it's still kind of a bummer that almost-$300 headphones don't come with an audio cable included — especially considering one of the main places people tend to use noise cancelling headphones is on airplanes, which usually require a 3.5mm cable for in-flight entertainment systems. Sigh. \n\nThat aside, other changes are definitely for the better. There's no longer a dedicated power switch — instead you simply fold and unfold the headphones to turn them on and off. Playback controls are built into the right ear cup: Tap on the top to bottom to adjust volume, the sides to skip forward and back, and the center to play or pause. \nThere's also a new button on the bottom of the left ear, which you use to switch between noise cancellation and \"transparency\" mode, which allows you to hear ambient noise from your surroundings. (You can also adjust these settings with Control Center on an iOS device, like you can with AirPods Pro.)\nAnd Beats still blows AirPods out of the water when it comes to battery life. Some people might be disappointed that Solo Pro only get about 22 hours of battery when noise cancellation is enabled (when it's disables, they'll get the same 40 hours as Solo 3), but I think 22 hours is more than enough. That will easily get you through even the longest of long-haul flights and then some. \nGreat sound, with a catch\nThe upgrades also carry over to how Beats Solo Pro sound. While there was once a time when Beats was criticized for over-emphasizing bass, Solo Pro have a clear, balanced sound regardless of genre. \nI've spent several hours listening to everything from EDM to podcasts, and the sound has been consistently good, regardless of whether noise cancellation is enabled. That said, noise cancellation definitely enhances the experience. I found that my Solo Pro headphones were much better at blocking out background noise like office chatter than AirPods Pro. Conversely, \"transparency mode\" was much more effective with AirPods Pro — neither of which is particularly surprising considering Solo Pro cover your entire ear.\nUnfortunately, the improved sound and noise cancellation come with a major hitch: comfort.\nThe biggest drawback of the new Beats, though, is something that's more difficult to overlook. While the redesigned ear cushions feel comfy when you first put the headphones on, that quickly degrades the longer you wear them.\n\nBecause the one-ear headphones were designed for optimal noise cancellation, which requires a tight seal around your ears, this also means they are just too tight for extended use. \nThroughout my testing, I consistently had to take them off after about two hours because they simply put too much pressure on my head and ears. After a couple hours, they created weird pressure points on the sides of my ears that became downright painful if I didn't take them off. I experimented with fit and even tried stretching them out a bit and, though this helped a bit, I still always felt the squeeze.\nI have very small ears and sometimes have issues with fit with many different types of headphones, so I asked a colleague to wear them for awhile and share his thoughts. He had a similar complaint: after two hours they became uncomfortable due to the pressure on top of his head. \nI realize this might not be the case for everyone. I've never found AirPods uncomfortable, for example, but I know many people do. Likewise, some might not have an issue with the feel of Beats Solo Pro (other reviewers seem to have mixed opinions about comfort). Depending on the shape of your head and your ears, what's too tight for me might be just fine for you. \nSo, definitely try before you buy. But if you're a Beats fan looking to upgrade, the addition of noise cancellation alone could make the upgrade worth it. Just make sure you like the way they fit."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1073117%252F4e9e3220-a939-4f82-9b6d-b82771ac27f1.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=uMrRst9_QH80Ta_5Eg2ltjC9O4M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105142%252Fa671bc1f-1c2b-40a0-a43f-beabfe73a132.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=Es75lp_lWh3CU6dJWm4reR5u6cU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105142%252Fa671bc1f-1c2b-40a0-a43f-beabfe73a132.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=PadRF6H6iCZ8hTBXygf8ytYXz1U=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105142%252Fa671bc1f-1c2b-40a0-a43f-beabfe73a132.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=M_SE7INVfsSTytewlHC-zA7NyYI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

Is Born, or listened to a Phoebe Bridgers song knows that truly good makeup holds up through a monsoon of violent tears. They'll also appreciate this dataset created by programmer, artist, and student Connie Ye, which identifies references to crying in Sephora reviews to point you to the weep-proof products you want. \nThe dataset lives on one of Ye's websites, where users can refresh repeatedly to see dozens of makeup reviews that mention crying, sobbing, or tears. Reading them is a frequently funny and occasionally poignant experience: Some share an affecting amount of personal detail, making them read more like digital-age flash fiction than opinions about products. In fact, product names and usernames aren't visible on Ye's site, so that's pretty much what they are.\nI made a dataset of Sephora reviews that mention crying ☔️ https://t.co/BNObniWmOM pic.twitter.com/IFYwnqKKf0— connie (@crabbage_) November 3, 2019\n\n\"One day I was crying mad hard because there's too many f boys in my life,\" wrote one reviewer. \"Guess what? My liner was still slaying and cutting people.\"\n\"One day my ex made me cry and a couple of minutes later he noticed that all my eye makeup was still perfect,\" wrote another. \"That's when I realized how good this stuff is. And that I should never speak to my ex again.\"\nYet another reviewer describes their experience wearing an eyeliner through a full day of military deployment:\nWent and ran 4 miles on a treadmill in 85 deg 100% humidity gym. I sweat like a horse by the way. Then the rowing machine for 1/2 hr in a space that can only be described as a steam oven. Then back in my room, I started feeling bad about the email I got earlier from my guy-finally accepting it's not what I thought it was--and had a really good cry. I looked in the mirror after all this and my eyeliner was perfect. You decide.\nYe explained over Twitter DM that she got the idea for the project while taking a class about creating art from data. (The class is taught by Everest Pipkin, a visiting faculty member at Carnegie Mellon.) \nSEE ALSO: Cult skincare brand Sunday Riley settles with FTC over fake Sephora reviews\n\"Something [Pipkin] mentioned that I was thinking about a lot was that when we make smaller datasets, we have the chance to draw from places that matter to us personally,\" she explained. \"And I had spent a lot of time in high school reading Sephora reviews because the products are really expensive and I wanted to make sure I wasn’t wasting my money.\"\n\nYe scraped a total of 5018 reviews from 13 products, which she chose mostly by perusing Sephora's eye product pages under the \"waterproof\" filter. 105 of those reviews included one of her crying-related keywords.\nYe chose which products to scrape reviews from mostly by perusing Sephora's eye product pages under the \"waterproof\" filter. \"They were just the best [sellers] for the most part, but I tried to have some variety in brand,\" she said. \"I also tried other products like primer and setting spray, but the only one that paid off for those was the setting spray.\" She found that most pulled reviews that mentioned crying were for either mascara or eyeliner; however, primer and setting spray also made appearances.\nFeeling deeply and abidingly moved is all well and good, but after reading a few glowing testimonials you'll probably want to learn what these products actually are. Lucky you: Ye has also published the project's raw data, which reveals that, among other products, Kat Von D's Tattoo eyeliner and Too Faced's Better Than Sex mascara are especially effective in the face of tears. The latter makes particular sense: Crying is absolutely better than sex."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1073047%252F3a300d0b-3724-45ae-9f4f-009d86e159b2.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=gZBFG3nP_fIhyCHSAQxssH638aQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105746%252F8cb4031f-3cc9-4c6c-9f1e-c1b7f308ee88.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=CSz2R-2RVRzpEj9Ms5JtAWwmr84=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105746%252F8cb4031f-3cc9-4c6c-9f1e-c1b7f308ee88.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=z2Ax1DPVR0diEyqRszeQuHRH56A=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105746%252F8cb4031f-3cc9-4c6c-9f1e-c1b7f308ee88.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=ttcT1G3tZLUPI1jliSeO92RSh28=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105746%252F8cb4031f-3cc9-4c6c-9f1e-c1b7f308ee88.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=hoq0dNj6pZenaoc_SQ8JOab0t_s=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105746%252F8cb4031f-3cc9-4c6c-9f1e-c1b7f308ee88.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=ptILz5RT6k_E2QapH7_pkIDVUCw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1073047%252F3a300d0b-3724-45ae-9f4f-009d86e159b2.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1073047%252F3a300d0b-3724-45ae-9f4f-009d86e159b2.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1073047%252F3a300d0b-3724-45ae-9f4f-009d86e159b2.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=5C_NwfnP8ibLDHLd2r-LYp6oimI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1073047%252F3a300d0b-3724-45ae-9f4f-009d86e159b2.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=KoK8Fr63ON38DNgeyk3T85iXAXY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Shutterstock / VGstockstudio"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Extremely useful website will show you Sephora reviews that mention crying","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Find out which mascaras and eyeliners can withstand your tears.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Extremely useful website will show you Sephora reviews that mention crying"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":1356}

That's the one thing we all have in common. \nIt's also the electric current running through Feel Good, a powerful new comedy written and created Mae Martin and Joe Hampson for Channel 4 and Netflix. \nFeel Good is hitting our screens at a time when we need it the most. That's not just because we're all massively in need of new shows to watch as we practice social distancing. It's because this is a programme about love, and all the complicated ways we behave in our quest to find another human who wants to be with us forever. \nMae Martin plays Mae, a rising star in comedy who falls in love with George, a woman who's previously only dated men. We later learn that this dynamic is something of a pattern for Mae, who has a history of dating women who — up 'til meeting her — identify as straight. \nThings between Mae and George (Charlotte Ritchie) are going pretty swimmingly for a while — that is, until they run into hot water. George won't come out to her friends and family, and ends up making up an imaginary boyfriend called Jonathan Crenshaw so all her friends will stop asking questions. But the fact that George won't introduce Mae to any of her friendship group leaves Mae feeling distinctly stashed away and insecure. \n\nWhile Mae's insecurities skyrocket, George lets slip a sentence during sex that definitely doesn't assuage Mae's anxieties: \"Come inside me.\" Mae responds, \"You just said 'come inside me' and I physically can't.\" Mae has something that I — and many others — can surely relate to. That something is a masochistic propensity to want what you cannot have. To chase after something or, crucially, someone who cannot love you. It makes for tortured, but highly resonant viewing.\nIn many ways, this show is about people's personal histories meeting their present day stories. Mae struggles to shake off the guilt she feels about her behaviour when she was an addict. That past hits her present head-on, however, when she relapses. For George, the looming shadow of her dating history is ever-present. George is coming to terms with her sexuality, while Mae frets that she'll never live up to the men George has previously dated. \nSEE ALSO: Romance, toxic relationships, and addiction drive trailer for comedy series 'Feel Good'\nWhen Mae's parents fly from Canada to the UK to scatter the ashes of their beloved cat on Blackpool beach (yes, I realise that's a lot to take in), the shit really hits the proverbial fan. Lisa Kudrow plays Linda, Mae's truculent diva of a mother — to great comic effect. I certainly never expected to witness Kudrow chomping on a Scotch egg in Blackpool, England, but it works. Like Mae, Linda is a complicated woman. She doesn't want to hear her daughter's apology and adopts evasive tactics to try to steer the conversation elsewhere. \n\nAs you watch Feel Good, the emotive writing really shines through. George's line \"Mae you have so many feelings but it's your head\" couldn't be more true. Martin and Hampson have created something that speaks to some pretty universal feelings — yearning to be loved and wanting something that is out of reach. \"I've been with good people, really good people, people who love me, and I lie next to them and I just feel so restless,\" says Mae as she lies next to George. \"And then when I lie next to you, I feel still, and quiet deep inside.\"\nThat said, it's not all deep feelings. Along Mae's journey, you'll meet some truly bonkers characters. Like her NA sponsor Maggie (Sophie Thompson) who has a daughter called Lava (named after the volcanic kind). You'll meet Phil (Phil Burgers), Mae's strange housemate, who gifts George a bucket of worms to cheer her up. And there's even a douchey manspreader who utters the line, \"I'm actually a pretty woke guy. I loved Call Me By Your Name.\"\nFeel Good made me feel things. Sitting in my flat on Day 3 of Not Going Outside, I watched all six episodes and wept. I needed to feel something other than anxiety, and Feel Good helped me to do it.  \nFeel Good is available to watch now on Channel 4 and Netflix. \n\n "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1250020%252F44fc27e8-8b10-48ea-b815-4a24bb843a20.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Re7Q_Bt3Gfpe2EA4nxdxtN1lrOw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=h93NU7C0UL7PYfklUFobciUnO9U=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F356x205.png?signature=lZUWedfpy9WDdfjAIx5OoeXk2IM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F712x410.png?signature=0OOUeMoho30Rz11tALEBxruTQl0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F280x157.png?signature=NUODDsXoK0LvJekn9JmLtPu5TVQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F560x314.png?signature=mQMOrX3EGtTFZ--xQa4HC5ctfRw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"'Feel Good' brings the complex rom-com energy you need in your life right now","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F356x205.png?signature=lZUWedfpy9WDdfjAIx5OoeXk2IM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=aXDXrvwApZlikkGuKJa11E6MJnw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=t_NmKgCYT6yQZ9ywC0DPS-AJxjk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F280x157.png?signature=NUODDsXoK0LvJekn9JmLtPu5TVQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112138%252Fcd88ac15-2218-46fe-96e4-fc809ea8f95d.png%252F356x205.png?signature=lZUWedfpy9WDdfjAIx5OoeXk2IM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"'Feel Good' brings the complex rom-com energy you need in your life right now","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Mae Martin's new show will make you feel things.

And, at $149, the Galaxy Buds+ are certainly priced to undercut Apple. \nBut after using the Galaxy Buds+ for more than a week, I'm left with an impression similar to last year's first-generation Galaxy Buds: There's a lot to like, especially if you use a Samsung phone. But these are no AirPods Pro replacement and iPhone owners might be disappointed if they're expecting the same level of quality as Apple's high-end AirPods. \nSame buds, (a few) new tricks\nThe Galaxy Buds+ look almost identical to last year's Galaxy Buds and come in the same pill-shaped charging case. It's a little bigger than the AirPods Pro charging case, but not by much —it still slips easily into just about any pocket.\nThe buds themselves are also unchanged from last year's design. They come with the same swappable tips and each bud has a small touchpad that lets you control music playback and sound settings. \n\nAs I wrote in my review last year, I have tiny ears, so thicker buds, like the Galaxy Buds, are almost always uncomfortable after extended use. That's still true with the Galaxy Buds+. But, again, I expect this won't be an issue for most people.\nI also still don't love the design of the touchpad, which I almost always unintentionally press when taking the Galaxy Buds+ in and out of my ears. After a solid of week of use, I managed to figure out a technique where I gingerly pluck each bud out of my ears without accidentally pressing the touchpad. But putting them in without pressing it is still a challenge.  \nWhile they may look the same as last year's buds, the biggest are upgrades with the Galaxy Buds+ are the things you can't see. Battery life, for example, now tops out at 22 hours — 11 hours for the buds and the charging case, respectively — which is a major improvement from last year's version which maxed out at 13 hours of total playback time.\n\nSamsung also did away with one of my biggest complaints with last year's buds: You no longer need two separate apps and a Samsung account in order to get that \"seamless\" AirPods-like pairing experience (assuming you have a compatible Samsung phone). Instead, you now need just a single Android app, Galaxy Wearable. But if you use a non-Samsung Android phone, you might also need the Galaxy Buds+ \"plugin,\" which requires a separate download. It's not exactly seamless, but at least it doesn't require you to use Samsung's Smart Things app which, honestly, no one should ever have to use.\nThe company also made some upgrades to the sound quality, adding additional microphones and improved drivers. It's a noticeable difference, but not hugely so. Music still sounds pretty good — just not great, which is to be expected with wireless earbuds. They don't sound as good as my AirPods Pro, but maybe a bit better than my first-gen AirPods. And while they don't have the same noise canceling abilities as AirPods Pro, the sound isolation is definitely better than most. \nThe difference was even more noticeable in ambient mode. While I found ambient mode in last year's Galaxy Buds to be pretty weak, ambient mode with the Galaxy Buds+ actually makes a big difference. With ambient mode on the lowest setting I was more than able to hear noise from my surroundings in addition to my music. \niPhone-friendly... mostly\nThe most intriguing change Samsung made is the addition of an iOS app which makes the Galaxy Buds+ officially iPhone-compatible... sort of. (The original Galaxy Buds can technically pair to iPhones, but without the accompanying app, your functionality is extremely limited.) \nI did however have a couple of issues while using the Galaxy Buds+ with my iPhone that make me hesitant to recommend them to iPhone users. While pairing to iOS is meant to be relatively painless thanks to the dedicated app, I found it to be a  slightly more complicated process than Samsung let on.\n\nFor one, you need to pair them in your main Bluetooth settings before you attempt to pair them in the app. If you pair using the app and then in your Bluetooth settings, the buds will connect, but might not actually play any sound. I also found, bizarrely, that my buds often paired as two separate devices and that I needed to connect to both devices in order for them to work.\nAdditionally, I encountered another issue that made it very difficult to take phone calls with the Galaxy Buds+. For some reason, every time I answered a call, the audio would switch back to my iPhone speaker and I had to manually change the source in order to hear the call through the buds. The phone wasn't losing the Bluetooth connection, it just wouldn't use it as the default for incoming phone calls. \nA Samsung representative told me these issues were likely unique to my specific pair of Galaxy Buds+, but I was unfortunately unable to confirm that. In any case, I was able to troubleshoot most of these issues (with some patience) and, ultimately, the Galaxy Buds+ worked as expected more often than not.\nBut the issues were still frustrating and served as yet another reminder of why no company — Samsung included — has been able to match Apple's effortless pairing between AirPods and iPhones.\nImportantly, I didn't experience these issues when using the Galaxy Buds+ with my Google Pixel 3A or with Samsung's Galaxy Note 9. And, given the improvements to sound quality and battery life, I think the Galaxy Buds+ are a solid choice if you use an Android phone and want an untethered experience. But, no matter, I'm still not ditching my AirPods. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1209957%252Feeb7c9f2-b725-4dea-bad5-c0bc3e598f0f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=gnpdh6EU-9s2q5X02KKjxvC1feI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110700%252Fc128054b-8e61-4d95-892d-52eaae2c820d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=_MM2sk9Lw937LnQ4GSbbeWUFaIw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110700%252Fc128054b-8e61-4d95-892d-52eaae2c820d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=EovHxA6oOKNr_pp_a46MVe4trAM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110700%252Fc128054b-8e61-4d95-892d-52eaae2c820d.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=SFROGKy_FboYrpTz4gnbrAiONyY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

the moment my chin hit my chest watching Netflix's The Goop Lab — a six-part series about the cult wellness brand that's so woo-woo and batshit, it's genuinely quite entertaining. That was the moment I allowed myself to utter the words aloud, \"What in the living fuck?\" \n\"I had an exorcism,\" Elise Loehnen, chief content officer at Goop, told CEO and founder Gwyneth Paltrow in a shiny, pastel room in Santa Monica. Loehnen did not have an exorcism, just to be clear. The Goop staff had been trying out \"energy healing,\" which involved Goop employees lying on massage tables while a man stood over them making puppeteer motions as they moved, jerked, and contorted their bodies. \n\"The technology isn't quite there yet to measure energy healing,\" an energy healing consultant tells Paltrow in her office. \"Just because something isn't proven doesn't mean it doesn't work.\" \nSEE ALSO: Misinformation about women's bodies thrives online. Meet the doctor fighting it.\nBut many scientists are skeptical.\nYou might already be familiar with Goop, Paltrow's controversial and heavily criticised lifestyle empire. Goop's fiercest critic, OB/GYN Dr. Jen Gunter, recently told Mashable she thinks Paltrow is \"the chief content officer for misinformation.\" The brand is best known for selling vaginal jade eggs (a very bad idea), for claiming that bras cause cancer (something that's been debunked many times by medical experts), and for advocating vaginal steaming (do not do this). The words \"pseudoscience\" and \"snake oil\" are frequently used in connection with the brand. \n\nWatching The Goop Lab will not allay any fears you might have about Goop's power to disseminate harmful myths about health. What it does do is offer a fascinating glimpse into the minds of the people behind this scientifically dubious operation. Each of the six 30-minute episodes delves into a different wellness topic including psychedelics therapy, cold therapy, psychics, female pleasure, energy healing, and anti-ageing. \nAs you progress through each episode, you witness Goop staff experimenting with magic mushrooms, jumping into freezing cold lakes, and talking to a psychic. You see Paltrow trying a \"vampire facial,\"a treatment which involves getting her own plasma injected into her face. Do not try this at home, folks. \nOne phrase you'll hear a few times: \"We have a lot of anecdotal evidence...\"\nOne phrase you'll hear a few times throughout the series is: \"We have a lot of anecdotal evidence....\" which you can make up your own mind about. You'll also notice a decent peppering of infomercial-like pieces to camera featuring people claiming that certain experimental therapies changed their lives. I'd skip through those parts, if I were you. \nMost surprising and enlightening of all, however, was the episode about female sexuality. It's fascinating that a woman who has attracted a great deal of criticism for selling products for women's vaginas does not, in fact, know the difference between a vulva and vagina. But that was the fact viewers are confronted with in the sexuality episode of The Goop Lab. \nVeteran sexologist Betty Dodson gave Paltrow a much-needed anatomy lesson and explained the difference between the vulva and vagina. “The vagina is only the birth canal?\" Paltrow asked, hearing the information for the first time. “See, I’m getting an anatomy lesson. I thought the vagina was the whole....\" But that wasn't the only thing Paltrow learned in the episode, also being enlightened as to what a \"PC\" is — cue Dodson, \"Your pelvic floor muscle. You’re sitting on it,\" — and then being horrified to hear about labiaplasty. Maybe someone should tell her about exactly where she's telling people to put the jade eggs...\n\n“We’re very dangerous when we’re knowledgable,” Dodson says to Paltrow near the end of the episode. “Tell me about it,” Paltrow replies with a knowing look. In this case, it’s the lack of knowledge about female anatomy that's dangerous, and honestly, pretty alarming for a brand selling wellness products and treatments.\nWatching The Goop Lab, I felt like a day visitor at a cult. \nAs you progress through this high-gloss, daytime TV-esque series you get a rare glimpse of the inner machinations of the Goop empire. You see how the millennial-pink Goop sausage gets made. The people behind the company's polished façade are warm, personable, but there's also a vulnerability to them. During each Goop Lab experiment, they unpack emotional baggage and trauma. It can be extremely upsetting to watch. In those moments, I wondered if Goop's employees were similar to its consumers: people who are looking for a 'cure' in a place they won't find it. And it's also easy to see the undeniable draw that Goop has. Paltrow is extremely likeable. I found myself wanting to believe her.  \nWatching The Goop Lab, I felt like a day visitor at a cult. I snapped out of the brainwashing experiment at the exact moment before it was too late to turn back. But Goop fan or skeptic, this show is very watchable. Just make sure you heed the repeated legal disclaimers throughout: \"The following series is deigned to entertain and inform — not provide medical advice.\"\nIn essence, eagerly consuming The Goop Lab is a bit like eating fast food — you know it's bad for you, but you just can't put it down.\nThe Goop Lab hits Netflix Jan. 24."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1154987%252F8e897790-4567-4da0-915c-a7129d4e231f.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=VbBrNDyvtlWEUdVZvqfAWbTSmho=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=RGdb8MvHnW626J6bFbpgLZcpwdU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=QaMzC-jZkyCdob1isApnmBtPzAw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=M_2E5eAU8atyx7NOrA7qs4Dgtz4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=GTHtKzcCLW914qFgfKYgd-r4Gw0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=-VN_BQkOXDv7wdS0bdWQ1KtYU-Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Gwyneth Paltrow's 'The Goop Lab' is a glossy infomercial for woo-woo wellness","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=QaMzC-jZkyCdob1isApnmBtPzAw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=uUTMZPD-tVC9Syw0FBkZwQ9w2ck=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=6wzBCbQl2G71TeuXbh35EgznLF0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=GTHtKzcCLW914qFgfKYgd-r4Gw0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109364%252F13f7659e-809d-47f8-abd2-b00bf510442a.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=QaMzC-jZkyCdob1isApnmBtPzAw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Gwyneth Paltrow's 'The Goop Lab' is a glossy infomercial for woo-woo wellness","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It was the \"exorcism\" that got me.\n","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Entertainment/","tweet_text":"Gwyneth Paltrow's 'The Goop Lab' is a glossy infomercial for woo-woo wellness"},{"_id":"5dbae6e7ca2f0c21d800006c","id":"/review/airpods-pro-review/","title":"AirPods Pro review: Better in every way","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2019-10-31T13:51:33+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 13:51:33 +0000","formatted_date":"10/31/2019","sort_key":"1IqcQR","link":"https://mashable.com/review/airpods-pro-review/","content":{"plain":"It's been three years since Apple launched its first AirPods. In that time, the plastic wireless earbuds have gone from widely derided (remember the memes?) to so popular that seemingly every other tech giant is trying to come up with its own version. \nBut there's a reason why most haven't been able to come close. Not only does Apple have a pretty comfortable head start, but the things that make AirPods so popular — their size and simplicity for iPhone owners — have proven almost impossible to match. Not to mention, no other company has the full power of Apple's branding machine behind it, which has helped transform the buds into a veritable status symbol.\nAt $249 — $100 more than the original — expectations for the \"Pro\" versions are understandably high. But after wearing them for almost an entire day, I feel that Apple has more delivered on this promise. \nAirPods Pro not only improve over previous versions in just about every way, the biggest improvements — noise cancellation, comfort, and sound quality — are big enough that even the most hardened AirPods skeptics will be hard-pressed to complain.\nNew AirPods, who this\nIf you were disappointed that Apple's second-generation AirPods were almost completely identical to the original buds, then you'll appreciate that the \"Pro\" AirPods got a total redesign. Everything from the shape of the case to the size of the actual earbuds has changed.\nThe first thing you notice is the case. One of the best things about AirPods (and the one that has proved most difficult for others to copy) is the size of its charging case, which is often compared to dental floss. \nThe AirPods Pro case is a bit larger than its predecessor but not by much. It's shorter and wider, but the thickness is about the same (and like Apple's second-gen AirPods, it also charges wirelessly or via a lightning cable). Some might be a little disappointed with the added size, but it's really not enough to make much of a difference. It’s still easy to slip into just about any pocket, including the small “watch pocket” on most jeans.\n\nMost importantly, it provides an additional 24 hours of battery life, which is good because Apple's new noise cancellation will drain your AirPods battery a little bit faster than before. I haven't had enough time to put Apple's battery life claims to the test yet, but so far both the buds and the charging case have performed as expected.\nLike the case, the buds themselves are also shorter and wider. The ear tips have soft silicone covers, similar to in-ear buds made by companies not named Apple, and the tips are much shorter than older AirPods. \nI'll talk more about fit in a minute but just to get it out of the way: yes, these are extremely comfortable. Probably the most comfortable in-ear buds I've ever worn.\n\nApple has also changed up the controls. Instead of tapping on the back to answer calls or pause your music, you now squeeze the end of each bud to control playback or answer calls. The end of each bud has a small notch with what Apple calls a \"force sensor,\" which helps you feel where to grab onto the bud.\nA single squeeze will play/pause, a double squeeze will skip to the next track, and three will skip back. If you squeeze and hold, you can toggle between noise cancellation and \"transparency\" mode (more on both in a minute). \nIt took me about half a day to get used to these new gestures, but it’s pretty intuitive overall. My main concern is that it’s not quite as easy to to do while running or working out since it takes a little bit longer to hold and squeeze than it does to tap. But I don’t expect it will be a big problem in most situations.\nThe right fit\nAll these design changes also mean that AirPods Pro fit and feel much different than previous versions (in a good way!).\nI have small ears, and I’ve struggled with just about every pair of earbuds with round tips, no matter what size cover I put on. Not so with AirPods Pro, which have the same angled design as EarPods and AirPods. And the removable silicone tips work a bit differently than other types of earbuds. Instead of having to mash it down onto a plastic tip, each cover snaps into place with a satisfying \"click.\" \n\nAnd, because there's no plastic piece extending into your ear canal, the buds are much more comfortable to leave in for long periods of times. Though I find my original AirPods pretty comfy, my ears can definitely get a bit sore after leaving them in for several hours at a time. Not only has that yet to happen with my AirPods Pro, my regular AirPods now feel significantly less comfortable by comparison. Thanks a lot, Apple. \nGetting the right fit is about more than just comfort, though. Apple's new noise cancellation feature also requires a tight seal in order for it to be really effective. \n\nApple has also created an \"ear tip fit test\" which can help you choose the right size tip by checking whether the buds are sealing properly in your ear. The test is pretty simple. You listen to a short music clip and get a quick assessment of whether they fit properly. The \"test\" feels a little bit gimmicky (I was able to successfully get a \"good fit\" result with each sized tip, though it failed when I purposely had the bud too loose) but Apple says it conducts some pretty sophisticated analysis in order to test whether or not you're getting the best sound. \nApple made other improvements to make the AirPods Pro more comfortable. While other in-ear buds that form a seal can create an uncomfortable amount of pressure, AirPods Pro have a venting system that allows air to travel through the bud itself to minimize this type of pressure. I've always been particularly sensitive to this, so I definitely noticed the lack of pressure compared with other buds I've tried.\n\nStill, I know fit is something that’s different for everyone, and I’ve heard from a lot of people over the years who say AirPods either won’t stay in their ears or are too uncomfortable to wear. While that's never been my experience with AirPods, I do feel the design changes with AirPods Pro should resolve most of these issues. The new tips are not only more comfortable, but the fit is much more snug.\nAnother benefit of the new design: they’re much easier to clean. While earwax and other gunk could easily build up in the many crevices of the older design (gross, I know), the removable tips should be much easier to keep clean. That said, you might not want to pull them off too frequently. \nIt takes a surprising amount of force to yank the tips off. And while this means they shouldn't slide off unintentionally, I do wonder how well they'll hold up over time. In the first 24 hours I had mine, I pulled the tips off several times and I've already started to notice signs of wear on the silicone. I'm guessing most people won't be pulling them off as frequently, and you can buy replacement tips from Apple for $3.95, but it's still annoying to have to worry about. \nNoise cancellation\nOkay, let's talk about the most important feature: noise cancellation. AirPods Pro have active noise cancellation, meaning they are constantly adjusting based on your surroundings in order to tune out ambient noise. It's a pretty complex process that can dynamically adjust 200 times a second, according to Apple. \nIn practice, the noise cancellation is definitely impressive, especially for the size. That said, you shouldn't expect the near total silence you might get with higher-end, over-ear headphones from companies like Sony or Bose. \nBut AirPods Pro are still quite good at tuning out noise, though it does seem to vary a bit based on the type of noise.\nI walked by a (very loud) construction crew in front of our office building and I couldn’t hear the jackhammering at all until I was just a few feet away. But when I was in the office I could easily hear the (muffled) voices of coworkers chatting across the room. While walking down a busy street in downtown San Francisco, they tuned out pretty much all of the traffic noise.\n\nAll that said, these are still small, in-ear buds we’re talking about. So the noise cancellation won’t be as complete as what you get with large over-ear cans. As someone who regularly flies with just my normal (non-noise canceling) AirPods, I’d be more than comfortable hopping on a long flight with just AirPods Pro. But if you're expecting total silence, or you're used to flying with big, over-ear noise-canceling headphones, you'l probably want to stick with those.\nThe upside, of course, is that AirPods are far easier to travel with. For me, the tradeoff in noise cancellation is worth it to not have to lug around big headphones, but I know this won't be true for everyone. \nAll this means that AirPods Pro sound noticeably better than my first-generation AirPods. Not only does noise cancellation make listening to music more immersive, but the sound is clearer and brighter overall. I don't know how else to describe it: everything just sounds really good.\nOne of the only big drawbacks is the price. At $249, the buds are Apple’s priciest AirPods yet. And if you upgraded to Apple’s second-gen AirPods last year, another $249 is probably hard to justify. But if you’re someone who tends to wear your AirPods several hours a day, then the benefits of better sound and noise cancellation are a no-brainer. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1070301%252F9743147f-3649-49c2-9d67-4bcae3730922.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=xJWTqFpSAmV8yFbMB2WMZzn7Le4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105518%252F65d809a8-692c-4bc5-94b6-71490e47d543.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=6_Ru0hXB1D6S11HWk87S0Y2z_YY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105518%252F65d809a8-692c-4bc5-94b6-71490e47d543.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ZiatJ25vQal6kPqzAlOnCAPX_6c=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105518%252F65d809a8-692c-4bc5-94b6-71490e47d543.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=Vzdz07JFiB83tVpKjU1CStpnpMI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

fans","title_tag":null,"author":"Alison Foreman","post_date":"2019-10-04T10:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 04 Oct 2019 10:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"10/04/2019","sort_key":"1Igpdn","link":"https://mashable.com/article/in-the-tall-grass-netflix-review/","content":{"plain":"Warning: The following contains mild spoilers for In the Tall Grass.\nOne of the weirdest corners in the Stephen King multiverse, In the Tall Grass has everything. \nThere's grass, mud, more grass, time travel, true love, eye stabbings, skull smashings, incest, cannibalism, grass again, and a mustachioed Patrick Wilson repeatedly saying, \"Real estate's the game!\" like a creepy step-dad at the neighborhood block party. \nSuffice to say, writer-director Vincenzo Natali's story of tourists lost in a field is a strange one.\nIt's a great story — short, stark, and awful. \nLoosely based on King and son Joe Hill's novella of the same name, Natali's adaptation isn't a complete departure from standard King fare — but it's not what Netflix subscribers who loved 1922 and Gerald's Game were probably expecting.\nAs first told by King and Hill, In the Tall Grass is a chilling meditation on the futility of existence.\nCal (Avery Whitted) and Becky (Laysla De Oliveira), two siblings on a cross-country road trip, are stopped alongside a remote stretch of Route 400 when they hear a boy crying for help. Unable to see the boy beyond the overgrown grass lining the road, the two decide to search for him, but become hopelessly lost. They soon learn that the field they've entered is an inescapable hell, populated by others as doomed as they. \nThe green enclave decimates relationships, forcing characters to turn on one another with venomous rapidity. The descriptions of the atrocities that occur there are disturbing, and the unanswered questions they bring haunting. It's a great story — short, stark, and awful. \nNetflix's take is a bit more involved.\n\nAs enthusiastic and ill-conceived as any r/stephenking theory thread, In the Tall Grass circa 2019 plays more like fan fiction than an adaptation. \nTravis (Harrison Gilbertson), a character mentioned only briefly in the original text, becomes an underdeveloped hero. Ross Humboldt (Patrick Wilson), the story's secondary antagonist, is transformed into a spigot for King-isms and metaphor regurgitation. The lost boy, Tobin (Will Buie Jr.), is contorted beyond recognition with an out-of-place optimism as startling as any monster.  \nAs brilliant as it is stupid, Natali's take on King and Hill's work is a doozy. \nEntirely new for the film are a bunch of CGI'd crows and grass creatures, with bizarre hallucination sequences to underscore their menace. Also original: Everyone taking a trip to a bowling alley, Cal suddenly developing \"a thing\" for his sister, and a woman's head getting popped open Oberyn Martell-style because why not. \nFinally, there's that twist ending, as plot hole heavy as it is unnecessary. \nNaturally, I loved all of it. \nAs brilliant as it is stupid, Natali's take on King and Hill's work is a doozy. It's unclear why he and his fellow creators couldn't sort out where to stop expanding the source material or if they even wanted to. Still, it's a fun watch that will satisfy anyone eager to enjoy a cinematic interpretation of this weird and wonderful world.\nThe greatest achievement of Netflix's In the Tall Grass is the attention it brings to the original story. The second greatest? All the shenanigans it got to pull along the way.\nIn the Tall Grass is now streaming on Netflix. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1057595%252Febab2073-8dba-4460-a546-68341341966c.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=mxVDQMggfMRBTsxWb8R2qpJcQnU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104103%252F485cc63c-96f8-49f8-a13a-a0696bb0e250.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=jMx2Y9ehRaAjfhwBKxXxoW1HuvE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104103%252F485cc63c-96f8-49f8-a13a-a0696bb0e250.png%252F356x205.png?signature=fUHXdZbrEcbKYtVsMOFznsuExhQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F104103%252F485cc63c-96f8-49f8-a13a-a0696bb0e250.png%252F712x410.png?signature=Bu7p4esoE4ZCxByYRwRAL8KkQU8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:
