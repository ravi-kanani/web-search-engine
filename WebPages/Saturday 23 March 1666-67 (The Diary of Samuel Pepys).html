         <p>The King to Ormond<br>Written from: Whitehall<br>Date: 23 March 1667</p> 
         <p>A proclamation, or act of State, is to issue in Ireland, "prohibiting the importation of all commodities of the growth, or manufacture, of any other Kingdom or Country, which our people of Ireland may well live without." ...</p>

         <p>Arlington to Ormond<br>Written from: Whitehall<br>Date: 23 March 1667</p> 
         <p>Enclosed herewith is his Majesty's letter "to recompense the damage that Kingdom hath sustained by the passing of the Irish Cattle Bill, which I do not hear anybody ask his Majesty to support by any act from him; but if the trick go forward of bringing Cattle over, as I hear it hitherto succeeds, the clamour will be doubled upon us." ... This evening, Lord Arran [ son of Ormonde <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5826/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5826/</a> ] brought the Lord Lieutenant's letter of the 16th. ... <br>_____</p> 
         <p>Brodrick to Ormond<br>Written from: London<br>Date: 23 March 1667</p> 
         <p>The West-India Merchants believe that the French were (after obtaining some considerable spoil) repulsed from Antigua by the Planters. ...</p> 
         <p>The East-India Company are fully assured of obtaining Polleron [ Pulo Run, East Indies <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7584/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7584/</a> ] ... with a considerable enlargement of their trade. ... The King presseth them to take Bombay; and my Lord Chancellor [Clarendon] gives them frank hopes that the King of Portugal will deliver Basseur [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasai" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasai</a> in MS.: "Bazire"; it had belonged, by cession, to the Portuguese, since 1534, &amp; was part of the contracted dowry of Queen Catharine; but the Portuguese kept it, until 1765 (Thomson, Gazetteer of India, sub voce)] to his Majesty &amp; his Majesty to them, on very reasonable terms. ... </p>

         <p>Ormond to Orrery<br>Written from: Dublin<br>Date: 23 March 1667</p> 
         <p>... The insolent deportment of the Congregation at mass in Kerry, in rescuing the Tory [ <a href="http://bit.ly/bjK8EF" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/bjK8EF</a> ], calls for full inquiry. ... It is hoped that to any of more than common quality, who stood by whilst it was done, Lord Orrery will teach their duty upon such an occasion. ...</p> 
         <p>Communicates, at great length, various details concerning matters of revenue &amp; trade. ... Much wonders to find that it should be held [by some of the Ministers in England] fitter for the King to allow - as the less inconvenience to that Kingdom - the liberty of transporting wool [ from Ireland ] into foreign parts, rather "than that of a free trade with the American Plantations. It was otherwise esteemed in former times, and will be still so thought by me, till I am convinced of the contrary by some other arguments than bare assertions." ... </p>

         <p>"3.23 a busy day on the Irish front."</p> 
         <p>Yes, cape henry:</p> 
         <p>'Tis still about the Act for the Settlement of Ireland which "imposed penalties including death and land confiscation against participants and bystanders of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and subsequent unrest [ guerrilla insurgency ]....The act was passed on 12 August 1652 by the Rump Parliament of England, who had taken power after the Second English Civil War and had agreed to the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The conquest was deemed necessary as Royalist supporters of Charles II of England had allied themselves with the Confederation of Kilkenny (the confederation formed by Irish Catholics during the Irish Confederate Wars) and so was a threat to the newly formed English Commonwealth...." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1652" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_16…</a> </p>

         <p>To be sure, one might object that the "Act of Settlement (1662) passed by the Irish Parliament in Dublin...was a partial reversal of the Cromwellian Act of Settlement 1652....</p> 
         <p>"The [1662] Act describes itself An act for the better execution of His Majesty's gracious declaration for the Settlement of his Kingdom of Ireland, and the satisfaction of the several interests of adventurers1, soldiers, and other his subjects there.</p> 
         <p>"By this measure, what has been described as a, "favoured minority" of Irish Catholics — mostly Old English Royalists — recovered all or most of their pre-war estates. Examples of this include Ormonde and his relatives and supporters like Richard Bellings. The people who had been militant Irish Confederates during the wars — who had rejected an alliance with the English Royalists, or sought better terms from Charles I in return for an alliance — got little or nothing from the settlement. Many of them regarded it as a betrayal by the Stuart monarchy, which they had fought for in the Civil Wars. The poet Daibhi O Bruadair wrote that the Restoration was "Purgatory" for Irish Catholics, while the former Confederate and Catholic Bishop Nicholas French wrote a pamphlet about Charles II titled, The Unkind Deserter of Loyal men and true Friends." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1662" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_16…</a></p>

         <p>"In the greater part of the county of Kerry, in the more remote districts of the counties of Cork and Limerick, and in a very large section of Connaught, a state of society subsisted to which we find no parallel in England, but which bore a striking resemblance to that which was then existing in the Highlands of Scotland. These districts—consisting almost exclusively of wild mountains and bogs, doomed by the nature of the soil to great poverty, traversed by few or no regular roads, far removed from all considerable centres of civilised life, and inhabited chiefly by a wild and wretched population of Catholics—lay virtually beyond the empire of the law. Smuggling was the one lucrative trade, and it was practised equally by landlord, middleman, and tenant, by Catholic and Protestant. The officers of the revenue were baffled by a conspiracy of all classes, and informers were in such danger from popular outrage that they soon abandoned their trade. In the deep natural harbours among the mountains, privateers found their shelter, priests and friars from the Continent landed in safety, recruits were shipped by hundreds for the service of France, and the finest native wool was exchanged for the wines and brandies of the South."

         <p>I found this passage puzzling as well. No mention of what or who's drink she's imbibing and yes Sam seems very indulgent about her derelict duties and potential accidental arson. But drinking all last night and all today? She's on a bender for sure.</p>

         <p>My guess is that Luce has found her way into Sam's wine cellar. But one would think he would be rather more indignant - perhaps she performs other services for him that make up for these lapses?</p>

         <p>Could be Luce's benders are an occassional epic annoyance followed by promises of reform. She's been with them a while I believe. Wasn't she the one Sam once was about to kick when caught by a neighbor's boy servant? Sam does seem to have a certain affection for old time servants...Family. If Luce is a fine cook that alone would make it difficult for him to part with her and Jane probably covers for her a good deal. Perhaps at this stage Sam suffers little from the need to directly control the staff thanks to Jane's supervision and Bess' improved management ability, so he can be a bit more indulgent than the young man for whom troubles with the maids were one more headache in a busy day.</p>

         <p>I think you're right, RG. We have not had Sam being asked to umpire on Bess vs Servants disputes for a long while - things seem to be on an even keel. maybe Sam does not want to risk upsetting this and is prepared to tolerate the tipsiness. But I don't think she can be getting at Sam's wine - I think that would be too much for him. maybe strong beer?</p> 
         <p>Fear of Fire</p> 
         <p>Not sure what is happening in other countries, but over here, it is going to be illegal to sell non-self-extinguishing cigarettes soon. There have been just so many fires caused by drunk persons falling asleep in front of tv with cigarette in hand, which eventually sets the sofa on fire. Alcohol and naked flames and a human tend to lead to house fires. Be afraid Sam, be very afraid. I would be.</p>

         <p>Between the plague and the fire, my bet is any poor, able-bodied, unemployed servant woman has left the expensive, cold, over-crowded City of London. The Lady Magazine of the 17th century burned up in the fire. Luce does all the work no one else wants to do. Plus she seems to be a reasonable cook. And Elizabeth hasn't picked a fight with her yet. Given that there must have been a limited supply of good drudge cooks around, Pepys isn't jumping to a solution he would have had no trouble making three years ago.</p>

         <p>"It shows that we usually have around 1800 users per day, which goes up to over 6000 on 23 March.

         <p>"Meanwhile, for an alternative Pepys parody, magazine The Fence is running a possibly regular series of modern-day-Pepys diaries which are clearly written by someone very familiar with the language of the real thing, ... Here’s the current article (and an archived version in case that disappears), and an excerpt:</p> 
         <p>"'Up betimes and by tube to Westminster, and there busy with several business all morning, for our firm intends a splendid show at the conference in the middle of this month. Then comes the intern to my office like a doting fool, and proves himself an ass talking excitedly of this plague come late out of China, which, he says, is now in Italy. Of which, my wife and I having had no Wi-Fi this last month, I know nothing, only to see how vexed this blockhead intern was did almost make me fearful myself. Yet I remembered talking with my Lord and Lady touching this matter, and him very skeptical, and my lady said to me, ‘What, Mr Pepys – shall’t die of a hiccough at the last?’ And at this jest we were all very merry. Thence home to sing with my wife in the garden, but with much trouble, for it was bitterly cold. And so to bed, our iPhones left downstairs as is now our custom.'</p>

         <p>I think that Phil should be proposed for an MBE. He's done more to bring the wonderful world of Samuel Pepys and England in the turbulent mid-17th century to a whole, world-wide community than many a more orthodox teacher of history and more than several other MBEs that I can think of.</p>
