But we're here to help!\nWe've listed 34 absolute best instagram accounts — in no particular order, beyond being grouped with somewhat similar pages. To be clear, there are certainly plenty of fantastic Instagram pages we've left off. We can't rank them all! But this is what we really love, the best in our eyes. \nWe also tried to feature a mix of accounts. Some will make you laugh, others are our favorite famous Instagrammers, and still others will help you appreciate beautiful photography. Here goes nothing.\nThe best ubiquitous celebrity Instagram accounts\nIf you only followed celebs, Instagram would become a pretty boring place. But there are few accounts that are genuinely good — and several you kind of have to follow, because of the conversation they generate. \n\n@badgirlriri\nRihanna is stylish, funny, effortlessly cool, and imagine not following her?\n         View this post on Instagram           ghetto grinch. #ThisShitIsHeavy ....I teamed up with @thehaasbrothers to create this stand inspired by my tatted hands to hold it up!

She's also one of the most famous people alive — with some 176 million followers — and dominates headlines. If you want to keep up with the times, you've got to follow her. \n         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jan 12, 2020 at 11:10am PST\n\n@iamcardib\nCardi is hilarious and her Instagram is full of intimate peeks into her life — like the time she downed chicken feet and decided to post it. \n\n         View this post on Instagram           How ya doing ? A post shared by  Cardib (@iamcardib) on Sep 24, 2019 at 5:23pm PDT\n \nCutest animal Instagram accounts\nThe internet is pretty much dominated by cute animals, and Instagram is no exception. Read on for some of our faves. \n@thedogist\nThe Dogist is one of the best-known accounts for quality dog snaps. The account also documents (often adorable) moments in the dog's life.\n\n         View this post on Instagram           Angus, English Bulldog, Chelsea, New York, NY • “She’ll eat literally anything. She’ll inhale it.” A post shared by  The Dogist (@thedogist) on Feb 22, 2020 at 7:55am PST\n\n@caenhillcc\nThe Instagram account for the UK's Caenhill Countryside Centre is just delightful. The charity works to teach young people the joys of farming and dealing with animals. There's also a good chance you've met Cuthbert, the Centre's world-famous goose who went viral on TikTok alongside farmer Chris Franklin. \n\n         View this post on Instagram           Cuthbert was happy to see Benedict at the farm today @caroline.le.bourgeois @klf0905 @caenhillcc_animalphotos @spottycroccy A post shared by  Caenhillcc animals (@caenhillcc) on Feb 26, 2020 at 1:12pm PST\n\n@farmanimalrefuge\nThe posts from this animal rescue in San Diego is a gold mine for cute animal videos. \n@yaboi_toby_toad\nJust a little toad, doing everyday tasks.\n\n         View this post on Instagram           bekfust A post shared by  Toby Toad (@yaboi_toby_toad) on Feb 12, 2020 at 9:44am PST\n\n@bagdogs\nSometimes it takes a little bit of creativity to tote your pup around town.

An updated blog post laying out the new guidelines made clear that Twitter, at least in theory, will no longer tolerate this specific type of dangerous medical misinformation on its platform.  \n\"Update: we’re expanding our safety rules to include content that could place people at a higher risk of transmitting COVID-19,\" read the announcement. \nNotably, those changes include: \"Denial of expert guidance,\" \"Encouragement to use fake or ineffective treatments, preventions, and diagnostic techniques,\" and \"Misleading content purporting to be from experts or authorities.\" \nContent that increases the chance that someone contracts or transmits the virus, including:- Denial of expert guidance- Encouragement to use fake or ineffective treatments, preventions, and diagnostic techniques- Misleading content purporting to be from experts or authorities— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) March 18, 2020\n\nThe ban on \"Encouragement to use fake or ineffective treatments\" is of particular note as it follows a tweet by Elon Musk, a prominent Twitter user with over 32 million followers as of the time of this writing, loosely suggesting treatments for COVID-19. \nHydroxychloroquine probably betterhttps://t.co/FWn2kh1LZx pic.twitter.com/wQODHiFeWT— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 17, 2020\n\nMusk, of course, is neither a medical doctor nor an epidemiologist despite what his seemingly authoritative tweets on the coronavirus might suggest. \nTwitter, however, was kind enough to provide us with examples that don't involve Elon \"let's keep the Tesla plant open during a shelter-in-place emergency\" Musk. \nUnder Twitter's updated rules, people posting versions of the following will be \"required to remove\" said tweets: \n\n  \"social distancing is not effective\"\n  \"coronavirus is not heat-resistant - walking outside is enough to disinfect you\"\n  \"use aromatherapy and essential oils to prevent COVID-19\"\n  \"drinking bleach and ingesting colloidal silver will cure COVID-19\"\n  \"COVID-19 does not infect children because we haven’t seen any cases of children being sick\"\n  \"coronavirus is a fraud and not real -

Social distancing and shelter-in-place orders, like the one issued to the Bay Area on Monday, are meant to dramatically reduce new infections so that the healthcare system can treat current patients without becoming dangerously overwhelmed. \nPeople who take this urgent task seriously have been logging on to share related content with their friends, family, and followers, hoping to convince them to stay home. There are pleas from professionals like physicians and engineers, a widely shared video that uses lit matches to demonstrate the effect of social distancing, and memes that pack a lot of information into a bite-size post. \nThis is an emotional time; people feeling fear, anxiety, and grief are sharing information to educate others and gain some sense of control over what happens next. But, amidst those intense feelings, it's important to think twice about what you share. \nSEE ALSO: Coronavirus reveals everything that's wrong with our mental health care system\nSaurabh Mehta, an associate professor of global health, epidemiology, and nutrition at Cornell University, said that it's ideal to start with information from recognized institutions and agencies, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Next, try to distinguish between official communications and anecdotes. \nWhile the latter can be more powerful and persuasive because they're grounded in people's lived experiences, it's best to reflect on whether they match what experts say. \nFinally, Mehta recommends trying to gauge the purpose of the content you'd like to share: \"[A]sk yourself if the news/post aims to be informative or to alarm you and get your attention,\" he wrote in an email. \nIf you see social media posts sharing information you know to be inaccurate or untrue, Mehta said to avoid sharing, clicking, or retweeting it. \"If it prompts a question from within your friend network or family, refer them to one of the trusted sources [like the CDC or WHO],\" Mehta wrote. \nAmong the best coronavirus-related content Mehta's seen shared are the following: \n1.  \"Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially, and how to 'flatten the curve'\"\nSource: Washington Post\nWhy: \"Easy-to-understand visual animations represent disease spread and the importance of isolation.\"\n\n2. \"How Coronavirus Hijacks Your Cells\"\nSource: The New York Times\nWhy: \"This article describes in very simple words and with cartoons how the virus enters the body, infects human cells and spreads. It also includes helpful explanations on why washing your hands with soap is currently one of the best strategies for prevention.\" \n\n3. \"Self-Quarantine? Isolation? Social Distancing? What They Mean And When To Do Them\"\nSource: NPR\nWhy: \"Includes a Q&A section on what terms like quarantine, self-isolation, and social-isolation mean and why they are considered necessary measures to reduce the transmission of the corona virus.\" \nMehta also recommends checking the CDC section that describes key steps to protect yourself and others, and the CDC's YouTube channel, which airs briefings and videos with information relevant to COVID-19. \nTaking a few extra steps before sharing coronavirus content online can help ensure you're posting accurate, actionable information with others. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1249490%252F5dc582b8-5735-4a2d-8dcf-92a39d059843.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=-V9YPE8RgjCHZ9MW4SoIMFV09cI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112135%252F0d89cd1b-390b-4d36-a9de-70ea31ee233d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=cIxkk1Qh6jUH2IlUJh2FQ0P5GGQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112135%252F0d89cd1b-390b-4d36-a9de-70ea31ee233d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=-Fs1Vf7st3gfCUpxA-nUQvwy600=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112135%252F0d89cd1b-390b-4d36-a9de-70ea31ee233d.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=dFT4R8VI_geUJCZ6XaCBVm7evXE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Want to share viral coronavirus content?

Once the first match is lit the flame quickly spreads to those nearby, but as soon as one of the matches (with legs) steps out of line the fire becomes contained.\nThe increased space between the matches helps stop the fire from spreading, just as social distancing will help stop germs from spreading. The visual representation is a stark and clear reminder of why it's so crucial for people — even those who feel healthy and might not be experiencing any coronavirus symptoms — to stay home when possible and limit exposure to groups.\nWATCH: Social distancing could be our best weapon against coronavirus\n\nA similar photo of matches is being shared on social media — often with the caption, \"This photo has been shared by doctors in Greece. 'The one who stayed away saved them all.'\"\nAgain, there's a row of burnt matches, one match removed from the line, and all of the matches beyond it saved from the scorch.\nSocial distancing in one image. pic.twitter.com/fuSNnpXltO— Gregg Gonsalves (@gregggonsalves) March 12, 2020\n\nThe match concept has inspired a number of Instagram artists to create their own versions of the images.

Luckily, there is a way to add some fun into the mix — or whatever passes as \"fun\" in these times, anyway — by changing your Zoom background to something weird.\nZoom's virtual background feature allows users to display a picture or video behind their floating head in lieu of their normal, boring living room. This has several advantages: It's way more interesting to look at a video of a roller coaster than the blank, beige wall of your apartment, and also it lets you off the hook from before every meeting, lest anyone see the squalor in which you have self-quarantined. (You don't have to clean anyway, of course, but a lot of people would.)\nBut what should you choose as the background that will make all your coworkers or students laugh, cementing your position as the funniest person on the Zoom call? Naturally there's already a database of high-res images to choose from, courtesy of the sales management platform Ambition.\nIts Monday, and Zoom Backgrounds is live! We're all working from home.

misinformation on Facebook isn’t off to a good start, at least according to one study.\nResearchers at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering discovered that tens of thousands of Facebook pages have found workarounds to the social network’s political advertising disclosure rules. The study was shared with the The Washington Post, which published its findings.\nThe study looked at Facebook’s online advertising archive between May 2018 and June 2019. The findings “point to myriad opportunities malicious actors may have had to exploit the platform’s powerful targeting tools while hiding their tracks, misleading users and evading Facebook’s enforcement,” according to The Washington Post.\nResearchers found that more than 86,000 Facebook pages ran political advertisements that were not properly disclosed in accordance with the company’s policies. Around 20,000 advertisements were also purchased by “likely inauthentic communities,” which the report defines as “clusters of pages that appear to be linked because they promoted the same or similar messages.” \nFacebook eventually discovered the political ads and included them in its ad archive. \nBig money is being spent on these shady ads, the study found. According to one example, sixteen clusters of Facebook pages had purchased around $3.8 million in political ads.\nThe study also discovered that some of these ads were from businesses “looking to advance their interests without clear fingerprints.” It found advertisements using political messaging to sell insurance products.\nFor example, one cluster of 13 Facebook pages was pushing a “questionable insurance product” called “TrumpCare” in order to target supporters of the president. Advertisements like these often did not disclose the connections between the Facebook pages. Some didn’t link to registered businesses, which would run afoul of Facebook’s own rules.\nIn 2018, Facebook launched a set of new advertising policies in order to increase transparency around the ads. The company created an archive of all political advertising that ran on the platform and started disclosing the organization behind each within the ad. The changes were made in the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where foreign interference attempted to influence the elections. A year later, Facebook rolled out these rules worldwide.\nThe Mark Zuckerberg-founded social network has most recently courted controversy with another set of politics-related policies. Last year, Facebook issued a new policy that essentially exempts politicians from its misinformation guidelines, allowing them to lie on the platform. The company was roundly criticized for its decision.\nThis latest study shows that one of the challenges ahead isn’t just for Facebook to roll out good, effective policy. It’s also required that the company enforces the policies it already has."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1238194%252Fc2efb594-6c66-4226-9e75-712b713831ee.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=nlucTp1M3ZqSOTfuzKyQtQjwlvE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111699%252Fbdf12711-1db6-45e9-9cc6-cdc571b64a14.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=A6E73a8t0gqFMv6JAR24C8gn5Xo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111699%252Fbdf12711-1db6-45e9-9cc6-cdc571b64a14.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=-zPKIZ7G9eitgetFuqOmn6KHg_0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111699%252Fbdf12711-1db6-45e9-9cc6-cdc571b64a14.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=ekc8Sx0gZszzm5WF7YKLO4wZDQY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111699%252Fbdf12711-1db6-45e9-9cc6-cdc571b64a14.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=LGjCnGi7UQyjNfpYWHXBk1bF_ag=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111699%252Fbdf12711-1db6-45e9-9cc6-cdc571b64a14.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=STzCSDKhK2E59Vg2zHfuA37Mvmc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-facebook-political-ads-disclosure-study.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-facebook-political-ads-disclosure-study.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1238194%252Fc2efb594-6c66-4226-9e75-712b713831ee.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=K5jkU6Vl5Su7oXk9-CLXuDxHZ9w=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1238194%252Fc2efb594-6c66-4226-9e75-712b713831ee.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=jhVgEAnkp0eLwm-qZR9z--PTnus=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  chesnot / Getty Images"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Thousands of political ads are sneaking around Facebook’s disclosure rules","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Why isn't Facebook enforcing its own transparency rules?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Thousands of political ads are sneaking around Facebook’s disclosure rules"},{"_id":"5e597e2128cc367ecf000019","id":"/article/coronavirus-prevention-dont-touch-your-face/","title":"Coronavirus prevention has people making memes about how they can't stop touching their faces","title_tag":null,"author":"Chloe Bryan","post_date":"2020-02-28T20:54:47+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 20:54:47 +0000","formatted_date":"02/28/2020","sort_key":"1J7Tgd","link":"https://mashable.com/article/coronavirus-prevention-dont-touch-your-face/","content":{"plain":"According to guidelines released by the Center for Disease Control, one of the most effective ways to protect yourself against the novel coronavirus is to avoid touching your face.

Per hour! When you realize you've been doing that for a lifetime, it can be pretty jarring, especially if you know it's best to break the habit.

There are a number of easy, free precautions you can take to protect yourself, like washing your hands frequently and keeping your devices and work surfaces clean. \nThere's still a lot of coronavirus misinformation out there, though. Take a look at the World Health Organization's myth busting page if you're unsure whether you've received good information.\nAnd if you're in the United States, there's no need to panic. Dr. Purvi Parikh, a clinical assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Health, told Mashable's Natasha Piñon on Thursday that while \"it's good to take precautions,\" US residents shouldn't freak out just yet. \nThat doesn't mean you can touch your face, though.

You'll probably tap through a few, but it's likely that the story you watch most isn't someone you follow at all. It's your own.\nFor better or for worse (probably both), Stories have fundamentally changed the way people use the platform. The feature, which was originally a blatant rip-off of Snapchat Stories, gave users an unfussy alternative to the curated glamour of the grid. Now, they can post chiller stuff on Stories even if they don't necessarily want it to stay online forever. After all, Stories disappear after 24 hours.\nBut while Stories may have changed the way we share things on Instagram, it didn't change one of the big reasons we're there in the first place: the confidence boost that comes with looking good for others. \nMe watching my own instagram stories pic.twitter.com/YWp570bTuN— Courtney Miller (@Co_Mill) February 26, 2019\n\nGrace, a 17-year-old student in Tennessee, said in an interview that she often finds herself rewatching her own Stories, particularly ones that include a picture of her. \"I guess I just care a little more about what people are thinking about a picture of me [and] who has seen it,\" she said. When she rewatches those stories, she explained, \"I'm obsessing over if the picture is good or not.\" When she uploads poems or photos that aren't hers, however, she doesn't notice herself rewatching at all. \nA propensity for rewatching doesn't necessarily need to be about your own appearance, though. Joey, a 28-year-old furniture maker in Boston, Massachusetts, says he's most likely to rewatch Stories where he's shared his solo pursuits: a meal he's made, a walk he's taken, a view he's seen. Images of himself aren't a factor. In fact, he said he's never posted a picture of his own face.\nHe doesn't feel the same impulse to rewatch when he posts Stories of his friends, however. \"I already know they're watching and responding,\" he said. \"Also I might still be with those friends, so I'm distracted.\"\nSEE ALSO: Fine, break up with me, but let me keep Instagramming your dog\nJon, a 30-year old account executive in Birmingham, Alabama, said he watches his own Story often — over 20 times per day on some days. Unlike Grace, though, he's most likely to rewatch a Story if it involves video or music. \"It's basically a Hit Clip,\" he said.\nI, for my part, watch my own Story all the time, especially if I think it's good. If I really think about it, I'm imagining myself as a viewer: happening upon my extremely good story, feeling surprised at how wonderful it is, then smiling with deep satisfaction at my mastery of the platform. Is it just another photo of soup in dim apartment lighting? Yes. But I loved making the soup, and I felt excited to share it, and I want the people looking at it to be excited too. When I think about people enjoying the Story, I feel significantly more convinced that my soup endeavor was worthwhile. \nA psychologist's analysis\nI'm not proud of any of this, but I'm certainly not alone in it. According to Dr. Allison Forti, an assistant professor of counseling at Wake Forest University, the tendency to watch our own fleeting content can be partially explained by a psychological concept called the \"looking glass self,\" which posits that people's sense of self is rooted partially in how they feel they're perceived by others. \n\"Applied to repeatedly viewing Instagram stories, it is possible that people are viewing how they look and what they said or did to inform their self-identity,\" she said. \"For example, if they watch a story where they determine they look good, were funny or thoughtful, and others would probably rate them positively, they might repeatedly view that story to reinforce a positive aspect of their identity in which they have value, worth, and other people accept them.\"\nme watching my own instagram story for the 47th time on any given mundane day pic.twitter.com/5wFQ1tBCMm— tyler oakley (@tyleroakley) October 22, 2018\n\nThat's certainly the case with my soup posts. Even though I eat cheese and crackers for dinner while sitting sideways on a kitchen chair as often as I make meals from scratch, knowing how to cook is a venerated quality — it reads as \"good\" to pretty much everyone, especially in the age of viral recipes. By watching myself perform my \"good' qualities publicly, I'm telling myself that the performance could actually be me. I convince myself that of course I'm someone who would cook elaborate meals, even though I know I'm not and don't, all things considered, feel particularly bad about that. It all comes back to my idea of how people see me.\nInstagram dramaturgy\nDr. Kent Bausman, a professor in the Online Sociology program at Maryville University, links the phenomenon to the sociologist Erving Goffman. Goffman, who worked primarily in the mid-20th century, developed the sociological concept of dramaturgy: that life, self, and human interaction can be understood in terms of actors performing on a stage. \n\"When we go about our day, when we go into the world and interact with the world, that's our front stage performance. We are giving a performance of ourselves to the world,\" Bausman explained in an interview. \"But when we come home we get off that stage.\" Goffman referred to that resting state as the \"backstage,\" a place where we process the events of the front stage, either by ourselves or in front of a very different audience.\nBy watching myself perform my \"good\" qualities publicly, I'm telling myself that the performer could actually be me.\n\"Backstage we reflect, we process,\" Bausman explained. \"How did our day go? [It's] that natural reflection that can be done in isolation or in communication with other people, but it tends to be a little bit more informal.\"\nGoffman worked in a time before the internet. But Bausman thinks the ideas of front stage and backstage performances are still applicable to our digital lives — albeit in different terms. It's no longer the case that our public lives are viewable (front stage) and our private lives are not (backstage), he explained, because the internet allows our followers access to some version of our private lives as well. The appeal of Stories — and of why we're fascinated by our own — lies in their backstage characteristics: their naturalness, their flippancy, their rejection of a certain kind of performance.\nWe've done this since the days of MySpace, of course, but the way we share ourselves online has changed with the platforms. Until recently, Instagram grids favored glossy, curated photos with a unified aesthetic; now many of the platform's biggest stars favor a look that deliberately eschews filters, editing, and manipulation — or the appearance of them, anyway. Bad lighting? Fine. Selfies in dirty mirrors? Sure. Sloppily filmed videos in unkempt bedrooms? Great. It's all meant to be casual and uncontrived.\nSEE ALSO: 'Finstas' can be boring or funny or sexy — but they're always real\nStories go hand in hand with this new approach. \"[Stories have] that appeal of showing a less polished version\" of a public presentation, explained Bausman. On a curated grid, we show a front stage self. On Stories, he said, we're more likely to show a backstage self: looser, more natural, and possibly in a state of temporary reflection. While not a grid-Stories split, Joey's Stories mirror this idea: His Stories with friends reflect social, front stage moments, while his solo Stories focus primarily on the self he performs when he is alone.\ngetting ready for a long night in of watching my own instagram story on repeat.  pic.twitter.com/urab8lHgB6— Kyle Krieger (@kylekrieger) May 2, 2019\n\n(It's also true, of course, that the \"unfiltered\" self we share on things like Stories, finstas, and private pages aren't 100 percent devoid of performance. Pointedly \"relatable\" content is one example.) \nWhen we then watch our own Stories back, we're doubling down on that reflective state — not just for our followers, but for ourselves. Like the Story, the reflective state doesn't last forever, but it does allow us insight into a self that would be inaccessible through a more classically performative presentation. That's appealing, Bausman explained, in part because users — especially younger ones — are increasingly wary of their own online footprint. \n\"This isn't a permanent record,\" he said. \"It's a way for me to reflect again on the presentation of myself in the virtual world.\"\nBut is watching my own Story ... bad?\nAll this doesn't mean, necessarily, that your particular fondness for watching your own Stories matches either of these interpretations. People watch their own Stories for technical reasons all the time — Joey, for instance, likes to rewatch Stories where he's timed music to video to make sure the timing is perfect. (After that, though, he does do a few rewatches strictly to \"enjoy the results.\") And, as The Verge addressed in a 2017 episode of the podcast Why'd You Push That Button? (a must-listen if you interested in this subject), the impulse can come down to something simple, like feeling bored and seizing an opportunity for nostalgia. \nBut it never hurts to look deeper — especially if you find yourself watching your own Story an amount that feels like too much. Luckily, you can take measures to curb the habit if it's not working for you.\nAccording to Dr. Forti, the key is self-compassion. \"Rather than repeatedly view Instagram stories to boost a positive self-identity, consider directing compassion toward yourself and all of your perceived shortcomings or failures,\" she said. She recommends self-compassion exercises like meditation or journaling — tiny steps to help you develop a gentler way of looking at yourself without resorting to an artificial self-esteem boost.\nI, for one, could probably use a little more self-compassion and a little less time spent staring at my own soup photos. You, however, should look at my soup photos. Not to brag, but I make really delicious soup, and I could really use the views."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1220954%252F29b05b0f-1d84-423a-aeb1-3843052b030d.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=-k2zcUi6FzHgSX4Wpbvb_oHP1pM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111218%252F53a20016-275e-4891-8a73-13865ae19bde.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=QtSg7NQd_SlM24HjkRPRzrA0Koc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111218%252F53a20016-275e-4891-8a73-13865ae19bde.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=EGICbjWac_2eTyVonVjVH0kTivw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111218%252F53a20016-275e-4891-8a73-13865ae19bde.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=gMLeqKKEgAbuyaTpjEhkZNT0l0g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111218%252F53a20016-275e-4891-8a73-13865ae19bde.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=YRz44hLYAI9tRSxu8pk6gnjsq_s=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111218%252F53a20016-275e-4891-8a73-13865ae19bde.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=IrKMcUdQxJEhOaH1Q9JjlwkD2_0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-watching-your-own-instagram-story.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-watching-your-own-instagram-story.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1220954%252F29b05b0f-1d84-423a-aeb1-3843052b030d.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=-647BR5xs0xtbhpp9TtGA0DDzRY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1220954%252F29b05b0f-1d84-423a-aeb1-3843052b030d.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=BouHIT-wXlzZg70ufSRdWRcaVB8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Vicky Leta / Mashable"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Why is it so tempting to rewatch your own Instagram Story?","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"A psychologist and a sociologist weigh in.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Why is it so tempting to rewatch your own Instagram Story?"},{"_id":"5e4eee55f11b2c7ac0000013","id":"/article/twitter-threading-update-tweets/","title":"Twitter keeps making it easier to thread tweets for some reason","title_tag":null,"author":"Alex Perry","post_date":"2020-02-20T20:38:43+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:38:43 +0000","formatted_date":"02/20/2020","sort_key":"1J4SAP","link":"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-threading-update-tweets/","content":{"plain":"Once upon a time, Twitter's whole thing was that people were supposed to keep their messages short and to the point.

Tweet threading is a feature that's been around for several years, but now you can choose to add a new tweet you're drafting to an existing thread right from the text box.

For years, those of us who don't know how to be concise had to thread our tweets together by writing each new entry as a reply to the previous tweet. Twitter eventually started letting people pre-draft threads to publish all at once. But if you're not interested in thinking ahead by more than a few seconds, this newest feature will let you string your thoughts together with a little less effort.\nSEE ALSO: Twitter will label deepfakes and other 'manipulated media'\nFrom the standpoint of someone who already spends too much time on Twitter and would prefer to melt my brain a little less every day, this just adds a few degrees to the thermometer. \nIt's fine for Twitter to support threading, especially as the site makes threads a little easier to read and, potentially, ignore.

is sick and tired of your coronavirus misinformation bullshit. \nLate Wednesday afternoon, the social media giant was forced to \"expand\" its already existing safety rules in the face of content that could directly put people's lives at risk from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. An updated blog post laying out the new guidelines made clear that Twitter, at least in theory, will no longer tolerate this specific type of dangerous medical misinformation on its platform.  \n\"Update: we’re expanding our safety rules to include content that could place people at a higher risk of transmitting COVID-19,\" read the announcement. \nNotably, those changes include: \"Denial of expert guidance,\" \"Encouragement to use fake or ineffective treatments, preventions, and diagnostic techniques,\" and \"Misleading content purporting to be from experts or authorities.\" \nContent that increases the chance that someone contracts or transmits the virus, including:- Denial of expert guidance- Encouragement to use fake or ineffective treatments, preventions, and diagnostic techniques- Misleading content purporting to be from experts or authorities— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) March 18, 2020\n\nThe ban on \"Encouragement to use fake or ineffective treatments\" is of particular note as it follows a tweet by Elon Musk, a prominent Twitter user with over 32 million followers as of the time of this writing, loosely suggesting treatments for COVID-19. \nHydroxychloroquine probably betterhttps://t.co/FWn2kh1LZx pic.twitter.com/wQODHiFeWT— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 17, 2020\n\nMusk, of course, is neither a medical doctor nor an epidemiologist despite what his seemingly authoritative tweets on the coronavirus might suggest. \nTwitter, however, was kind enough to provide us with examples that don't involve Elon \"let's keep the Tesla plant open during a shelter-in-place emergency\" Musk. \nUnder Twitter's updated rules, people posting versions of the following will be \"required to remove\" said tweets: \n\n  \"social distancing is not effective\"\n  \"coronavirus is not heat-resistant - walking outside is enough to disinfect you\"\n  \"use aromatherapy and essential oils to prevent COVID-19\"\n  \"drinking bleach and ingesting colloidal silver will cure COVID-19\"\n  \"COVID-19 does not infect children because we haven’t seen any cases of children being sick\"\n  \"coronavirus is a fraud and not real - go out and patronize your local bar!!\"\n  \"the news about washing your hands is propaganda for soap companies, stop washing your hands\"\n  \"ignore news about COVID-19, it's just an attempt to destroy capitalism by crashing the stock market\"\n  \"The National Guard just announced that no more shipments of food will be arriving for 2 months -

respiratory disease COVID-19 — continues to spread around the world, talk of social distancing is dominating the news cycle.\nIt's clear that some people, such as the many Americans who continued to hit up bars over the weekend, still don't understand the importance of avoiding crowds and keeping at least three feet of space between yourself and others, but government officials and healthcare professionals believe that social distancing is the key to slowing the spread of this virus.\nIn an effort to help everyone see just how critical social distancing can be during this tumultuous time, people are creating helpful visual aids using matches. \n         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Juan Delcan, Valentina (@juan_delcan) on Mar 15, 2020 at 5:46am PDT\n\nSEE ALSO: It's time to get serious about coronavirus social distancing\nA popular video shared to Instagram by artist @juan_delcan shows a row of matches burning. Once the first match is lit the flame quickly spreads to those nearby, but as soon as one of the matches (with legs) steps out of line the fire becomes contained.\nThe increased space between the matches helps stop the fire from spreading, just as social distancing will help stop germs from spreading. The visual representation is a stark and clear reminder of why it's so crucial for people — even those who feel healthy and might not be experiencing any coronavirus symptoms — to stay home when possible and limit exposure to groups.\nWATCH: Social distancing could be our best weapon against coronavirus\n\nA similar photo of matches is being shared on social media — often with the caption, \"This photo has been shared by doctors in Greece. 'The one who stayed away saved them all.'\"\nAgain, there's a row of burnt matches, one match removed from the line, and all of the matches beyond it saved from the scorch.\nSocial distancing in one image. pic.twitter.com/fuSNnpXltO— Gregg Gonsalves (@gregggonsalves) March 12, 2020\n\nThe match concept has inspired a number of Instagram artists to create their own versions of the images. They're now being shared in an effort to encourage isolation and hopefully \"flatten the curve.\"\n         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Lanni Maszerowski (@lannimade) on

more and more people begin to work and attend class remotely due to coronavirus, the switch from in-person meetings to constant Zoom calls has been pretty jarring. Luckily, there is a way to add some fun into the mix — or whatever passes as \"fun\" in these times, anyway — by changing your Zoom background to something weird.\nZoom's virtual background feature allows users to display a picture or video behind their floating head in lieu of their normal, boring living room. This has several advantages: It's way more interesting to look at a video of a roller coaster than the blank, beige wall of your apartment, and also it lets you off the hook from before every meeting, lest anyone see the squalor in which you have self-quarantined. (You don't have to clean anyway, of course, but a lot of people would.)\nBut what should you choose as the background that will make all your coworkers or students laugh, cementing your position as the funniest person on the Zoom call? Naturally there's already a database of high-res images to choose from, courtesy of the sales management platform Ambition.\nIts Monday, and Zoom Backgrounds is live! We're all working from home.

This is incredibly useful advice — you shouldn't be touching your face anyway — but it's also making people realize just how much they're scratching their noses and grazing their mouths unconsciously.\nThe average person touches their face 23 times per hour. Per hour! When you realize you've been doing that for a lifetime, it can be pretty jarring, especially if you know it's best to break the habit. And what do extremely online people do when they're trying to change something about their lives?

There are a number of easy, free precautions you can take to protect yourself, like washing your hands frequently and keeping your devices and work surfaces clean. \nThere's still a lot of coronavirus misinformation out there, though. Take a look at the World Health Organization's myth busting page if you're unsure whether you've received good information.\nAnd if you're in the United States, there's no need to panic. Dr. Purvi Parikh, a clinical assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Health, told Mashable's Natasha Piñon on Thursday that while \"it's good to take precautions,\" US residents shouldn't freak out just yet. \nThat doesn't mean you can touch your face, though.

Oh yeah, and you'd better believe you're famous as hell. \nThe app, released yesterday, is like a Twitter clone that dispensed with the notion that bots can or should be removed from the platform. \n\"Botnet is a social network simulator where you're the only human along with a million bots who are obsessed with you,\" explains the app's website.\nMade by Billy Chasen of turntable.fm fame, Botnet allows anyone bored or curious enough to download it a constant stream of interaction from fake accounts. It's an oddly fascinating experience, and provides insight as to why Elon Musk just can't log the hell off.  \n\n\"This started as a fun thought experiment around how we can use bots for good (considering all the negative uses lately),\" Chasen told Mashable over email. \"What if there are always people to talk to and share opinions with? Maybe the world would feel less lonely (albeit simulated).\"\nThe app is a mixture of hilarious and unsettling. When a Botnet commenter told me that \"Keanu Reeves\" would win the New Hampshire primary, I laughed out loud at my desk. That the app might actually make a person feel less lonely? I'm not sure what to make of that. \nBotnet is free to download, but it does offer up some tempting in-app purchases. Want to spice up your experience with \"Dad bot?\" That will be $.99, please. \n\n\"This feels a bit more like an art project than actual company,\" Chasen wrote, \"but we'll see where it goes.\"\nNotably, Botnet isn't the first fake social media app we've seen. Back in 2017, Binky offered bored users the chance to scroll through endless pages of fake social posts. \n\"Unlike similar apps such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, Binky won't stress you out or make you hate your friends,\" read the app's description. \"It just keeps your attention where it belongs: on your phone.\"\nBotnet takes this idea one step further, and actually provides feedback to your inane posts. \nImportantly, Chasen told Mashable that this isn't the type of weird data grab that we might expect from a real social media company like Facebook. \nSEE ALSO: Look at these dumb email accounts Russian trolls made to influence the 2016 election\n\"Botnet doesn't record what people are posting,\" he wrote. \"There are just some very basic metrics around installs and if people purchase upgrades.\"\nIn other words, feel free to go nuts posting to your heart's content. Your millions of Botnet followers will surely thank you. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1197919%252F651ff64a-32e7-45b3-9037-d17cbcc27cde.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=5mT_TFLjayvHrqRB-cEGPAJtSp4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=wfD4x0s64DRjJtgzAJO2vNxR3LY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=nBVNm1lxseggvow8fiGPLYE4kPQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=BHcuZHSVmxSajCtoX4XJTyvaK2g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=141lSXb9DmSmRP-_T4KDp-BozZw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=Wyxx02k0upC-GWlMqIykI_x7toA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"This 'social media' app full of bots constantly complimenting you is intensely bizarre","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=nBVNm1lxseggvow8fiGPLYE4kPQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=Mjv3OnAVG75FbtEBE9mIUZaah-8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=7Er2OnDY8HsqasEiYH007_P0dCQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=141lSXb9DmSmRP-_T4KDp-BozZw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110632%252F6f0b44f8-350a-4d18-9260-b61384566bfe.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=nBVNm1lxseggvow8fiGPLYE4kPQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"This 'social media' app full of bots constantly complimenting you is intensely bizarre","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"No wonder Elon can't log off.

But you might not know the lyrics — even if you think you do.\n\"Opaul\" is a 2018 song by rapper Freddie Dredd, who also produced the track under the pseudonym Ryan C. But the singing you hear in the TikTok sound isn’t Freddie Dredd. It’s a sample of the Portuguese-language song “David” (also called \"Odavi\") by Brazilian singer-songwriter Célia. Freddie told Mashable via Twitter DM that he named the song after his friend Paul, who introduced him to the Célia track.\nThe sound includes these lyrics from Célia: \"Oh Davi / não vai não / Agora que esse som tá ficando bom,\" which translates roughly to \"Oh Davi, don’t go / Now that this song is getting good.\" Some people — including this TikToker who speaks Portuguese, hear \"volte aqui,\" which means \"come back,\" but \"Oh Davi\" makes more sense given the song’s title.\nMost English-speaking TikTokers aren’t lip-synching any of those lyrics, though. Instead, they’re saying either \"No, I know\" or \"Love, I know\" in the place of \"não vai não.\" (The three are similar phonetically.) Then they’re crafting their TikToks around those inaccurate interpretations.\n\nTake this TikTok from user @iamjuststephf, which shows a girl realizing that her crush has been waxing poetic to his parents about another girl instead of her. \n\"You look so different from the pictures our son showed us,\" say the parents.\n\"No, I know,\" the girl says, looking lividly at the camera.\nSEE ALSO: A guide to using TikTok's algorithm to watch videos you actually like\nUsing the phrase \"love, I know,\" became popular shortly thereafter, when TikTok megastar Charli D’Amelio incorporated those false lyrics into her own \"Opaul\" choreography. The dance went viral — as does everything D’Amelio makes — inspiring hundreds of other TikTokers to draw hearts with their hands as they mouthed the wrong words.\n\nIt's worth noting that most TikTokers seem to be aware that the song isn't actually in English. For one thing, a lot of the videos flash the words \"no, I know\" onscreen while the user is lip-synching, implying that the script is different than the actual audio. Still, the misinterpretation has understandably frustrated some users, who feel that twisting a Portuguese song from Brazil into English is disrespectful to both Célia and the language itself.\n\"People who think it's 'no I know': 🤡🤡🤡,\" reads one comment.\ntik tok has taken opaulim so sorry— FREDDIE DREDD (@FreddieDredd) January 15, 2020\n\nAt some point, corrections in the comments reached a fever pitch, driving some TikTokers to try to fend off criticism preemptively on their own videos. Now, in a classic case of internet over-saturation, correcting the lyrics has become somewhat passé. On @iamjuststephf's video above, for instance, the top comment is \"People who still say 'those aren't the words': 🤡🤡🤡.\"\nFreddie Dredd, for his part, is surprised that anyone thinks the song sounds like English at all. \"It's so obviously not [English],\" he said. \"But if it wasn’t for them mistakenly thinking it was English,\" he theorized, \"the trend probably wouldn’t have done as well as it did.\"\nHe does think, however, that it's important for listeners to understand the source material, which means checking out Célia's original track. \"I find happiness that people are finding out about Célia and Lisa Ono because of me,\" he said. \"I love them so much.\" (Lisa Ono is a Brazilian-Japanese bossa nova artist; Freddie Dredd sampled her song \"Sway It, Hula Girl\" on his track \"Cha Cha,\" which is also a TikTok hit.) \"Go listen to Célia & Lisa Ono instead of me, broaden your musical horizons.\""},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1184217%252F3e3b6e41-3c76-46dc-9bf3-6982bf9debfa.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=aU2kCZXXa26Q6I4sjyXmbPmp6ck=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=f0jVGXv92CryrxjG-77P6HUX-Yg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=n683fqYrwKmRHHrXW1-AFgfbo_o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=GlABHkN4qVEUZ-_oUHf3bdcZwCM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=m6bvoFz3rmBxslzYl3bButH9rQI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=UuySBZzv5fHiXuu4MD29oEq2W-4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Here's what's up with the 'love, I know' song on TikTok","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=n683fqYrwKmRHHrXW1-AFgfbo_o=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=ncVMO3zoKaKzo5U-DKSux_5XMO4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=gmi2gLzxNMNnyic_6UyWwjbu4uk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=m6bvoFz3rmBxslzYl3bButH9rQI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110197%252Fc389bd71-4750-497f-bc23-93d019c3873f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=n683fqYrwKmRHHrXW1-AFgfbo_o=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Here's what's up with the 'love, I know' song on TikTok","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Yes, the lyrics are actually in Portuguese.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Here's what's up with the 'love, I know' song on TikTok"},{"_id":"5e33873628cc367df3000010","id":"/article/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-explained/","title":"Coronavirus conspiracy theories spread panic and dangerous misinformation","title_tag":null,"author":"Tim Marcin","post_date":"2020-01-31T01:47:33+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 01:47:33 +0000","formatted_date":"01/31/2020","sort_key":"1IXsp3","link":"https://mashable.com/article/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-explained/","content":{"plain":"The deadly coronavirus has spawned dangerous, baffling conspiracy theories online as officials across the globe work to stop the virus' spread. \nAs of Thursday afternoon, there had been more than 7,700 confirmed cases of the virus — which originated in Wuhan, China — and at least 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries, including the U.S., have confirmed cases, according to the World Health Organization.\nBut as bad as the virus is, conspiracy theories and misinformation are making the situation worse. The internet is rife with misinformation about the origin of the virus and how to protect yourself from it. Some of it is dangerous, some strange, and some downright racist. All of it is seemingly designed to piggyback off the intense interest in the virus. \nThere has been so much bad information out there that Twitter has started tweaking search results to filter out non-credible coronavirus content and Google has launched \"SOS Alert\" to provide reliable resources for people searching for information about the virus.\nHere are some of the most prominent hoaxes about coronavirus that are currently being spread across social media and resources debunking them.   \nThe Bill Gates theory \nThe thrust of this theory is that the coronavirus is somehow owned by Bill Gates and was unleashed for nefarious purposes. One Twitter post, for instance, racked up 1,000 retweets by linking out to a strange website running a headline claiming the coronavirus was \"a patented virus\" and that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was \"one of the primary owners.\" The tweet then pivoted to wondering if the \"deep state\" spread the virus \"to create chaos since nothing [is] stopping Trump.\"\nA similar conspiracy theory floated around TikTok last week, according to Forbes. But the Gates Foundation did not, of course, create a virus that the so-called deep state then used to infect an unsuspecting population. \nAs is often the case, there is a kernel of truth somewhere that was distorted well past the realm of reality. In this instance, the Gates Foundation helped fund the UK's Pirbright Institute, which holds a patent related to the development of a weakened strain of the coronavirus that could be used to vaccinate birds or other animals from respiratory diseases.\n\"Pirbright does not currently work with human coronaviruses,\" the institute said in a statement. \nAdditionally, The Gates Foundation foundation announced on Sunday that it would donate $10 million to fight the outbreak. \nQAnon tells people to drink bleach \nAs the Daily Beast reported, QAnon folks — a wholly false, yet incredibly popular conspiracy theory that claims President Donald Trump is dismantling a secret, vast deep-state cabal — have been promoting the use of \"Miracle Mineral Solution\" (MMS) to protect yourself against the coronavirus. \n“I’m going to have to get home, and MMS the whole state,” QAnon promoter Jordan Sather said in a recent video, according to the Daily Beast. “MMS the whole shit out of everything.” \nThe thing is, MMS is basically bleach. \n\"Miracle Mineral Solution and similar products are not FDA-approved, and ingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach,\" the FDA said in an August statement. \n\nChina expanded its lockdown against the deadly new virus to an unprecedented 36 million people. New followers protect yourself with the 20-20-20 spray.

NBC News reported the two most popular coronavirus Instagram posts were both from Karmagawa, a nonprofit that says it donates proceeds of its merchandise to charity. \n\"Both posts feature a carousel of videos, some of which show people eating animals like bats and mice and put the blame for the outbreak on the eating habits of Asian people — claims that have been debunked,\" wrote NBC News. \nExperts have warned these sorts of posts could help spread racist and xenophobic fears tied to the illness. The popular posts from Karmagawa, which has 1 million followers, have racked up tens of millions of views and hundreds of thousands of likes. \nViral racism \nAs Mashable has reported, there's an error-riddled social media post going viral that espouses racist conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. The misspelling-filled post falsely connects some Asian foods to the spread of the disease and has been particularly popular in Australia, even after it's been repeatedly debunked. \nMisleading videos of people eating bats are also being shared widely, in a racist and deeply flawed attempt to blame Chinese bat consumption for this outbreak. \n1/2 @NSWHealth has been made aware of a social media post that is being widely circulated warning people to not consume certain foods or visit certain locations in Sydney. This post has not originated from NSW Health or any related entity... pic.twitter.com/GcvM4aG4ga— NSW Health (@NSWHealth) January 28, 2020\n\nThe Canadian lab theory \nAnother popular (but debunked) theory involves a Winnipeg microbiology lab that handles dangerous pathogens. \nSans evidence, the theory posits that a Chinese scientist who was escorted out of the lab last summer sent the coronavirus back to China. \n“This is misinformation and there is no factual basis for claims being made on social media,” The Public Health Agency of Canada told the National Post. \nTHREAD: Some of my stories about Canada’s National Microbiology Lab (NML) have been distorted to create a #coronavirus conspiracy theory. One of the 1st mentions was Saturday on Twitter. Businessman Kyle Bass claimed this involved “a husband and wife Chinese spy team”: (1/11) pic.twitter.com/GfcnlBJ9Fp— Karen Pauls (@karenpaulscbc) January 28, 2020\n\nThe coronavirus isn't warfare \nA common thread for a number of conspiracy theories out there is that the Chinese government developed the virus as a weapon. As Poynter Institute fact-checking site Politifact noted, one such theory floated the idea that the aforementioned scientist in the Canadian lab took the coronavirus to a maximum security lab in Wuhan, where it eventually hit the public. \nPrepare now I believe the coronavirus was bioengineered and accidentally released from the lab in Wuhan #coronavirus— Nick Ricci (@NickRicci5) January 30, 2020\n\nBut Politifact said there just wasn't proof to back that up, \"Officials are still trying to determine the exact cause of the outbreak, but there’s no evidence of it being created for use as a bioweapon.\" \nSEE ALSO: The coronavirus has sent a video game about wiping out humanity to #1\nDebunked theories like these are a reminder that while the outbreak is concerning, you should still be careful about what you share and what you accept as fact. The coronavirus has the attention of the world, which all but guarantees people peddling disinformation will ride that wave. \nThis is a developing story..."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1177811%252Fc5dbabc6-c72f-460b-b269-28ad36fd3dc0.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=rCgRBxwzD8QbIt3M4Mzv4rPnLBo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=jh9PSTv-gbEiCGvUdqqjGMw5lRQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=kfViR27RPls-9MBSWgW8b0biMX0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=bD3mX4OZ2pCZdd624R4B_GqfLxU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=XVvumB736PwcZcgu_TQXkmE4HfU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=Qh_zJhj1QGYHuXRZ20-PbtoPTCY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Coronavirus conspiracy theories spread panic and dangerous misinformation","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=kfViR27RPls-9MBSWgW8b0biMX0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=0-6W3cZz-UcGzkw_vPYjdNizyLs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=9yx3R_o_99Kf9P2_U7XiG4sRjO0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=XVvumB736PwcZcgu_TQXkmE4HfU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F110042%252Ff5b08dee-d08e-42ca-b02c-2b95b2e40e3b.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=kfViR27RPls-9MBSWgW8b0biMX0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Coronavirus conspiracy theories spread panic and dangerous misinformation","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Fact check before you share","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Coronavirus conspiracy theories spread panic and dangerous misinformation"},{"_id":"5e29ccfd28cc363b98000005","id":"/article/poet-poem-twitter-meme/","title":"The 'poet/poem' meme is a nice way to celebrate your faves","title_tag":null,"author":"Chloe Bryan","post_date":"2020-01-23T16:42:36+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 16:42:36 +0000","formatted_date":"01/23/2020","sort_key":"1IUWKI","link":"https://mashable.com/article/poet-poem-twitter-meme/","content":{"plain":"2020 hasn't been the best for memes so far, probably because of how bad everything else is. This \"the poem/the poet\" meme is pretty good, though. At the very least, it's a pleasant ride through some notable moments in pop culture.\nThe side-by-side image format — a longtime favorite of people with sizable screenshot folders — has been particularly popular for the past few weeks. In this meme's case, it started earnestly, with writers sharing their work alongside their headshots. \nThat was nice, but this is online, so the sincerity was quickly usurped by people posting iconic quotes (\"poems\") from pop culture figures (\"poets\") like Claire Saffitz, Finn from Star Wars, and our number one boy Kendall Roy. \nAfter all, what is Succession's \"L to the OG\" if not the

Snipes and Matt Walsh in the wake of a harrowing Nutmobile accident.\nHis funeral will reportedly air during the third quarter of the game. \nOn Twitter, reactions to the nut's death were, unfortunately, mostly positive. The official platform of brain worms has never handled weird brand tweets particularly well — people tend to either play gleefully into the brand's strategy or get way meaner than a probably-beleaguered social media manager deserves — but Mr. Peanut is already divisive. \n\nIt is with heavy hearts that we confirm that Mr. Peanut has died at 104.

Don't worry: No brand would let 104 years of rocky marketing die that easily."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1164914%252F755f60c3-5504-4a22-ba41-442ec6f45aac.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=dkWbsCohryp63NEc80nm7TuRQto=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=ingbMLyukRqE315Cx-7X6KvkLAs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.png%252F356x205.png?signature=itfgpssUeqKDKirUhkaSHwbJwwA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.png%252F712x410.png?signature=BxiPyHxbwIZw2p38TAjwvrKFEks=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.png%252F280x157.png?signature=PgNMjydDkUckL4c9qvvYAoicGBU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.png%252F560x314.png?signature=BHt75bqzoR6-RWvPQtgVbTNxIQU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Planters kills off Mr. Peanut for a Super Bowl ad, and people are thrilled","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.png%252F356x205.png?signature=itfgpssUeqKDKirUhkaSHwbJwwA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=5BvT-KOtu13TKTvGMO6tuT-QGCg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=P9H2SDX2e7BPDt_nrHNA4ZaI0F4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.png%252F280x157.png?signature=PgNMjydDkUckL4c9qvvYAoicGBU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109639%252F8e6ff6c0-f024-4dc9-9f6b-a08a3fc50142.png%252F356x205.png?signature=itfgpssUeqKDKirUhkaSHwbJwwA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Planters kills off Mr. Peanut for a Super Bowl ad, and people are thrilled","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"He is in hell.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Planters kills off Mr. Peanut for a Super Bowl ad, and people are thrilled"}]
