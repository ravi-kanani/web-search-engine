        <h1> Sunday 24 March 1666/67 </h1> 
        <p>(Lord’s day). With <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, who is mighty cheerful, which makes me think and by some discourse that there is expectation of a peace, but I did not ask [him]. Here was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> also: and they did talk of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, whose <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10971/">father</a>, it seems, did give <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9471/">Mr. Ashburnham</a> and the present <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2845/">Lord Digby</a> 1200<i>l.</i> to be made an Irish lord, and swore the same day that he had not 12<i>d.</i> left to pay for his dinner: they make great mirth at this, my Lord Bruncker having lately given great matter of offence both to them and us all, that we are at present mightily displeased with him. By and by to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, where we all met, and there was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> also; and all our discourse was about fortifying of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8835/">Medway</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a>, which is to be entrenched quite round, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a>: and here they advised with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10972/">Sir Godfry Lloyd</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10973/">Sir Bernard de Gum</a>, the two great engineers, and had the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6261/">plates</a> drawn before them; and indeed all their care they now take is to fortify themselves, and are not ashamed of it: for when by and by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington</a> come in with letters, and seeing the King and Duke of York give us and the officers of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5016/">Ordnance</a> directions in this matter, he did move that we might do it as privately as we could, that it might not come into the Dutch Gazette presently, as the King’s and Duke of York’s going down the other day to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8834/">Sheerenesse</a> was, the week after, in the Harlem Gazette. The King and Duke of York both laughed at it, and made no matter, but said, “Let us be safe, and let them talk, for there is nothing will trouble them more, nor will prevent their coming more, than to hear that we are fortifying ourselves.” And the Duke of York said further, “What said <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10974/">Marshal Turenne</a>, when some in vanity said that the enemies were afraid, for they entrenched themselves? `Well,’ says he, ‘I would they were not afraid, for then they would not entrench themselves, and so we could deal with them the better.’”</p> 
        <p>Away thence, and met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a>, who tells me that he do believe the government of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> is bought by my Lord Allington for a sum of money to my Lord Arlington, and something to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a>, who (he did tell me particularly how) is as very a false villain as ever was born, having received money of him here upon promise and confidence of his return, forcing him to pay it by advance here, and promising to ask no more there, when at the same time he was treating with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10955/">Lord Allington</a> to sell his command to him, and yet told Sir H. Cholmly nothing of it, but when Sir H. Cholmly told him what he had heard, he confessed that my Lord Allington had spoken to him of it, but that he was a vain man to look after it, for he was nothing fit for it, and then goes presently to my Lord Allington and drives on the bargain, yet tells Lord Allington what he himself had said of him, as [though] Sir H. Cholmly had said them. I am glad I am informed hereof, and shall know him for a Lord, &amp;c. Sir H. Cholmly tells me further that he is confident there will be a peace, and that a great man did tell him that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Lord Albemarle</a> did tell him the other day at White Hall as a secret that we should have a peace if any thing the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France</a> can ask and our King can give will gain it, which he is it seems mad at.</p> 
        <p>Thence back with Sir W. Batten and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> home, and heard a piece of sermon, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> come, very fine, and dined with us, and after dinner with me by water to White Hall, and there he and I did walk round <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">the Park</a>, I giving him my thoughts about the difficulty of getting employment for him this year, but advised him how to employ himself, and I would do what I could. So he and I parted, and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Martin’s</a>, where I find her within, and ‘su hermano’ and ‘la veuve’ <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8607/">Burroughs</a>. Here I did ‘demeurer toda’ the afternoon … By and by come up the mistress of the house, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10975/">Crags</a>, a pleasant jolly woman. I staid all but a little, and away home by water through <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/244/">bridge</a>, a brave evening, and so home to read, and anon to supper, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> with us, and then to read myself to sleep again, and then to bed, and mightily troubled the most of the night with fears of fire, which I cannot get out of my head to this day since the last <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">great fire</a>. I did this night give the waterman who uses to carry me 10<i>s.</i> at his request, for the painting of his new boat, on which shall be my arms.</p>

         <p>L&amp;M note that the news had appeared in the Mar 9/19 Oprechte Haerlemse Saterdaegse Courant and observe that Arlington himself was "in a sense responsible for the 'leak'. His own intelligence from Holland came in part from Abraham Casteleyn, publisher of the Haarlem Courant, and was supplied to Williamson, Arlington's secretary, in exchange for similar new from England." <br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarlems_Dagblad" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarlems_Dagblad</a> </p>

         <p>Martin's certainly a tolerant fellow.</p> 
         <p>***</p> 
         <p>So there's enough cash to entrench like the Dickens but not enough to get the fleet out of mothballs at least to keep it moving from place to place rather than sitting in one well-known location.</p> 
         <p>But, hey...Those cowardly Dutchmen would never dare attack the fleet in its home base. Why it's as foolish as the idea that Japan could ever strike at some future Russian, or an American fleet, should those colonies ever become independent.</p>

         <p>Sam's now got the 17th c equivalent of a limo with driver! Scrambling up the ladder of social esteem - the pinnacle of which is to set your own coach up. But - I thought only those of rank (Baronet or above) could display arms on vehicles? Or perhaps that had not come in yet. maybe it's just a 19th c custom. Wonder if Batten and Penn have done similar deals with watermen and Sam is following?</p>
