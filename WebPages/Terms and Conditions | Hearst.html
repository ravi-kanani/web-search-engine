         <p>1.1. This Site is owned and operated by Hearst Magazines</p> 
         <p>1.2. These Terms govern the use of the Site, including participation in the Discussion Forums.</p> 
         <p>1.3. The Sites are designed to provide a forum, enjoyable for all, for the exchange of opinions, comments and information and, therefore, Hearst Magazines requires its users to abide by these Terms. Your use of the Site will constitute your agreement to comply with these Terms.</p>

         <p>1.7. From time to time, our Sites may publish articles or features&nbsp;which some site visitors may find offensive.

         <p>2. USE OF THE SITES BY YOU</p> 
         <p>2.1. Hearst Magazines or its licensors own all material on the Sites.

You agree not to use any obscene, indecent or offensive language, or to place on the Sites any material that is false, defamatory, abusive, harassing or hateful. Further, you may not place on the Sites any material that is encrypted, constitutes junk mail or unauthorised advertising, invades anyone’s privacy, encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offence or give rise to civil liability, or that otherwise violates any local, state, national or international law or regulation. You agree to use the Sites only for lawful purposes and you acknowledge that your failure to do so may subject you to civil and criminal liability.</p> 
         <p>2.4. You are responsible for all activities under your password or account, and you must keep your password confidential.

         <p>2.5. Other than connecting to Hearst Magazine’s servers by HTTP requests using a web browser, you may not attempt to gain access to Hearst Magazine’s servers by any means, including, without limitation, by using administrator passwords or by masquerading as an administrator while using the Sites or otherwise.</p>

         <p>4. USE OF THE DISCUSSION FORUMS BY YOU</p> 
         <p>4.1. These Terms have been put in place to help ensure that the Discussion Forum is a welcoming and useful resource for all users. These Terms outline what is deemed unacceptable behaviour and it is important to read them carefully.</p> 
         <p>4.2. Users of the Discussion Forums warrant and undertake that they will not:</p> 
         <p>post libellous or defamatory comments;</p> 
         <p>post anything relating to any ongoing or pending trial;</p>

         <p>post a personal insult about another user;</p> 
         <p>advertise or solicit;</p> 
         <p>impersonate another user;&nbsp;</p> 
         <p>or post material that is deliberately intended to upset other users.</p> 
         <p>4.3. We cannot and do not review every post before it appears on the Sites. Hearst Magazines operates a ‘notice and take-down’ policy, which means if Hearst Magazines notices or is made aware of a post that contravenes these Terms, Hearst Magazines reserves the right to amend or remove the post.</p>

         <p>4.9. You acknowledge that any breach of these warranties may cause Hearst Magazines damage or loss, and agree to indemnify and hold harmless Hearst Magazines in full and permanently against any third party liabilities, claims, costs, loss or damage incurred by Hearst Magazines as a result of publishing any material you submit to us, including consequential loss.</p> 
         <p>4.10. Should Hearst Magazines become aware of any activity that would be contrary to the Terms or determine in their sole discretion to be unacceptable, then Hearst Magazines reserves the right to take action including temporary or permanent removal of content, filtering of internet transmissions and/or to exclude the user with immediate effect and, where necessary, to forward any incriminating material in its possession to the UK police or other relevant authorities.</p> 
         <p>4.11. You accept that Hearst Magazines may keep a record of your IP and/or host address for reference purposes only (in order to keep a track on the amount of visitors per day). In the event of any breach of these Terms, Hearst Magazines may view and add your IP and/or host address to an ‘excluded database’ to prevent you gaining further access to the Sites. These addresses are not distributed or given out to any third party services.</p> 
         <p>5. USE OF MATERIAL POSTED BY YOU</p> 
         <p>Postings to the Discussion Forums are not private.
