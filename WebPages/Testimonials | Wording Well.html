            <p>I had the distinct pleasure of working with Lorraine Reguly as my editor and formatter on my book, <strong><em>Signs of His Light: Spiritual Lessons from My Journey with Cancer</em></strong>. She is extremely talented and definitely skilled in these areas.</p>
            <p>She was able to take my written words and correct them in such a way as to make them better, without changing the meaning of what I wanted to communicate with my reader.</p>
            <p>She was responsive to my concerns while also being straightforward and honest with her observations and comments. When changes were made, I always had the opportunity to review them and give my feedback. She delivered on her promises and completed my project earlier than the due date. Her fees were reasonable and she worked extra hard to make sure my first publication was a success!</p>
            <p>Lorraine and I connected on a level that I didn’t expect to have happen. She clearly understood my heart and I made a new friend on this journey. She is a delightful woman with whom I will work again. I highly recommend her if you need someone for your book!</p>

            <p>Her attention to detail, professional approach, and commitment to keeping my style was more than I could’ve asked for. Not only did she do a great job at helping me, she also turned this project around in LESS time than I originally anticipated. I appreciated the professionalism, responsiveness, and encouragement that I received all throughout this process.</p>
            <p>I will definitely use Lorraine again to assist me in making any future works really come to life! I definitely couldn’t have gotten this project done without her time and expertise!</p>

            <p>I am thoroughly impressed with how Lorraine edited my book, <em>Leading You Out of the Darkness Into the Light, </em>because she managed to weave the idea of walking a path and taking steps throughout it. Also, she reworked the sections to where they make more sense and are more organized.</p>
            <p>One of the happiest things I’ve done in a long time was to click the “pay now” button for her on PayPal.</p>
            <p>In short, when you hire Lorraine to edit your own work, you are getting a qualified full service wordsmith who will produce something you will be proud of.</p>

I thought it was good, but when I got it back from her, I was floored by how much better it was when she had worked her magic on it. She added bullet points, something that I had never managed to master. And, she went out on the web and found a couple of articles to link to the post. Also, she located specific information on dates and number of views of posts I had mentioned. And she added transitions that made my post flow so much more smoothly. And naturally she took her red pen to my spelling, punctuation, and grammar without taking away from my own natural writing style. I ended up sending her this email afterwards.</p>
            <p>You rock! You turned a good post into something really special. I have never had a post that is 7 ways or 9 things before. The additions you made are perfect!</p>

She is also extremely thorough and ensures that every i is dotted and t is crossed.</p>
            <p>Communication is also a strong point of Lorraine’s – she will keep you informed of what is going on, and always delivers on time. I would have no hesitation working with Lorraine again and would recommend her as an Editor to anyone.</p>

            <p>I have always been skeptical about ordering services online mostly because there is no real metric to compare the quality or decide if it was value for money. However, I took a chance and order consultancy as well as writing services from Wording Well and I have to say I am really impressed.</p>
            <p>I ordered consultancy to get help in picking up a college for my studies as well as sorting out other issues and it really helped me.</p>
            <p>I also ordered writing services as I needed help to write and proofread my SOP for the college and the turnaround time was amazing. I got the response within a day with helpful comments on how I can improve it. Overall, both the services were worth the money and helped me secure an offer letter from multiple colleges.</p>

I am a newbie to all things technical, but Lorraine’s how-to blog posts have enabled me to create better posts using new technology.</p>
            <p>She has also inspired me by writing about herself in a straightforward, no-nonsense way. She describes her struggles and pitfalls as well as her triumphs and victories. Her eBook “Risky Issues” is a fantastic read. I absolutely lost myself in her writing. And, she has inspired me to finish and publish a book of my own, “Everyone Evelon.”</p>
            <p>I have even contacted her for assistance with my blog issues and she responds in a timely manner with encouragement, support, and the right way to solve my issue. I look forward to her blog posts every week.</p>

I trust her to the point that she has my passwords and is welcome to go into my site at any time to correct problems or make improvements. Also, each time I appear online in a guest post, podcast, or interview, I tag her on Facebook and she automatically updates my “As Seen Online” page without me having to ask her to. She’s always on top of things and I love her for it!</p>

Lorraine went above and beyond the call of duty to help me get my book up and running.</p>
            <p>I was a professional sportswriter for seven years, and wrote for the largest paper in the world. But every writer needs a good editor to turn their copy from good to great. Lorraine was the perfect compliment, as her keen eye and suggestions helped transform my book into an Amazon best-seller.</p>

Initially, Lorraine performed magic on it by editing it. She organized my document into the book it is now. She divided it into chapters, with headings and titles. Also, she clarified my exercises and improved their instructions. She even reordered things in a few places, so that they would make more sense to the reader. Then Lorraine helped me create an author bio page to add to the book. Lorraine was also responsible for creating the front matter of the book (the contents of the copyright page), complete with proper attributions to the right people.</p>
            <p>I had help creating the image for my book cover, but was unsure as to whether or not I had full permission to use the image my designer selected. So Lorraine tracked down the original owner, sent her an email explaining the situation, and ended up obtaining permission to use it, provided we credited her with the copyright. It’s a great relief knowing that I haven’t left myself open to a lawsuit and that Lorraine was conscientious enough to make sure of this.</p>
            <p>When it came time to turn the ebook version into a print book, Lorraine helped me every step of the way. She solved many problems I had and then made sure each of files were perfect before uploading the different files to the various sites where my book is being sold. She ordered a physical copy and proofed it, too, because there are always last-minute changes to make. Without her help, I couldn’t have made my book available to the world as a print version. I’m grateful for all the work Lorraine did for me, and I’m proud to call myself a published author now!</p>
