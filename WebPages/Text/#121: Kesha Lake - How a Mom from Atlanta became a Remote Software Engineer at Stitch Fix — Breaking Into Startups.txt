[04:40] she was almost going into the nursing route due mainly for money when she tried doing free coding courses online and just fell in love with it. her 2019 resolution was me first! [09:32] kesha applied to four coding schools: lambda, thinkful, digitalcrafts, and flatiron school. she got preliminary acceptance from all four within 24 hours. she initially wanted to go to digitacrafts but ended up with flatiron school. this is why exploring schools is so valuable.
