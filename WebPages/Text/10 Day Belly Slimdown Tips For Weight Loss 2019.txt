to stop diarrhea? you could choose one that supports improved cognitive functioning or one that could possibly help you lose weight. figure out exactly what you want most from a probiotic supplement and this will significantly narrow your choices and reduce the stress of finding one. tip 2 some probiotic supplements may be best suited towards one gender over the other. for example, l. rhamnosus is a great probiotic for treating bacterial vaginosis. if you have a problem with this condition, you will want to choose a probiotic supplement that contains this strain or mostly this strain. tip 3 pay attention to the brand. one stress-free way to pick the best probiotics supplement is by going with a brand that has been around for a long time. you can find out more about the brands with a little bit of research. you can see if they’ve been doing research if there is any negative news or recalls on their products and if they are an ethical company. knowing that the company behind the probiotics supplement is the best company they can be and that they are an ethical manufacturer can take the stress out of choosing the best probiotic supplement. when to take probiotics the best time of day to take probiotics is in the evening before bed. the reason for this is that the food can help block your stomach acid from killing the probiotics. it is also best that you drink filtered water before you take the probiotics supplement. tap water is bad for your gut health because it is chlorinated. this kills good and bad bacteria so drinking tap water with your supplements could possibly defeat the purpose of taking probiotic supplements in the first place and make leaky gut syndrome and your stress level worse. how long does it take probiotics to work?
