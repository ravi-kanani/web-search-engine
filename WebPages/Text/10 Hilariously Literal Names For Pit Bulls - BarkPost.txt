pit bulls are notorious for violating every rule when it comes to giving others space. they will just drape their lumpy bodies wherever they please, regardless of who was there first. 3. wigglebutt monster exhibit a: source: barkfeed 4. land manatee source: @sethcasteel/huffington post manatees and pits both have whiskers and huge smiles so by that logic, pit bulls are land manatees. the end. 5. unapologetic heart thief pitties will steal your heart and never give it back, and that’s okay. pit lovers are some of the craziest, most enthusiastic dog people you’ll ever meet, and it’s easy to see why. once you have your first pit kiss, it’s all downhill from there, folks. your life is just never the same after that. 6. pitopotamus source: @max_thepitbull/slapped ham some pit bulls basically look like tiny hippos, especially when they’ve had way too many treats and get glorious love handles. look at them neck rolls. swoon. 7. nosy mcnosypants doofusface pit bulls are great at not minding their own business. they are naturally well-versed in the art of snooping… around… every… corner… just in case you slip up and say the magic word: t-r-e-a-t. 8. tuskless walrus source: stuffonscoutshead.com/flickr for some reason, pit bulls resemble many aquatic creatures. the walrus is one of them, of course. did you know baby walruses are called puppies? #science 9. head of the itty bitty pittie committee you guys, the only thing better than a pit bull is a tiny pit bull. if you’ve got a baby pittie in the family, then that cute mutherpupper deserves to be crowned head of the itty bitty pittie committee, at least until it grows up and starts pushing you off the bed. 10. house seal source: @the_blueboys/the guardian baby seals are also called pups, and their big eyes and rounded foreheads make them the pawfect doggelganger for pit bulls. did you know some people call their pits’ coloring “seal”? it’s just another word for deep brown, like chocolate. #themoreyouknow what do you call pit bulls? let us know in the comments below! 😀 featured image via @the_blueboys comments want to read more stories?
