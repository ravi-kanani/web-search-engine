seriously. at this moment in time, what are you stressing about? is it something that happened a couple of days or even years ago? is it something that you are planning on taking place later this year or even five years from now? what about today? what is going on in your life right now that you need to be thinking about? if you say you are just excited to eat dinner with your family or meet with friends after work, i’ll call you bluff. unfortunately, most of us spend too much time stressing about things in the past or future to really enjoy the time we are present with friends and family. sometimes, we build our hopes up so high that everything is supposed to happen a certain way, and as a result, we get frustrated about what new situations are and what they aren’t: what you’re used to. that’s just it. the concept of change can be scary. transition, adjustment, moving forward… all of these things equate to taking an unfamiliar step into a new direction we can’t predict the results of. so what do we do? we live for today, enjoy the people in our lives, and take baby steps, day by day. we see how everything turns out, and the smart ones do so without those preconceived expectations in tow. the wise ones accept change, take situations for what they are, and move on. they find and create their own happiness by enjoying every today and living in the present! • thinking reality television is reality i can’t help but to tune into keeping up with the kardashians every now and then. it’s a guilty pleasure i absolutely hate admitting, but i find their family so intriguing. do i think they live anywhere close to reality or have even a glimpse of what “real life” consists of? not at all. they have a television show and fame for literally existing. that’s it. and, that’s not reality. please remember that the next time you watch anything filed under the “reality” category. • thinking blogs or social media channels share everything please see my post on in-person vs. online relationships if this one gets you. in summary, the biggest misconception online is that our lives are perfect. newsflash: they aren’t, and nobody posts the bad stuff! who wants to hear you complain or continuously point out the negative things about your day? nobody. so, nobody talks about it. • planning your life to the tee you can plan your life and set timelines towards major life goals and accomplishments all you want, but that doesn’t mean life is just going to happen that way. of course, some of the decisions we make affect the outcome of certain situations, but we’re talking about the bigger picture here. as someone nearing her 30th birthday, take it from me: timelines are silly, and, in my opinion, borderline immature. who are you to say you need to be married by 25 or wrap up having your children before 30, most likely as someone in their early twenties? i absolutely love everyone i tell this to, and i have said it time and time again: stop deciding what and when things will take place in your life. what happens when your perfect little plan doesn’t pan out? regret? second guesses? depression? none of that sounds like a great time. you just have to let go, (let god do his thing if you’re a believer!), and let life happen. set goals, not deadlines! • ignoring relationships whether the relationship is with a spouse, family member, or friend, it is important to nurture any relationships you have with the ones you love. is there someone out there you wish you talked to more? are you too busy to pick up a phone and give them a call? we all are. nobody gets too far on this walk in life completely solo. there comes a point where we all crave community, and having one you can trust requires work, just like any relationship or marriage. don’t fall prey to the “i’m just to busy” excuse. everyone is “too busy!” • making excuses speaking of making excuses… you should probably go ahead and give those up. really. how far does validating not hitting your goals get you? you couldn’t finish your homework because your dog ate it? (that’s obviously the only clear explanation.) you don’t have time to fit in a workout? (that’s only up to you.) if you want to keep moving forward, you have to stop making excuses and make a plan! • knowing you’re always right opinions are like belly buttons… everybody’s got one. after being married for almost four years now, i have realized that agreeing to disagree is a beautiful thing. there are just some things you are never going to agree on. i’m sorry to break it to you, but chances are… nobody reading this is perfect. you’re going to be wrong every now and then, so you might as well accept that and embrace the opportunity to learn from disagreements when they arise. your opinions might stray from others. you might believe you are right, no matter what the others are telling you. take a step back, appreciate opposing thoughts, and relish in the fact that one of you (most likely) is right. do you really have to fight the subject to death? do yourself and your loved ones a favor and check your ego at the door when you walk into relationships. • thinking you need to impress others i recently walked into an environment where i was one of the only people in the room not dressed to impress. while others were wearing heels and short dresses, i sported an oversized top, jeans, and sperrys proudly. i just wasn’t there to impress anyone. i wasn’t disrespectful, and in fact, i made fun of myself a few times in front of others to acknowledge that i was in the minority there, but when it all came down to it, it didn’t bother me. i know for a fact that this wouldn’t have been the case a few years ago! girls are funny. we get dressed up for a night out on the town, but it’s usually not to impress the opposite sex. the motive is either to feel good about ourselves (and if this is you… go for it, sister!), to impress our friends, or even to simply post a cute picture on instagram. can i let you in on a little secret? i was probably one of the few people who didn’t buy a new outfit to attend this event, and i still had a great time! only dress to impress for yourself. • living up to other peoples’ expectations it breaks my heart when i hear people talk about degrees and occupations someone’s parents’ or spouse pushes them to achieve. support is one thing, but if you put your future on the scale of someone else’s hopes and dreams, you might be setting yourself up for failure. if your drive isn’t connected to what you are doing, where is the motivation coming from? them? call me crazy, but that, dear friend, might just be a fancy way of nagging. set and achieve goals that are important to you! stop worrying about what others think (see point above) and live and work towards the dreams that really matter to you. *** in summary, happiness isn’t just a choice, it’s your choice. if you are guilty of any of these things mentioned above (and, believe me, i have been there too!), break them now before they become habits. only you can choose the path towards your own happiness! recent coffee talks: • keeping it real (vlog) • in-person vs. online relationships • creating who you are • moving past what doesn’t matter • getting past making excuses • tips for staying motivated …and more on the coffee talks page! no related posts. about heather heather is a blogger, studio manager, nasm-certified personal trainer, and new mom living in new york city. life in leggings is a personal healthy lifestyle blog that follows her adventures in the city and helps others reach their goals by sharing quick and healthy meals, challenging workouts, and everyday fitness tips. thanks so much for stopping by! « weekend snapshots, shorts, and soup what i ate wednesday #85 & black lotus brewery » comments lake shore runner says april 14, 2015 at 10:25 am thank you for these great reminders! it is always great to have these written down to bring to light and remind yourself of things to keep you happy. great post heather! brought a smile to my face. happy international moment of laughter day! reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 12:47 pm thank you sara, and how appropriate! i had no idea 😉 reply hayley says april 14, 2015 at 10:36 am spot on. i just wrote a post about planning everything in your life and how it sucks haha all of these are great reminders! reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 12:48 pm i used to be very guilty of planning. eventually, i realized that what happens in life is out of our control. the sooner we accept that, the better off we’ll be! reply ashley @ my food n fitness diaries says april 14, 2015 at 10:38 am excellent reminders! i think we all have been a little guilty of these here and there because well, we’re human, so to be reminded of them is great. i’ve definitely improved in these areas with age and life experience, but every once in awhile one or two of these creeps in and i have to tell myself to snap out of it and remind myself of all the blessings in my life. reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 12:50 pm very true! it happens to all of us. and you’re so right… we’re human. it’s okay to snap every now and then! it’s just nice to have reminders to get us back on track! reply lauren says april 14, 2015 at 11:22 am love this post. with online it’s especially easy to compare. even when people are trying to be real you know they sugar coated it a little bit and posted a photo or whatever that they still liked! reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 12:51 pm definitely! it takes a lot more effort and heart to actually admit when things aren’t perfect. i always appreciate posts and bloggers to include a glimpse into “real life” every once in a while. 😉 reply katie @ live half full says april 14, 2015 at 11:23 am i agree with this post 110%! thanks for the great reminder. i like to remind myself “you do you” on a regular basis. that’s all you can do, no need to worry about the past or what other people are doing. just do what makes you happy! reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 12:52 pm i like that. you do you, girl! <3 reply erin @ her heartland soul says april 14, 2015 at 11:35 am i love this post so much!! so much good perspective. happiness is our choice! and that is a beautiful thing! reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 12:52 pm amen! such a beautiful gift. reply jessie @ just jessie says april 14, 2015 at 11:40 am these are all wonderful reminders! i’ve been working hard the last year or so to really try to have a positive outlook on life and, while i definitely fall sometimes, i love trying to be as positive as possible! happiness is definitely a choice and it’s something i choose to strive for. i especially love the one about living in the moment. that’s definitely something i struggle with – i’m a future girl. when will i get married? will i even get married? will i ever even have a boyfriend again? what about this? what about that? it’s exhausting! that’s definitely something i need to work on. even my job is based in the future – i’m an event planner – can’t get away from it! 🙂 thanks for writing this, i love reading posts like this. reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 12:55 pm ha, i was too! guilty of everything i mentioned in that point. i did get married, but i still questioned things afterwards and asked when this and this will happen. it’s a battle you’ll never win or get answers to! it’s exhausting is right. we’re much better off seeing where life takes us than trying to plan every little detail. just try to stick to event planning and leave the life planning out of your hands! 😉 reply emma @ life's a runner says april 14, 2015 at 12:19 pm i love everything in this post, but especially the “living in the present” one. i have so definitely been living in the future – i’m so excited to go home in 2 weeks, and not have to deal with awful roommates / school stress, but i should really just take a step back and appreciate everything i do have here! tons of close friends, nice weather, and independence. 🙂 reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 12:55 pm aw, i bet. i remember those times too. enjoy the time in school while you’re there! i’m sure people tell you that all the time, but it’s so true! reply shelly says april 14, 2015 at 12:28 pm great reminders! reply ashley @ a lady goes west says april 14, 2015 at 12:48 pm oh heather, how much i try to live in the present, and it’s so not easy. 🙁 reply fit life pursuits says april 14, 2015 at 1:32 pm these are so true and it has taken me a while to learn a lot of these lessons! now at 30 years old i have to say that i have finally moved past it all and am much happier! reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 4:42 pm me too! awesome, lindsey 🙂 reply jenn taggart says april 14, 2015 at 2:24 pm new to your blog and today this really resonated with me thanks for putting it out there for me to remind myself and teach my girls what i sometimes forget reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 4:41 pm welcome, jenn! thank you for reading, and i’m so glad you enjoyed the post. <3 reply pretty little grub says april 14, 2015 at 3:52 pm love, love, love this! i think i need to remind myself of a lot of these points often though. getting caught in the comparison trap happens easily especially with other bloggers. but i try and remind myself i don’t post everything and neither do they. they have crappy days too. reply heather says april 14, 2015 at 4:42 pm oh girl, it does. you just have to keep telling yourself that. everyone is human. everyone struggles and has bad days, just like the good days shared online. 😉 reply brittany says april 14, 2015 at 6:21 pm great tips we all need to remember sometimes 🙂 reply heather says april 15, 2015 at 12:47 pm thanks brittany! reply beautifullygrayblog says april 15, 2015 at 8:49 am this post is really great. i needed to read this today! reply heather says april 15, 2015 at 12:48 pm aw, thanks so much for reading. <3 reply kimberly says april 15, 2015 at 2:56 pm thank you for this post! i’m usually very positive and a “live in the moment” type of person, but this week i’ve been focusing on future stressors (job changes and paying for grad school in the fall) and feeling uncharacteristically down. this was a good reminder that happiness is a choice, not something that just “happens” to us. reply heather says april 16, 2015 at 12:39 pm thank you for reading, kimberly! job changes and financial commitments are definitely stress-worthy. but, you just have to take it one change and day at a time. we all have our good and our bad days, promise. you have a choice to wake up in a good or bad mood every day! 🙂 reply ellen says april 15, 2015 at 4:26 pm i totally agree with all of these. i’m personally really bad at living in the moment… and not planning obsessively. but i’m working on it! (and it is making me happier, even if it’s hard.) reply heather says april 16, 2015 at 12:37 pm it’s a struggle a lot of us deal with. planning is natural in our nature, so it’s hard to let go of control. but, the sooner you realize it’s not all in your control, the more at ease you will be with wherever life takes you! reply mandy says april 18, 2015 at 3:50 pm i definitely reheated my coffee before reading this! so, i was just thinking about buying a new outfit for an alumni event next weekend. i’ve lost weight and could use some smaller clothes, but this has reset my concern about impressing people while there. why not focus on having fun instead? thanks! reply heather says april 20, 2015 at 10:27 am aw, hi mandy! thanks so much for reading. congratulations on the weight loss! i say dress however makes you feel confident, like your best you. you’ll have fun no matter what you end up wearing! reply jenny @ support your beauty says august 31, 2017 at 2:57 am hi heather, these things exactly tell me who am i right now. that is why i always have confusions and doubts. i am always holding back and take things for granted. i want to say thank you, for touching people’s lives. this blog is an inspiration. i want to wake up every morning with positive thoughts and focus only on the present. thank you! reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment notify me of followup comments via e-mail name * email * website current ye@r * leave this field empty welcome follow facebook google+ instagram pinterest twitter follow search stay in the loop with newsletter updates and exclusive promotions! email address: categories categories select category anniversaries appetizers aspen & cali auditions baby bachelorette party baking barre beauty beautycounter bible quotes blogging blue diamond books breakfast bridal party bridal shower broadway bucket list budget cardio casseroles causes celebrations charities chicken circuit training classes classpass coffee talk coffee talks & thoughts concerts conferences countdowns cpt culture dance day in the life decor desserts detroit dining in michigan dinner diy entertainment faith fall family faqs fashion fashion favorites fitness fitness fashion food friday favorites gifts giveaways grocery hauls group fitness guest posts hair hair & beauty tips half marathon training halloween health healthy eating holiday gift guides holidays home honeymoon interviews lean beef lil baby lil giveaway week lil workout wednesdays looking back lunch makeup mimm motivation moving nails nasm new jersey new york new york city news no bake recipes on-the-go organization orlando pastas photo dump pregnancy press projects q&a races random thoughts and things recipe recaps recipes reviews roadie round-ups running salads scott side dishes skin smoothies snacks soups sponsored sports spring stitch fix summer surveys thanksgiving things i’ve learned in my 30s thinking out loud thought of the day training travel turkey tutorials uncategorized vegan vegetarian vendors videos wedding wedding hints wedding recaps weddings weekend in photos weekly workouts wiaw winter words of wisdom workout roundups workouts yoga twitter tweets by @lifenleggings pinterest copyright © 2020 · foodie child theme on genesis framework · wordpress · log in copyright © life in leggings 2020 | designed by murnan creative
