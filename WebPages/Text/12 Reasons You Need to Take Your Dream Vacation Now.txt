(thank you, ryan!) then we got to know one another, and we stayed in touch. the power of pictures ryan and i remained in contact on facebook and other social media. if you know him at all, you‚Äôll know that he often posts pictures he‚Äôs has taken while traveling the globe. often his images are of beaches and palm trees‚Ä¶ which totally fits with my dream vacation! his images of my fantasy life slowly seeped into my brain. i was jealous of him. he was living my dream! (how dare he!!!) plus, everywhere i looked, i saw ads for his other e-books (which i‚Äôll admit, i never purchased, although i read the free ones). but‚Ä¶his e-book covers always featured pretty pics of a tropical paradise. eventually, his pictures (plus the ones i had in my head) started to have an impact on me. i have always wanted to have a taste of paradise! the surprising thing about my recent trip is that it was not planned. at all. my trip to paradise was never planned seriously. in january 2016, my computer was hacked. i fell victim to a scam. yeah, me. smart, beautiful, intelligent me. i‚Äôm almost ashamed to admit this. but i told the full story on carolyn‚Äôs blog, in a post called a true story of a computer scam and how to avoid it happening to you. because i‚Äôm all about helping others, despite what i‚Äôve been through. as i was enduring the two ‚Äì count ‚Äòem, two ‚Äì nightmares i mentioned in that post, i was also under a significant amount of stress. my parents, who have lived in their house for 40+ years, decided to sell my childhood home. mainly because my mom broke her arm, and can no longer navigate her bathtub. because i had been taking care of my mom (which involved cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping for her, doing my parents‚Äô laundry, changing the cats‚Äô litter box, etc.), i was tired and worn out. not to mention stressed, as i had to stop working for a bit. i simply didn‚Äôt have time to work. the many stress factors in my life got to me. the power of facebook one saturday evening in february, i went on facebook. (it was saturday, feb. 20th.) i had received a message from my brother. he informed me that he and his girlfriend were going to punta cana for a week. they were leaving on tuesday, feb. 23rd. punta cana is in the dominican republic, a primarily spanish-speaking country. my baby bro sent me a few links to check out. so i did. gosh, it looked beautiful there! i wanted to go. i wanted to live my dream. i wanted to relax. i wanted the stress to leave my life! but, i had just finished paying off my credit cards, and so i didn‚Äôt really have the funds to go with him‚Ä¶ unless i charged it. now here‚Äôs the thing. i had just gotten my passport in january. i had never traveled anywhere outside of canada or the usa before. since getting involved with and using positive affirmations, i started visualizing some of the things i want. the cool thing is that i saw results, too. (visualization works!) my life had been moving forward for a while. and that saturday i went on facebook? i had just taken my nephew swimming to an indoor pool that had a palm tree painted on one of the walls. while relaxing in the heated waters, i stared at that palm tree and wished i was on a beach somewhere. i took my brother‚Äôs message as a sign. i was destined to go on this trip. my brother and his girlfriend have both traveled before. they were experienced, they had done all the research, and i knew i would be safe with them. they had even checked the weather forecast for punta cana for the following week. it was expected to be 28 to 32 degrees celsius all week long, with no rain. that‚Äôs about 82 to 89 degrees fahrenheit. and it was averaging -17c (or about 1.4f) in the city where i lived. i decided to throw caution to the wind and use my credit card to charge my trip. why not? it was an opportunity of a lifetime, to me. so i did. i went to the dominican republic for an entire week we left early tuesday morning, as planned. the flight was a direct one, and took about 5 hours. i had no problems passing through customs. none of us did. the package i purchased was an all-inclusive package. it included all hotel costs, air fare, taxes (including the tax you have to pay just to leave the dominican republic!), all food, all drinks (yep, alcoholic drinks!), and all other taxes. it was a sweet deal. preparing for my dream vacation was tough i had two days to prepare for this trip. i bought bug spray (i don‚Äôt like bugs), three containers of sunscreen (i burn easily), and a visor/cap. i dug out my summer shorts and tops. i packed a few dresses, a dressy pair of sandals, and my flip-flops. i gathered my toiletries, contact lenses, and make-up. i selected a few books to read. i thought i‚Äôd have hours to spare. i read reviews about the hotel. i printed off some useful spanish travel phrases. i didn‚Äôt have time to buy a spanish/english dictionary, but i had taken a course in conversational spanish when i was dating my son‚Äôs father (he was from the honduras) and i remembered some of the language i previously learned. i was set. and i left my laptop at home! (yeah, i couldn‚Äôt believe i did this, either‚Ä¶) üòâ but i brought my phone charger and smart phone. üòâ i got to see palm trees! (among other things‚Ä¶!) checking into the hotel was relatively easy. i had requested that my room be close to my brother‚Äôs. we were given rooms across from one another, which made communicating during the trip really convenient. plus, i used his safe to store my valuables. (no sense paying for two safes when one sufficed!) the resort was beautiful. we stayed at the blau natura park eco beach resort & spa. the blau was laid out quite nicely. and our rooms were centrally located. it was a hop, skip, and a jump to the pool and beach. it was the same distance to the main restaurant and bar. our rooms were also on the main level, which made things easier for me. (i am a bigger girl and have a bit of a mobility issue. i nearly lost my leg in a bad accident in 2005.) how taking my dream vacation changed my life 1: i became rejuvenated. 2: my attitude changed, for the better. i became positive about everything! 3: i became more productive. i now work smarter, not harder. 4: i started learning a new language: spanish! (no easy feat when you‚Äôre an adult, even though my son is half-spanish and i took a college course in conversational spanish years ago.) 5: my sexual drive has returned. (yep, seriously, folks. for a single gal like me, this is huge!) 6: i am meeting new people in different ways now. easily. much more easily than before! 7: i‚Äôm not afraid of trying new things, or stepping out of my comfort zone. i even went zip-lining when i was there! 8: i created memories that will last me a lifetime. and i took over 1200 pictures to remind myself, lest i should ever forget! 9: i now have a desire to be the best version of myself that i can be. (even though i‚Äôve accomplished a lot already, i‚Äôm nowhere near reaching my point of self-actualization.) 10: i am more active and am eating better. ergo, i‚Äôm healthier. and happier. (much happier!) 11: i went from ‚Äústressed out‚Äù to ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù in seconds. (the moment i saw the beach, all worries left me. i didn‚Äôt think about problems, work, family, or‚Ä¶ anything. instead, i was at one with nature, and a bit shocked that for seven full days, i would be able to live out my dream!) 12: i would‚Äôve regretted it forever if i didn‚Äôt jump at the opportunity to take this vacation. i just know it. and you will, too. 12 reasons you need to take your dream vacation now 1: you will become rejuvenated. 2: your attitude will change, for the better. you will become more positive! 3: you will become more productive. 4: you will improve your language skills. you might even learn a new language! 5: your sexual drive will be enhanced because you are so relaxed. 6: you will meet new people. 7: you will stop being afraid of trying new things. 8: you will create memories that will last a lifetime.
