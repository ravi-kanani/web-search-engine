ago, the wonder of tech published a guest post entitled 3 ways to avoid social distance in the age of technology. during those two weeks, life has changed dramatically around the world due to the global coronavirus pandemic (also known as covid-19). now, with social distancing being the best defense against spreading the virus, we can look to tech tools to help us deal with our new lifestyle. whether you’re in social quarantine, on lockdown, hunkering down, or otherwise trying to separate yourselves from others, you can enlist tech to help. contactless payments as you try to distance yourself from others, you’ll probably need to head to the grocery store, pharmacy, fuel station, or other retail establishments at some point. one way to avoid germs on a credit card terminal keypad is to use your phone and/or smartwatch to pay. if you haven’t yet done so, set up apple pay (iphone) or google pay (android phones) by adding a credit or debit card. when you check out at a store, look for the contactless payment symbols so you can pay without ever touching a keypad. online shopping/local delivery better yet, if your local stores offer delivery, take advantage to avoid being around crowds or waiting in long lines. check stores’ websites as more stores have begun to offer delivery services during this outbreak. or see if a local store has curbside pickup for items you can order in advance. consider ordering online for items that may have sold out in your local stores. major retailers may still have supplies you need that aren’t available in your area. beware of online listings that promise false claims or engage in price-gouging to take advantage of others. video chats replace in-person visits with video chats using zoom, facetime, facebook messenger, whatsapp, skype, echo show, or other video chatting service. check on friends, relatives, and neighbors with face-to-face contact using the internet instead of in-person. fight social isolation by calling a friend you haven’t spoken to in a while to catch up and see how they’re doing during these challenging times. social media connect with friends on social media, post updates to reassure others that you’re hanging in there. share scientifically-based articles you think may help others understand the situation and cope. ask your friends what they’re doing to spend the time. if you’re new to working from home, ask others who have been doing it for a while about what tips they have for success. discovering shows and movies to watch if you’re stuck at home working, studying, and/or trying to keep cabin fever at bay, check out movies and tv shows you’ve been meaning to binge-watch. ask your friends for recommendations, but be sure to specify which genre you’d prefer, uplifting vs. dystopian. what’s the best thing to watch on netflix or amazon on a social distancing saturday night? want something uplifting and not violent. — karen tumulty (@ktumulty) march 15, 2020 no need to
