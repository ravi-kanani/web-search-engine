hah! my charketorie board consisted of: 4 types of cheese slices 1 laughing cow light swiss wedge (spread on cucumbers is so yummy!) guacamole cucumber slices norwegian crispbread i loved this charketorie board because it allowed me to have a bunch of different flavors and textures and every option was low carb. side effects the only weird “keto flu” symptom i felt was nausea yesterday. i was so nauseous all day but i’m not sure if it was keto related. whatever it was though, oh my goodness i thought i may puke almost all day yesterday. nothing i can’t handle though and the symptoms are gone today. workout in the past couple days i’ve only hit the gym once for a cardio session on the elliptical. yeah i could have done better but i also have been so darn swamped at work and after work and life happens! macros / nutrition i have been able to stay under or around 25 net carbs just about every day with the exception of tuesday night when i went to the cubs game where i had to indulge in taco tuesday and i’m the kinda girl who can’t turn down a good taco (or two). side note, if you’ve ever been to padre’s stadium you have to try their steak tacos. unreal. mind blown! the tacos are made by a restaurant called lucha libre. i just found out they actually have restaurants in the area too and i definitely have to check them out again when i have another taco craving. the “special sauce” is oh so good. ketone levels my ketone’s level have sitting around the trace (.5) level and sometimes up towards the small level (1.5). i guess my tacos and few indulgences have been keeping me from the moderate level. hopefully i can get to that sometime this week! game face is on. to test this, i’m using strips called ketone script. you just dip a strip in your urine and after 40 seconds you can see your ketosis levels. so simple and the bottle comes with 150 strips!! this little bottle was less than $7 bucks and will last me forever. my current measurements / weight ewww the worst part has arrived. this is when i shamelessly tell you my weight and pretend like it never happened. let’s look at my keto weight loss after just one week. starting weight: 158.8 lbs today’s weight: 154.6 lbs weight lost on keto diet: down 4.2 lbs. as i expected from my few lax days i’ve had and my tacos at the cubs game, my weight only went down very slightly. to be honest i feel like i’ve been living a very normal life and happy that i have been able to even lose any weight with the relaxed keto diet i’ve been doing and the minimal amount of workouts i’ve had. also, i work from home so my exercise levels are very low if i don’t actually work out so it’s pretty great that just diet is enough to maintain or slowly lose. overall thoughts of the keto diet experiment overall, as mentioned above, i’ve been doing a much more relaxed keto diet the past few days but still able to maintain my weight, i feel great and am slowly finding more and more keto food options to keep me satisfied. the ketu flu symptoms i’ve experienced are very minimal so i’d say i’m doing well overall! other posts that may interest you: yesterday – first week keto diet results next day – day 11 keto diet experiment (coming soon!) eating clean grocery list 50 funny workout tanks keto friendly recipe – bacon egg and cheese muffin recipe the best alcohol option for keto / low carb dieters filed under: keto diet, nutrition, personal tagged with: diet, keto diet, my weight loss experiement you may also enjoy: comment here! facebook wordpress please enable javascript to view the comments powered by google+. loading facebook comments ... please enable javascript to view the comments powered by facebook. leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website popular posts 1. eating clean grocery list – approved foods list 2. 101 gym quotes 3. how exercise can affect a woman’s menstrual cycle – live life active fitness blog 4. can you lose weight from hemorrhoid cream and saran wrap?
