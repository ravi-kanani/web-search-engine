(of course, that person might be you!) if you have a lot of pimples on your chest, you can play a game (or trick) on her. just tell her you created a special love message in braille for her, and see if she can decipher it! you will never awaken to screams for you to kill a spider. (unless she feels one crawling on her!) my personal benefits of having blind friends surprise, surprise, you are actually reading a guest post from max’s editor and friend, lorraine reguly. (you might have known this already, but in case you didn’t i felt obligated to tell you now, as the rest of this post won’t make sense unless you are “in the know.”) now, let’s move on. when i interviewed max last year, i learned a lot about him. max introduced me to kerry kijewski, too, whom i also interviewed. kerry is a blind blogger who loves to write and travel, and is known by two alternate names: the insightful wanderer and her headache. kerry has a blind brother, brian, who wrote a song about the perks of being blind. you can listen to it on soundcloud, at this link. just ignore the ending… it’s not part of the song! through knowing max and kerry, i’ve learned that sighted people take a lot for granted. max and kerry, ironically, taught me to see. in fact, they inspired me so much that i wrote a poem about this experience. this is the biggest benefit i’ve gained from knowing them. they also helped me with this post. (thanks, you two!) feel free to get inspired yourself by reading my blind friends taught me to see. you’ll be glad you did. your turn: please share this post. like max always says, “sharing is caring!” pin the image. tell all your friends. tweet about it. share it on facebook. and feel free to drop either one of us a line in the comments, too. we’d both love to know if you enjoyed this post. can you think of any other perks to being blind? feel free to answer, even if you’re a sighted person!

🙂 did you like the final product? maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious! reply don purdum says january 5, 2015 at 2:10 pm hi max and lorraine, wow! what a great post. love it and i appreciate your sense of humor, both of you! i sure hope you get to feeling better soon max! i just read fabrizio’s post on your book and i remembered that i needed to check up on your site and see what’s going on over here. s glad i did, i really needed that laugh!!! get well soon and i hope you are having a happy new year!!! ~ don purdum don purdum recently posted…meaning vs. messaging: 2 reasons your marketing is as cold as the weather? reply maxwell ivey says january 5, 2015 at 4:04 pm hi don’ well i’ve been a bit behind lately, and so when lorraine offered me this guest post; i jumped at it. thought it would be a great funny post for the first one of the new year. and while people like reading my posts sometimes i think that i am a bit too focused too serious for my own good. i contributed to it along with kerry kijewski but lorraine wrote it and that is where the magic comes from. i’ve often told people that its true about everyone but even more so with blindness, when you can laugh about it then you have overcome it. man that’s a good line i got to remember that one. 🙂 i am feeling better every day. the problem with not getting enough oxygen or sleep at night is it is cumulative. you feel tired and heavy a lot of the time. its hard to keep up your exercise and more difficult to eat properly. when you don’t get your rest your body craves the wrong foods even more. i am now riding my stationary bike or as i call it the bike that doesn’t go anywhere every day. and i’m on schedule or close to it with the rest of my routine. gastric surgery doesn’t require you to be super regular but i like it better that way for my own good whenever possible. so glad to hear that you think about me. that’s one of the things about having a community. they support and encourage you when you are here and worry about you when you aren’t. thanks again and take care my friend. max ps how are you doing? how is the new year going? and i’ll be stopping by directly, maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious!

i replied when i logged into max’s account. that’s why his gravatar pic showed up instead of mine! sorry about that, and thanks again for your comment, don. if you missed it, be sure to read my “original” comment reply to you. 😉 thanks!

i know it’s tough for you to feel humorous, given all you’ve endured with not just your blindness, but your illness, too. i wish we could just be happy all the time, and not have to deal with such pain… and painful memories. i think your brother’s outlook is great, and i was happy to include a link to his song! after all, that’s why i asked you for it! 😉 lorraine reguly recently posted…“f.i.t.s.” series: featuring #freelancewriter deevra norling reply maxwell ivey says january 6, 2015 at 1:27 pm hi kerry; yes it was good to have both of the kijewskis contribute to the post. be sure to thank your brother for me for letting us include it. and i’m happy to see you are doing better about laughing at life’s bumps whether they be caused by vision loss or just ordinary parts of everyone’s life. take care my friend. xoxo max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious! reply neena says january 6, 2015 at 8:42 pm hi max and lorraine, boy – i was surprised at the end of the post to read that the author was not max. the author had me chuckling the whole way through. and you bring a new perspective to preconceived notions. that one about spiders is priceless!! neena recently posted…is your email newsletter scaring business away? reply lorraine reguly says january 8, 2015 at 7:45 am hi neena. nice to meet you on max’s blog. i am so glad you enjoyed the part about the spider. i think that’s one of my favourite parts about this post, too. 🙂 having you think that max was the author of this post is a true testament to my abilities as a ghostwriter (one of the services i offer on wording well). i appreciate that compliment very much! lorraine reguly recently posted…“f.i.t.s.” series: featuring #freelancewriter deevra norling reply maxwell ivey says january 11, 2015 at 2:52 pm hi neena; well, its not exactly the way most guest posts would be presented but it was a bit unusual to start with. most guest posts are written by one person and submitted to the blog owner. in this case me lorraine and kerry all contributed to it. i thought it was a great post and it reminded me to try to include more humor in my posts in the future. thanks, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious! reply patricia weber says january 11, 2015 at 1:30 pm this had me laughing all the way through the list. thanks for this guest post max! lorraine, it was terrific. i could so use the laugh today the humor is much appreciated. patricia weber recently posted…everyone knows someone peculiar reply maxwell ivey says january 11, 2015 at 3:07 pm hi pat; glad you liked the post. we can all use a little funny in our day. going to use this as a reminder to myself. take care, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious! reply lenie says january 11, 2015 at 1:34 pm hi max and lorraine, maybe i should add kerry in there too. i’m not blind but get nauseous if i look up so i tell people that anything above eye level is not my problem, including spiders. if they see one they can just get rid of it. saves a lot of headaches. you are a good ghostwriter lorraine since i did think this was max’ post. max, i hope you will be feeling better soon. reply maxwell ivey says january 11, 2015 at 3:15 pm hi lenie; yes this post has turned out to be advertising for lorraine as you are the second person who didn’t realize it was her until the end. this was fun. need to do more collaboration. 😉 i am feeling so much better. i knew what was happening but had to wait for the medical/insurance system to work through and get my cpap machine fixed. i feel stronger every day. when you realize i went without the breathing machine for about four months feeling this good after about two weeks is very encouraging. and i’m working on a post about doing it all or how we can’t or shouldn’t expect to. how have you been my friend. take care, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious!

reply ikechi says january 12, 2015 at 3:07 pm hi max and lorraine i was laughing the whole time. this post is great and has so much humour. i guess you are right that we take blind people for granted and this post as funny as it is does prove that fact. thanks lorraine for a wonderful post and thanks max for making me lol. ikechi recently posted…the most common excuses we make to avoid working on ourselves reply maxwell ivey says january 12, 2015 at 8:14 pm hi ikechi; yes, i don’t usually make people laugh as much as they tell me they have on this guest post from lorraine. am going to work on this in the future. glad you enjoyed it, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious! reply pat amsden says january 12, 2015 at 3:34 pm i’m glad you’re feeling better. you certainly have given us a humorous take on being blind although i suspect a blind girlfriend could be as bad or worse than a sighted girlfriend about having the right outfit. in fact my mind is already thinking of using this for a character in a novella i’m working on. reply maxwell ivey says january 12, 2015 at 8:20 pm hi pat; thanks so much for stopping by. i’ve spent many happy hours reading books downloaded from the national library services for the blind. so its fun to meet actual authors like you and kerry. if you are planning a character perhaps you and kerry could collaberate on something. i know she recently submitted a story to an anthology so perhaps she would be open to working on it with you. if there is anything i can do to help you with future visually impaired characters just email me. would be glad to help if i can. thanks again and take care, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious!

it’s amazing how people don’t let their life’s challenges stop them from enjoying the treasures of the world. stay in the game, maxwell! reply maxwell ivey says january 13, 2015 at 11:24 am hello; thanks for visiting the site. glad we could make you laugh. everyone has someone or something in their lives that troubles them. the key is how we can learn to live with these struggles. take care, max reply christine larsen says january 13, 2015 at 1:03 pm terrific stuff maxwell… love it. many years ago i read a list of ‘the benefits of being deaf’, written by a profoundly deaf man with a wicked sense of humour. a couple i remember were – ‘you don’t have to get up to the baby’s crying in the middle of the night’, and – ‘in an argument, make your best point and then take your hearing aids out’, and – ‘you’re never kept awake by the neighbour’s loud music/wild party’. now i find another humorist to match. and deafness and blindness are called a dis-ability? reply maxwell ivey says january 14, 2015 at 1:14 pm hi christine; thanks for your reply. got a couple laughs out of it. made me think of something lou ferigno’s character the hulk said while playing himself in one particular episode i remember. he was on screen as himself the death body builder and there is chaos all around. one of the other characters asked how he kept his cool during it. he said simple i took out my hearing aids. thanks again, max reply susan cooper says january 13, 2015 at 10:35 pm thanks for the fun post max. life is so much better with a positive outlook. i like the never being asked to help people move. after just having gone thru that experience i would be grateful to not have to do that ever again! 🙂 reply maxwell ivey says january 14, 2015 at 1:24 pm hi susan; i kind of thought you would like that one. one time i had to move my own stuff by myself and that’s something i never want to do again either. take care, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious! reply william rusho says january 14, 2015 at 9:56 am thank you for this post. it brings back memories to me, as when i was a young child my father went blind because of cataracts. i could see where some people might find this offensive. i saw my father go through stages of shock, denial and finally acceptance over his blindness. he too use to joke about being blind, and once told me something that made so much sense. he said people would not be offended about making jokes about their jobs, or even spouses or family; because these things are part of life. and his blindness was part of his life. by accepting the reality of it, he was able to view it in a different perspective. reply maxwell ivey says january 14, 2015 at 1:27 pm hi william; this is so great. i of course didn’t know you had gone through this with your father. but the post reflects my belief that if you can laugh at it you have probably overcome it. take care of yourself my friend, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious! reply andleeb says january 14, 2015 at 10:16 am this was a nice post and i think that many points are raise to aware us as well. i like your humor. you are right lorraine, we take a lot of things for granted. i enjoyed all your posts about kerry, max and now this one. they are not only teaching you the meaning of life, but us as well. i really appreciate your help and support that your extended. may god bless you and max i wish you all the best with your book. i am happy it’s going good. my prayers and best wishes on your way. thanks for a great share. andleeb recently posted…easy potato cutlet: #recipe reply maxwell ivey says january 14, 2015 at 1:30 pm hi andleeb; for the second time i have been reminded that this funny post has a message even if it was unintended that being to help people value and treasure their sight along with the rest of their health. yes lorraine has been a great supporter and now she also knows and is giving kerry a push. the community continues to grow and more people are helped. thanks so much, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious! reply alice says january 14, 2015 at 10:19 am wonderful list written with a great sense of humour. question, do you have a heightened sense of smell? some studies say the blind do and yet others say it varies per person irrespective of sight. thoughts? alice recently posted…spotlight on my top 6 commenters reply maxwell ivey says january 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm hello; i think for most people their sense of smell improves or does not depending upon how much they work at it or depend on it. my sense of smell is very poor but i went blind gradually over a period of many years. i think the improvement of other senses probably happens more with suddenly blinded people or those born blind. however, my hearing is especially good. of course this comes from having cautious parents who taught me the value of my hearing and convinced me not to risk it by spending large amounts of time around unusually loud noises like concerts or stereos. think the key is just like with any other physical feature people are all individuals. just like there is no one representative of ethnic or racial groups there is no one blind person. thanks for the question. i love a good conversation. take care, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious!

reply adrienne says january 15, 2015 at 9:06 am hey lorraine, good to see you here at max’s and for helping him out. my first thought was only a blind person can say these things and get away with it and as i read on down i learned it was you. hey, as long as they are okay with it then all is good right! lol!!! they were pretty funny actually, especially 14. yikes!!! max is the only blind friend that i have so it’s been a great experience getting to know him, his thoughts and feelings. i know since he’s been pretty much blind almost his entire life that this is normal for him. for those who have sight, we see this as a disability but although they can’t do things like drive, watch a movie, etc. doesn’t mean that there isn’t so much to life they still enjoy doing. they’ve just learned to do things differently that’s all. what an amazing attitude. thanks for sharing this with us and the laugh for the day. loved it. you guys have a great day and week okay. ~adrienne adrienne recently posted…2015 is officially here; are you ready to blog reply maxwell ivey says january 15, 2015 at 11:38 pm hi adrienne; thanks for stopping by. i know you are really busy, but this just shows how much you believe in what you do and how well you support your friends. guess its a good thing no one realized it was lorraine until they got to the bottom. wonder if she planned that. i do know it was a big help having her post to get me going again. still not 100 percent but much better. i know what post i’m writing for tomorrow. and i recorded my first video in six months. i also recorded some audio files for my friends who like my voice. thanks again for your encouragement. you’re a great friend. and knowing you got a monday morning laugh out of it makes it even better. have a great weekend, max maxwell ivey recently posted…16 benefits of being blind — number 14 is hilarious!

thanks for this usefull info… thank you 🙂 reply maxwell ivey says july 26, 2016 at 6:21 pm yes lorraine is a fountain of useful information and advice especially in the area of writing. thanks for your comment, max reply messe-home.com says september 4, 2018 at 1:37 am i was curious if you ever considered changing the layout of your blog? its very well written; i love what youve got to say. but maybe you could a little more in the way of content so people could connect with it better. youve got an awful lot of text for only having one or 2 pictures. maybe you could space it out better? messe-home.com recently posted…messe-home.com reply maxwell ivey says september 7, 2018 at 5:08 pm i recently updated the page to reduce the amount of text. however, i didn’t pay attention to amount of blank space. now that i know it’s a problem, i’ll go back and check it. i understand that things that don’t bother me because i read with speech will bother people who read with their eyes. sorry about any inconvenience, max reply trackbacks how bloggers can earn money by providing services: expert mastermind says: january 11, 2015 at 7:02 pm […] offers editing guest posts and ghost writing. she recently wrote a guest post for my site on the benefits of being blind that people didn’t know wasn’t mine until they got to the bottom of the post. lots of […] reply 7 tested tips for finding and making time for yourself says: february 11, 2015 at 3:55 am […] writing this post, i have published two posts on this blog this year — and one of them was a guest post from lorraine reguly on the benefits of being blind. i have had one post on the midway marketplace. i have also […] reply the little ways… | life unscripted says: february 12, 2016 at 11:11 am […] ones – boarding airplanes first, for example – but there are others. someone sent me this list, and while some of the pointers are funny (i will cover them here), others missed the mark so […] reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed. follow me on twitter like my page like my page show me some love… i accept donations from those who want to show their appreciation!
