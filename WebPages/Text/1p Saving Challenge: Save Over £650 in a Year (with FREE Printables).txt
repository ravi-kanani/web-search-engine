first created at skint dad in 2015/2016, this is the original 1p saving challenge. so many people have heard of the 52 week saving challenge. if you haven’t it’s quite simple, so let me explain. the idea behind the challenge is that you save an increasing amount per week for each week of the year. in week one you save £1, week two you save £2, three you save £3 until you’re saving £52 by the last week of the year. the first few weeks are obviously easy as you’ll have to put away £10 from your budget. however, by the end of the year, you’ll be down the total each week of £49, £50, £51, £52 (£202!!) – that’s a lot of money for any month, let alone december. if you’re skint, this can get really hard! for me, this target just seems a little bit too far out of my comfort zone. although we’d be able to make the savings initially within a few months our budget just wouldn’t stretch anymore and we’d fail. if these are the kind of targets that you’ve been looking at but feel like you’re setting yourself up to fail then think again! the challenges can be easily adapted for the skinter people of the world and the skint dad 1p saving challenge are even easier to do! happy saving – say goodbye to being skint! skint dad’s 1p saving challenge for 2020 view this post on instagram skint dad 1p saving challenge still going strong 💪 . we started back in november and have saved over £100 already by saving pennies at a time. . you can start any time of the year and be able to save £667.95 in 12 months. it’s well worth a try if you normally struggle to save. . grab you free printable saving challenge chart via the link in @skintdad bio. . #savemoney #savemoneychallenge #moneysaving #1pchallenge #skintdad #savemore #saveyourpennies #savingmoney #daveramsey #daveramseybabysteps #richdadpoordad #debtfreecommunity #moneyblogger a post shared by skint dad – ricky & naomi (@skintdad) on apr 29, 2018 at 10:21am pdt instead of trying to over-save, why not try a similar saving challenge by saving just a penny at a time (still increasing each and every day). so there are some of you saying, “just a penny? are you crazy? there’s no chance you’d save anything saving a penny a day!” but could i? well, one penny adds up quickly. in a year, you can save nearly £700 by putting just 1p away in day one, 2p in day two….you get the idea. for a normal (365 day) year you can save £667.95 and in a leap year, you can save £671.61 (like we have in 2020). how much has been saved?
