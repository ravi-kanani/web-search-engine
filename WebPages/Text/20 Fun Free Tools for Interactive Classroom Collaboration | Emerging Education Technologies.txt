dig in and enjoy! 1. twiddla (www.twiddla.com) twiddle provides a really easy to use collaborative online whiteboard. this “no setup web based meeting playground” is quick and easy – inviting others to collaborate by just hitting the green go button to start a session and then use the invite option. this app provides a great set of tools. you can easily add an image, web page, or document as a background to markup. there is a color palette tool, pen width tool, a shapes tool, and text can be inserted. there’s even a chat option built in. 2. google drive (drive.google.com) most of you are probably already familiar with google drive, which lets you share and collaboratively edit google docs with anyone else who has a google account, for free. sweet. being able to collaboratively edit documents and worksheets opens up a world of possibilities for interactive classroom activities and projects. 3. bubbl.us (that’s it …bubbl.us) this free tool* allows users to easily create bubble maps, that can be exported in various formats, saved (by exporting and re-importing them in an appropriate format), and yes … edited collaboratively. the use of bubble maps as a teaching tool has been a good practice for decades, but bringing it to a new level by enabling collaborative editing through an online tool is totally 21st century! *the basic plan lets you create, share, and collaboratively edit 3 bubble maps. 4. edmodo (edmodo.com) this multi-platform, device agnostic, kid-safe platform is perfect for active learning – share content, have a dialogue (in or out of the classroom), and even get parents involved!

11. cacoo (cacoo.com) create flowcharts and diagrams online with real time collaboration. this a very useful tool in a wide variety of academic disciplines, and being able to collaboratively edit them makes cacoo a powerful application. here’s a link to learn about and access their free academic plan: https://cacoo.com/lang/en/academic. 12. titanpad (titanpad.com) what about collaboration on the ipad? well, a number of the tools in this listing will work fine on many platforms, but titanpad is geared specifically towards the ipad. titanpad lets people work on one document simultaneously, and you can get a space for your team on your own private subdomain for free. 13. haikulearning (www.haikulearning.com) haiku is a popular education site, and it’s free for teachers – the solo plan includes 5 classes with up to 2gb of storage (with the ability to upgrade for a fee if you need more). this cloud-based app provides content sharing, assignments, feedback, grading, and more. somewhat along the lines of edmodo, haiku is a basic learning management system that provides rich tools for the classroom. 14. twitter (twitter.com) just search out a unique hashtag and you’re in business. using a hashtag and a tool like tweetdeck (also free), where you can dedicate a column to a specific search phrase (your hashtag in this case) and bam!, you’ve got a live stream of all content posted with that hashtag. collect and share research or news, create a class poem or story (one student posts to the hashtag at a time, taking turns to build out the content), search out subject matter experts and follow them, and so on. here’s 100 ways to teach with twitter. 15. minecraft (minecraftedu.com) multiplayer games can be a great way to provide an interactive, collaborative experience in the classroom. with a little know-how, minecraft players can interact. read this article to learn more about teaching using minecraft: gamifying the classroom with minecraft – the possibilities are powerful and endless! 16. economics-games (economics-games.com) here we have a purpose-built multiplayer game for the classroom. economics-games.com is a free educational games site for teaching microeconomics, industrial organization and game theory. “choose the game you want to run, enter the number of players and that's it: you just have to communicate their logins to your students and have them connect to the site with their phones, tablets or laptops. you can then observe and debrief the game through your interface.” 17. world of warcraft (wowinschool.pbworks.com) check this site out to learn all about using world of warcraft and other “mmporgs” (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) in the classroom. through this site, all project materials, including a fully-developed language arts course, aligned to middle grades standards, are now available under a creative commons license. 18. bounceapp (www.bounceapp.com) review, notate, share, and discuss any web page with bounceapp. bounceapp makes it really easy to grab a web page screen shot and make notes on it. this can then be sent to others. user can share ideas on the same site by each grabbing, notating, and then sharing their work. for a more collaborative experience, bounce will work with notableapp.com to let a workgroup collaborate (notableapp is not free, but there is a free 30 day trial). 19. wiggio (wiggio.com) wiggio is a free workgroup application that provides meetings, to-do lists, messaging, calendars, polls, and file sharing. this is a fully blown collaboration environment, and it’s free (there is a premium service, but this is really only for organizations looking for a branded workspace and priority support – the primary functionality of wiggio is totally free). 20. socialfolders.me (socialfolders.me) this is a bit of a stretch as a collaborative tool, but it’s a cool app and it could provide for a unique twist on the idea of collaboration. if you are using any of the apps supported by socialfolders, say, facebook and instagram, for group work in a course, social folders can provide the ability to allow members of the workgroup to synch selected shared content, making it a sort of collection or gathering place for group content. besides that, it’s a cool app that anyone who uses more than one social media application may find pretty darn useful (coordinate your content across multiple social media apps and back it up at the same time)!
