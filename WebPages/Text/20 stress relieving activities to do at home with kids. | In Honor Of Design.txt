($10 off coupon here.) forts are always a good idea. 8. home library ‚Äì something my younger kids love is when i set up a little home library for them. you can set up rows of books for them to choose from, have lounge areas to read, and even have a check out station.we have a play cash register with a scanner that scans their ‚Äúlibrary cards‚Äù and books they decide to check out. for library cards we use old rewards cards or they make their own. 9. home grocery store ‚Äì similar concept, except we set out all of the play food and the home kitchen with cart for them to shop and pay for groceries with their cash register. 10. dance freeze party ‚Äì it it‚Äôs raining out, we do this after dinner to get their energy out. every time we pause the dance music, you have to freeze. if you move after it pauses, you are out. last one standing wins. 11. file activity folders ‚Äì crediting this idea to my mom, who was an incredibly creative former teacher who tested all of her fun ideas when we were little. using manila folders, she would print out black and white copies of learning sheets and laminate them inside the folders so that we could re-use them over and over. pinterest has a bunch of resources for these. just search ‚Äúfile folder activities.‚Äù 12. baking clay activities ‚Äì veronica got a baking clay and bead box for christmas and is using some free time to make keychains and necklaces. we also have tried making mini foods. here is a basic baking clay kit + tools set. 13. building station ‚Äì i‚Äôve talked about these before, but we probably use magna-tiles, legos (this is a good builder set), and lincoln logs are our most used toys. if you have any of these set up a simple area with building challenges your kiddos can try depending on their ages. faces from foliage 14. painting with music ‚Äì my kids are never more quiet than when i put on a good playlist and get out some watercolors. it‚Äôs not as messy as paint, and can be washed up and cleaned pretty quickly. some good starting materials for the kids: paints, brushes, paper for you (because yes painting is therapeutic for everyone even if you think you have zero talent): watercolors, brushes, trays (you can use tupperware lids or mochi containers), paper pads 15. go for a walk, collect foliage, and make fun faces! check the hashtag #facethefoliage on instagram to see how many different ideas people have done so far. 16. at home cinema ‚Äì if you have a projector, set up a little at home cinema with tickets for popcorn or treats and cozy blankets and pillows on the floor. 17. land of dough ‚Äì ordered a few tubs of this fun sensory dough! a lot of fun options. this is another great small business you can support too! or if you want to make your own play dough we like this recipe. 18. nature hike scavenger hunt ‚Äì we are lucky to live near a small mountain hike trail so i have a list of things to look out for on our hike to turn it into a scavenger hunt game for the kids. 19. roller rink ‚Äì have an unfinished basement, garage space, or driveway? put on some music and encourage your kids to rollerblade or skate! (i used to do this with my sisters when i was little, and we would have so much fun.) 20. screen time ‚Äì might i recommend disney+? üòâ what else would you add to this list? leave you ideas below so we can all benefit from them! you may also like leave a comment (cancel) paige cassandra flamm march 16, 2020 these are all awesome ideas! i‚Äôm honestly really excited about having my kids home and just going with the flow with them! paige http://thehappyflammily.com reply kristen march 17, 2020 thank you for sharing all these ideas! we spent the weekend planning ahead as well and it‚Äôs been helpful to incorporate my own exercise (for sanity), to make sure they are helping with chores throughout the day (simple stuff, but keeps the house from becoming a dump), and letting each child ‚Äúlead‚Äù an actively each day. we can all do this! attitude is everything! reply anna liesemeyer march 18, 2020 yes so important! i love that idea to let each child lead! reply amelie march 19, 2020 thank you for these great ideas! i also like to create potato stamps and create great images with colors and stamps! they can also draw on top of them. üôÇ you can also buy textile colors and stamp on bags or shirts. reply anna liesemeyer march 22, 2020 that would be something my kids would love! reply ‚Üê older post newer post ‚Üí instagram facebook pinterest youtube bloglovin the ihod shop: clean skin care + makeup favorites happening on instagram: follow + archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 find us on pinterest: copyright ¬© 2020 in honor of design. theme by maiden sites, site hosting by flywheel powered by chlo√©digital
