(bonuses, amazing benefits, equity) are you currently looking to change jobs? in what country are you located? are your company headquarters in the same city as you? what's the cost of living where you are located? what's your gender? view all less 2018 survey questions: which option best describes your role at your company? how long have you been in your current role? do you work full-time or part-time in your position? do you work remotely? (i.e not just an occasional work from home day) how many years of experience do you have working in customer support? what's your annual salary (in us dollars)? if you had the same role in 2017, what was your salary then (in us dollars)? did you ask for a raise in 2017-2018? as of 2017, have you changed companies, changed roles within your company, or been promoted within your company? what gender do you identify as? what ethnicity do you identify as? what's the cost of living where you live? which region is your company based in? what is the approximate total number of employees at your company? what is your business model? how complex is your product or products? what is the size of your customer support team? do you receive other forms of compensation (medical benefits, bonuses, amazing benefits, equity, work from home policy, professional development, parental leave, 401k or other retirement plan options)? what skills do you want to learn or develop for yourself? if you are a manager what would you want your direct report(s) to learn or develop as a skill? view all less adapting the survey each year means we can‚Äôt provide a year-over-year comparison in some areas, but it also reflects which questions are currently top of mind for members of the community. median salary vs average salary this year instead of reporting average salaries we‚Äôll be reporting median salaries. consider three salaries: $5,000, $50,000, and $60,000. the average is $38.3k, but is weighed down by the low $5,000 figure. the median ‚Äî the middle number ‚Äî is a better representation of what a typical person earns because it‚Äôs not influenced by outliers. according to payoneer: the median salary is often much closer than the arithmetic mean to what common intuition would give for the typical salary. strangely, people, political parties, newspapers, even statisticians continue to calculate the arithmetic mean and present it as a ‚Äútypical‚Äù salary answer, when median salary would be much closer to what people want to know. now, onto the good stuff. chapter 1 what support pros earn the number of participants has grown significantly year over year: 706 people took the survey in 2018 2017 551 participants 2016 203 participants 2015 60 participants while a sample size of 706 is relatively small and the results aren‚Äôt wholly representative of what customer service professionals earn around the world, the survey helps shine a light on this growing field and enables business owners, managers, employees and job seekers to hold more informed conversations about compensation. the median customer support salary for 2018 is $50,000* 2018 $50,000 / year 2017 $47,000 / year *all monetary amounts are usd. we should emphasize that these are worldwide medians ‚Äî not just north america and europe, where salaries tend to be higher. for median salaries specific to your region, check out chapter four. the majority (96%) of survey participants work full time (30+ hours/week). for the rest of the analysis, we‚Äôll focus on full-time employees who indicated they earn at least $5,000 per year. (we made the call to disregard a few entries indicating annual salaries under $5,000 for full time employees ‚Äî these numbers are likely due to self-reporting errors ‚Äî e.g., respondents could have misread the line about annual salary vs. monthly). chapter 2 gender and ethnicity 706 participants 408 women 288 men 7 non-binary or third gender 3 preferred not to answer as in years past, the median salary for women ($50,000) is slightly lower than it is for men ($52,000)* ‚Äî not ideal, but a smaller wage gap compared to other industries in general. women make about 95% of what men earn in support in 2018, similar to what we saw in 2017. also similar to last year‚Äôs report, women earn: slightly more than men at entry level about the same as men at 5-9 years of experience less than men with at 10+ years of experience *non-binary, other genders, and those who preferred not to answer are not depicted in charts due to small sample size. this year for the first time, the survey included a question about ethnic identity. the breakdown: because most of the survey participants identified as caucasian, we don‚Äôt have enough data about other ethnicities to draw meaningful conclusions about salary differences. we also wanted to avoid oversimplification and false equivalences (e.g., comparing caucasians‚Äô salaries against all people of color, or reporting that people of a certain ethnicity are paid less when that could be due to other factors, like working in lower cost-of-living areas). chapter 3 roles, tenure and experience not surprisingly, managers make more money than people who perform only frontline support. those performing frontline support make $43,581 compared to $55,000 for those who do frontline support and management, and $70,000 for managers and other leaders who don‚Äôt do any frontline support. women make up: 63% of those who do frontline support 54% of those who manage and do some frontline support 65% of managers 54% of directors and other leaders women tend to earn about the same as men based on role (and for those only managing people, slightly higher): there are two ways we can look at how experience impacts salary. the first is by how long someone has been in their current role (their tenure); the second is by how many total years of experience they have worked in customer support. when we look at the numbers by how long someone has been in their current role, we don‚Äôt see much of a change: people tend to make $50,000-$55,000 regardless of how long they‚Äôve been in the role. when we look at salaries by years of total years of experience in support, we do see salaries tend to rise as people gain more experience. people just beginning their career in support can expect to make around $37,000 per year, with that number rising to $50,000-$55,000 after several years of experience. that number doesn‚Äôt grow much with more years of experience in the same role: even support professionals with 10+ years of experience in the same role still typically make $50,000-$55,000. taken together, these numbers imply that loyalty to a specific company does not impact salary much. it may be that switching companies tends to lead to higher salaries. in 2017, 38% of survey participants asked for a raise. about 25% of respondents were promoted. about half of all respondents didn‚Äôt receive a raise or change roles/companies. we mentioned earlier that the salaries of men and women tend to diverge with experience. the reason for the difference at 10+ years is driven by a couple factors: a higher percentage of women in frontline-only roles coupled with a lower salary for those women ($38,500 for women vs $64,500 for men) a similar number of men and women in director roles with 10+ years of experience, but those women had a median salary of $65,000 versus $100,000 for men. together, these result in the higher median salary for men with 10+ years‚Äô experience ($69,000), compared to women with 10+ years‚Äô experience ($50,000). put another way, men and women in director roles tend to make about the same. however, men with 10+ years of experience make more than women with 10+ years of experience who are in director roles. chapter 4 company data instead of asking for country in this year‚Äôs survey, we asked for region. three-quarters were from north america. customer support salaries by company region company region number of participants percentage* median salary north america 495 74.8% $55,000 europe 111 16.8% $39,000 australia / oceania 17 2.57% $49,000 asia 16 2.42% $14,700 south america 5 1.21% $27,000 middle east 5 0.76% $55,000 africa 1 0.15% $15,000 no answer 9 1.36% $53,000 *regions other than north america (with its larger sample size) are only included for reference and should not be considered representative of median salaries in those regions. north american support professionals typically earn more ($55,000) than europeans ($39,000). salaries tend to rise with cost of living: $14,805 for low cost of living areas like manila, philippines, compared to $42,500 for medium cost-of-living areas like san antonio, texas, compared to $60,000 for high cost-of-living areas like london. cost of living number of participants percentage median salary $ (e.g. manila, delhi, hanoi) 28 4.23% $14,805 $$ (e.g. tallinn, san antonio, santiago) 166 25.1% $42,500 $$$ (e.g. nashville, birmingham (us), vienna, austin, las vegas, tel aviv) 237 35.8% $50,000 $$$$ (e.g. san francisco, hong kong, sydney, london, paris, new york) 213 32.2% $60,000 this is where working remotely (more on that in the next chapter) carries the biggest advantage: living in low- to mid-range cost-of-living areas while working for companies based in high-cost, high-salary areas will maximize your spending power. companies with larger support teams tend to pay more: teams of one-five people earn a median of $47,750 compared to the $55,000 people on teams of five or more earn, and $64,328 that people on teams of 101-500 people earn. interestingly, salaries at companies with more than 500 support professionals are the lowest, at $42,562. only 10 responses came in from those companies, so it might not be fully representative of actual salaries, but that median may also be brought down by the lower salaries paid in call center organizations that employ large numbers of customer service representatives. (another potential factor is that respondents could have misinterpreted the question as company size rather than support team size.) about 4 in 10 participants work at a saas (software as a service) company. support professionals working in saas typically earn $5,000 more per year ($55,000) than those working outside of saas ($50,000). it‚Äôs true that the software industry often pays higher salaries in general, although the difference may also be due to a growing understanding among saas companies that high-quality customer support is a competitive differentiator when it comes to customer experience. chapter 5 remote work and other benefits support professionals who work remotely some or all of the time have the highest average salaries. 286 responses $48,000 never remote 155 responses $50,500 occasionally remote 194 responses $55,000 fully remote 27 responses $60,000 50% remote 2018 706 respondents 194 27% remote workers 486 73% co-located 2017 551 respondents 164 30% remote workers 387 70% co-located 2016 203 respondents 81 40% remote workers 122 60% co-located 2015 60 respondents 20 33% remote workers 40 67% co-located a comparison of remote to co-located survey participants over the years the continued rise of remote/flexible work schedules, and the good salaries to be found in those jobs, are great news for support professionals who enjoy the freedom and productivity of working from wherever they choose. medical benefits most survey respondents (72%) receive at least partial medical benefits through work ‚Äî definitely more of a critical benefit in the u.s. and other countries without government-subsidized health care. bonuses an encouraging 44% of survey respondents reported receiving bonuses outside their regular salaries. equity nearly a third (30%) of survey respondents reported some form of equity in their companies as part of their compensation package. professional development among survey respondents, 44% said their companies pay for professional development such as conferences, continuing education, seminars and books. parental leave this is another benefit that‚Äôs more critical in some countries than in others: 38% of respondents said their companies offer more parental leave than the 12 weeks of unpaid leave required by the u.s. family and medical leave act, but this is a global survey and many countries in europe and elsewhere have more generous parental leave laws than the u.s. does. retirement nearly half (49%) of customer support professionals have a 401k or other retirement plan option through work. chapter 6 desired skills the survey asked ‚Äúwhat skills do you want to learn or develop for yourself?‚Äù this word cloud represents the most common terms used in the replies: the survey also asked mangers what skills they‚Äôd most like to see their direct reports develop: live. laugh. love. help scout. email icon we make a web-based help desk for teams that insist on a delightful customer experience. more about help scout. learn to build a company people love join 251,101 people on our weekly newsletter. start your free 15-day trial you‚Äôll be set up in minutes. sign up now join 251,101 subscribers and receive the latest tools, insights, and tips on how to create better customer experiences. no thanks
