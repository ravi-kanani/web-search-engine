that's what entrepreneur set out to discover with our top franchise brands ranking. the ranking was determined by taking the companies that applied for this year's franchise 500 and analyzing factors such as social media followers, system size, number of years in business, number of years franchising, and overall reputation—and looking at how they all combine to form lasting relationships with fans. keep in mind that this list is not intended as a recommendation of any particular company. a vibrant brand is just one of many elements to consider when buying a franchise; it's critical that you do due diligence before investing in any opportunity. read the company's legal documents, consult with an attorney and an accountant, and talk to as many existing and former franchisees as you can. company advertise brand licensing contact us staff contribute reprints & licensing products women entrepreneur green entrepreneur ask an expert entrepreneur insurance franchise webinars publish your book shop editions united states india asia pacific middle east europe español georgia south africa get the magazine subscribe join our newsletter terms of use privacy policy cookies policy site map copyright © 2020 entrepreneur media, inc. all rights reserved. entrepreneur media, inc. values your privacy. in order to understand how people use our site generally, and to create more valuable experiences for you, we may collect data about your use of this site (both directly and through our partners). by continuing to use this site, you are agreeing to the use of that data. for more information on our data policies, please visit our privacy policy. entrepreneur members get access to exclusive offers, events and more. login with facebook login with google email password forgot password?
