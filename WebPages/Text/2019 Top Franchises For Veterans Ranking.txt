to find out, we invited those companies to participate in a survey designed to help us learn more about their veterans programs. from there, we developed our ranking of the top 150 franchises for veterans, taking into account each company's veteran incentive, how veteran franchisees are attracted to and supported by the company, and how each company scored in the 2019 franchise 500. please note this list is not intended as a recommendation of any particular company. whether incentives to ownership are being offered or not, it's always vital to do your research before investing in a franchise. read the company's legal documents, consult with an attorney and an accountant, and talk to existing and former franchisees to find out if the opportunity is right for you. company advertise brand licensing contact us staff contribute reprints & licensing products women entrepreneur green entrepreneur ask an expert entrepreneur insurance franchise webinars publish your book shop editions united states india asia pacific middle east europe español georgia south africa get the magazine subscribe join our newsletter terms of use privacy policy cookies policy site map copyright © 2020 entrepreneur media, inc. all rights reserved. entrepreneur media, inc. values your privacy. in order to understand how people use our site generally, and to create more valuable experiences for you, we may collect data about your use of this site (both directly and through our partners). by continuing to use this site, you are agreeing to the use of that data. for more information on our data policies, please visit our privacy policy. entrepreneur members get access to exclusive offers, events and more. login with facebook login with google email password forgot password?
