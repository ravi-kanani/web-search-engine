here’s a look behind the scenes. the five pillars of the franchise 500® some key factors that go into our evaluation: costs & fees franchise fee total investment royalty fees support training times marketing support operational support franchisor infrastructure financing availability litigation size & growth open & operating units growth rate closures brand strength social media system size years in business years franchising financial strength & stability franchisor's audited financial statements note: pillars and factors are not listed in order of importance. the ranking process begins with gathering the data. starting in july 2019, we asked franchisors to fill out our online form and submit a copy of their current franchise disclosure document (fdd) or canadian disclosure document. we had a record-breaking year, with 1,105 companies supplying all the required information. submissions were vetted by our editorial team before being entered for data analysis. to be eligible to rank, a franchisor must be seeking new franchisees in the u.s. or canada and must have had a minimum of 10 units open and operating as of july 31, 2019, with at least one franchise located in north america. each eligible franchisor was scored based on more than 150 data points, and those with the highest cumulative scores became the franchise 500. note: the franchise 500 is not intended to endorse, advertise, or recommend any particular franchise. it is solely a tool to compare franchise operations. you should always conduct your own careful research before investing in a franchise. read the fdd and related materials, get help from a franchise attorney and an accountant to review legal and financial documents, talk to as many existing and former franchisees as possible, and visit their outlets. protect yourself by doing your homework to find the opportunity that’s best for you. research compiled by tracy stapp herold and michael frazier, with assistance from sean strain, ayesha diwan, karina martinez, dianna mendoza, and niko ruiz; technical assistance from angel cool. company advertise brand licensing contact us staff contribute reprints & licensing products women entrepreneur green entrepreneur ask an expert entrepreneur insurance franchise webinars publish your book shop editions united states india asia pacific middle east europe español georgia south africa get the magazine subscribe join our newsletter terms of use privacy policy cookies policy site map copyright © 2020 entrepreneur media, inc. all rights reserved. entrepreneur media, inc. values your privacy. in order to understand how people use our site generally, and to create more valuable experiences for you, we may collect data about your use of this site (both directly and through our partners). by continuing to use this site, you are agreeing to the use of that data. for more information on our data policies, please visit our privacy policy. entrepreneur members get access to exclusive offers, events and more. login with facebook login with google email password forgot password?
