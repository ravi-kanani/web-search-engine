(2000). strengthening verbal skills through the use of classroom drama: a clear link.” journal of aesthetic education, 34(3/4), 239-275. 61(5):1617-27. source: www.jstor.org/stable/3333644 2) builds self-confidence and self-esteem a healthy view of the self is something that’s necessary to thrive, and the seeds of good self-esteem and self-confidence are often planted in childhood through engaging peer-centric activities like drama and theater education. a 2004 evaluation of the national theatre’s drama education work with primary schools demonstrated that interactive learning experiences in theater can positively impact children’s self-esteem. the three-year study followed two groups of elementary-age children throughout their engagement in drama education programs offered by england’s national theatre. these results, which focused on the younger of the two groups being assessed, determined through questioning and analysis of students and teachers that the program itself promoted self-esteem and self-confidence as a type of learning tool, encouraging children to engage with a positive view of themselves and their competency. it also increased their confidence and competence in theater and drama, with a democratic learning style allowing children to interpret their own voices as being important, authentic, and acknowledged. key study/paper: turner, h., mayall, b., dickinson, r., clark, a., hood, s., wiggins, m., & samuels, j. (2004). “children engaging with drama:an evaluation of the national theatre’s drama work in primary schools 2002-2004.” source: https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10023480 3) boosts reading achievement dramatic theater has a strong literary component, and a grasp on the written word and ability to master new vocabulary can translate into academic success across the board. the potential for theater education to improve reading achievement in students is one of the factors assessed in podlozny’s 2000 study on verbal skills and drama education. in 20 of the studies assessed by podlozny, children generally acted out or read a play or story, while a control group engaged in their regular reading curriculum. any increase in reading achievement was measured through a standardized test of reading comprehension. a demonstrable increase in the ability to recall details and vocabulary words from stories they had performed was seen in the children in the first group, with the overall efficacy of story comprehension was increased in instances where structured plots were used over role-playing.

(2000). “strengthening verbal skills through the use of classroom drama: a clear link.” journal of aesthetic education, 34(3/4), 239-275. source: www.jstor.org/stable/3333644 4) improves social skills successfully engaging with peers socially is an important component of a child’s mental and emotional well-being, and in many cases can play a crucial role in a child’s enjoyment of their school experience and overall academic success. a 2004 study by e. g. schellenberg on the effect of music education on the iq notes that children who study drama education may be more able to adapt socially, allowing them to be easily accepted by peers. interestingly, the focus of schellenberg’s study was not initially the attendees of drama classes, but groups of delinquent teens. in the study, children attending drama classes were used as control groups in helping to establish the effects of learning role-playing on childhood social improvements. after one year, the delinquent teens previously described as “anti-social” who had been given opportunities to act out roles rather than simply dictate them to others were demonstrating lower rates of delinquent behavior. likewise, control groups of students attending drama classes demonstrated significant improvement in adaptive social behavior which wasn’t seen in those simply studying music at the same institution. key study/paper: schellenberg, e. g.

(2000). “arts education in secondary schools: effects and effectiveness.” slough: nfer, 566. source: www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/91012/91012.pd 6) teaches emotional regulation the ability to maintain a calm, level-headed emotional state in the face of frustration, fear, or sadness is something that all people must cultivate, as it informs the ability to fit in socially, succeed academically and in the workplace, and avoid impulsivity. a 2013 study published in apa journal psychology of aesthetics, creativity and the arts tackled the use of expressive suppression in acting classes, noting that it can have a marked effect on children’s ability to use emotional regulation. correlational and quasi-experimental studies surrounding the emotional development of children performing in a show tied to theater education revealed that as children learn to experience emotions through acting them out, they become more familiar with emotions and how to control them in a general sense. likewise, when performing as technique actors, they must learn to disregard their own feelings and focus on their stage role, allowing them to improve their ability to self-regulate emotionally both on and off the stage.

(2000). “strengthening verbal skills through the use of classroom drama: a clear link.” journal of aesthetic education, 34(3/4), 239-275. source: www.jstor.org/stable/3333644 8) enhances self-concept self-concept, an adjacent concept to self-esteem, is something that shapes a child’s view of who they are and how they are perceived by others. it describes the notions that a person has about themselves based on self-perception and feedback, perceived or otherwise, given by peers; statements like “i’m a helpful person” or “i am nice to other people” are intrinsic to a child’s self concept. a 2006 study examining the role of drama education in self development has linked experiences with studying theater to an enhancement of children’s self-concept. in the study, over 100 children taken from five different classrooms were tested using a story task to determine their role-taking ability, a questionnaire designed to assess self-discrepancy, and a child-centric scale-based evaluation of their self-concept. these children then participated in ten weeks of drama education, after which the battery of tests was re-administered. the results showed major growth in children’s ability to take on roles, articulate self-concept, and use new vocabulary, skills shown to correlate with one another through continued analysis of these findings.

(2000). ”arts education in secondary schools: effects and effectiveness.” slough: nfer, 566. source: https://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/91012/91012.pdf 13) encourages empathy taking on roles during play has been shown to naturally increase children’s empathy, so it follows easily that drama education can have a similar effect. learning this essential skill is valuable socially and morally, and is a crucial part of character development for children. a 2012 study in the journal of cognition and development assessed the connection between theater training and increases in empathy in children, showing a positive correlation between the two. in the study, psychologists goldstein and winner assessed two groups of children — one comprised of elementary schoolers, the other, high school freshmen — as they experienced a ten month course of drama education. the study revealed that after their training, children in both groups tended to rate themselves as having improved empathy despite the fact that they hadn’t been taught to do so. they go on to theorize that stepping into the roles of other people can increase empathy and theory of mind in children by encouraging them to pay attention to thoughts and feelings other than their own.
