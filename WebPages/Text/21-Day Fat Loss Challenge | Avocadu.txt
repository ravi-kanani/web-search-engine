what if i am unable to exercise? you do not have to exercise to get the guaranteed 10-21 pounds in 21 days. if you are unable to exercise, you will still lose the weight (although, it does help). if you do decide to try the workouts, rest assured that we will walk you through every exercise, step-by-step. everyone from a complete newbie to someone with intermediate experience could pick up this program, start out, and get fast results! do i have to buy shakes, organic food, or any other hidden supplements? nope! we do have a couple of recommendations for those that want supplements, but nothing is required beyond the whole foods that are approved in the program! can i do this diet as a vegan or vegetarian? this diet is a very high-protein diet, and is not suited for vegans. if you are a vegetarian, you will have the following sources to choose from: tofu, greek yogurt, plant-based protein powder, and eggs (if you eat them). the required protein is up to 100 grams/day, so you will need to eat at least 2-3 of the sources listed above to make this plan work for you. beans are considered a carbohydrate for purposes of this diet plan, and nuts and seeds are not approved. will this diet work for me if i have a thyroid problem (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, etc.)? yes, absolutely! this program is great for those experiencing thyroid problems such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. the diet avoids all sugar, refined carbohydrates, and processed foods. there are also no other commonly known inflammatory foods such as dairy or gluten on this plan. it is a whole foods based diet of lean meats, low-carb vegetables, and a few complex carbohydrates. we have even had clients that have had a reduction in their hypothyroidism meds while on this program! does this diet work for women with pcos? insulin resistance is often the biggest problem that women with pcos face. the challenge starts out with a detox from carbohydrates, which greatly helps combat insulin resistance. the lean protein, high-fiber vegetables, and anti-inflammatory foods in this diet make it a great option for those experiencing pcos. we have many clients with pcos that have had great results from our program. can i do this challenge if i am nursing or breastfeeding? yes, absolutely! we have worked with our clients that were nursing on the challenge to come up with a few modifications to the diet that will make it work better for you if you are nursing or breastfeeding. there is a separate section just for you in the challenge with some minor modifications to make sure that you get the best results possible with no side effects or harm to your little one! what if i have diabetes or pre-diabetes? if you are pre-diabetic, this plan will absolutely work for you! we have many clients that are no longer pre-diabetic after eating on our plan for a few months. if you have type i or type ii diabetes, this plan is probably not ideal for you. it starts out with a week-long detox from carbohydrates and is not ideal for those that need to pay close attention to their blood sugar. you should always consult a doctor before beginning any new diet plan. won't the weight come back? you shouldn't experience any rebound weight from this plan as long as you continue eating a healthy diet beyond the challenge. if you ever gain any weight back (vacation, travel, weddings... we get it!), you can simply restart the challenge at any point in time to knock the weight back off! can men do this program? absolutely! we design most of our content to reach women because they make up the vast majority of our audience. but we have had tons of husbands and boyfriends do the challenge with their better half. the crazy thing is... they usually lose a little more weight than their female counterparts as well! this challenge totally works for men as well, and it's a great thing for couples to do together for additional motivation and support! is my credit card secure? credit card security is extremely important to us. that's why we've partnered with stripe to handle the billing and provide a secure socket layer, 128 bit encryption. frankly, your credit card data is much safer making an online purchase through our secure site than it is using it to pay for gas or buy food at a restaurant. so feel comfortable knowing that your transaction is 100% completely protected from fraud. meet shawna! she lost 12.6 lbs in her first 21 days of the challenge! and she has now lost over 28 pounds with the challenge!
