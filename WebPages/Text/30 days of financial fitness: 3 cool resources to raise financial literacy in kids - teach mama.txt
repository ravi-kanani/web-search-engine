there’s a money confident kids magazine for middle schoolers, which was created in partnership with junior scholastic, and there’s one for high schoolers, created in partnership with choices magazine. i simply printed the magazines, added a note to each with a few articles i thought would be interesting for maddy, owen, and cora, and i let them read! there are high-interest articles, images, and infographics in each magazine which kids really respond to. and if you’re not sure what to do with these resources on their own—if you need more ideas for discussion or follow-up—each magazine has its own teaching guide that you can use as support. so cool. also on the site is a fun heads or tails savings game where kids can literally flip a coin and see what will happen if they: simply put money they earned from a summer job into a savings account; or put money they earned from a summer job into a savings account and add $50/ month to the account. it’s worth checking out, for sure. 2.) 30-day financial fitness calendar as a person who thrives on consistency, the 30 days of financial fitness calendar made me want to dance. with a daily money-related focus that was actually manageable, i truly think that any family can be on its way to financial fitness if they follow it. with daily ideas like: start the conversation: ask kids, what do you want to be when you grow up? how much education or training does that require, and what how will that impact college savings? visit the bank: take your child to the bank and give him or her a mini tutorial. . . kid chefs, part 1: cook your child’s favorite dinner at home and keep track of the cost with him or her. . . taste the difference: give a blind taste test comparing name and generic products and explain the cost comparison between items. . . it’s hard not to want to jump right in and get started on our own challenge! 3.) the star banks adventure® app the star banks adventure app is a fun and new app for players ages about 8 years old and above. it’s a great way for kids to put to use the skills and ideas that they’re learning about how to be more confident with money. owen has given the game a shot a few times, and he said it’s a little bit of a mix of several games he is familiar with but with a totally different spin. granted, owen’s 13—and a pretty serious gamer—so star banks adventure wasn’t too tricky or challenging for him, but it kept him entertained and reading for a while. i like that this game provides yet another way to encourage us all to talk about the important concepts of financial literacy. and if teachers want to bring this game to the classroom, there’s even a “classroom mode” that allows the teacher to focus on key learning ideas and to track students’ progress. perhaps parents could even do the same for the kids in their family! love it! check out the money confident kids website for more. really, this is just the tip of the iceberg; there are dozens of other cool resources worth checking out and using either at home or in the classroom. i actually even forwarded the site to my kids’ administrative teams at their schools just to let them know these resources are available. i’m sure any educator who checks out these resources will gladly use them and introduce them to students! really, no matter the age of your children, today is the day to begin helping your kids to make financially fit decisions. it’s not even an option, friends; it’s a necessity. learn more: money confident kids—educators money confident kids—parents money confident kids—kids fyi: many thanks to the great people at t. rowe price for sharing these resources and for sponsoring this post. as always, my opinions and ideas are all my own, influenced only by my experience as a parent and educator. t. rowe price, starbanks adventure, and money confident kids are trademarks of t. rowe price group, inc. used with permission. related posts cool, interactive tool for teaching kids financial literacy cool, interactive tool for teaching kids financial literacy | teachmama.com | earn your future digital… click to learn more earth month programming for kids: resources from pbs kids my friends at pbs kids are totally ready for some fun, earth-happy on-air programming, and… click to learn more 3 cool kids, 3 cool books: what we're reading now it's hard to find books that work for your kids. i totally get… click to learn more comments comments 03 | 29 | 2019 leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website our books & freebies email sign-up: success!
