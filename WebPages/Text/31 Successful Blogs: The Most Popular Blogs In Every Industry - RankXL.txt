authority seo 2.0 blog about tools contact 31 examples of successful blogs: the most popular blogs in every industry by coral ouellette 46 comments last updated on: october 2, 2019 below is a list of examples of successful blogs. and i don‚Äôt mean successful as in they have a niche lifestyle business. each blog listed in this article is earning 6 to 7 figures in yearly revenue. some just make the cut. some are way past it in the 8 to 9 figure range. there are a few reasons why i decided to make this. first, a lot of people are unfamiliar (or unconvinced) that a blog can make a lot of money. and if you take a look at the blogs below, you‚Äôll see that they‚Äôre just normal content websites. second, i wanted this to help with niche selection. i‚Äôve found from experience that finding a blog niche is easiest when you have examples to look through. it‚Äôs not by scrolling through a long list of random words. instead, it‚Äôs by analyzing successful blogs that already exist. each example shown is one of the biggest and most profitable blogs in their given industries. 1. greatist a health and fitness blog backed by science. greatist is a blog that i‚Äôve followed deeply over the years. their focus on creating only the highest quality, science-backed health and fitness articles for millennials has paid off greatly. on the surface, they‚Äôre a regular health and fitness blog. behind the scenes, they‚Äôre a full-blown media startup with over 10 million visitors per month and an estimated yearly revenue in the 8-figure range. they make this money through ads and by selling sponsored content. what they do well: creating reputable, trust-worthy health content backed by science. this is hard to come by in an industry full of misinformation. visit site 2. nerd wallet a giant affiliate site that dominates seo in the personal finance niche. to build a website like nerd wallet is every affiliate marketer‚Äôs dream. they are the leading example of a successful seo blog that crushes affiliate marketing, and they‚Äôre doing so in one of the most profitable (and competitive) industries in the world ‚Äì personal finance. nerd wallet reviews everything from credit cards, mortgages, insurance, and all things finance. the affiliate commissions for financial products like these can get into the hundreds of dollars per referral, which is why they‚Äôre worth over $500m. what they do well: understanding search intent and creating the best type of content and user experience depending on the keyword. visit site 3. nomadic matt a travel blog with strong personal branding. there are a ton of travel blogs on the internet. most are personal blogs. they write about their travels and build up a small audience over time. nomadic matt also started as a personal blog about his own travels. today, he‚Äôs built up a huge resource with everything you need to know about travelling. what‚Äôs crazy is that it‚Äôs still a personal blog with only one main author. even to this day, he writes most of the content himself. and he ranks for nearly every keyword based around travel you can think of. there aren‚Äôt many single author blogs out there that grow to this size. it takes an incredible amount of time, focus, and persistence to continue pumping out content like he does. what they do well: diversifying income streams by creating and selling their own products. staying small, lean, and extremely profitable. visit site 4. nerd fitness health and fitness advice for nerds and ordinary, everyday people. steve kamb started nerd fitness nearly 10 years ago when he noticed that there were a ton of health and fitness blogs, but nothing catering specifically to him. so he decided to build it himself. instead of targeting anyone and everyone, his blog was directly for‚Ä¶ nerds! the interesting part is that the definition of the term ‚Äúnerd‚Äù evolved as the site grew. at first, his audience consisted of people like him ‚Äì nerds who played computer games and just wanted to get fit. today, his brand has grown into a massive community of regular people who just want to learn how to get fit and have fun doing it. what they do well: differentiating themselves from all the other health blogs by going extremely specific in their audience targeting. visit site 5. art of manliness honest tips and tutorials for becoming a better, more centered man. i first heard of the art of manliness after listening to a mixergy interview. they are a true content site, producing mainly informational blog posts around men‚Äôs interests and lifestyle topics. they make money through ads, and they‚Äôve later started selling physical products like mugs, t-shirts, and posters. usually, branded physical products can only work when you have a loyal audience, which obviously they have because 30% of their traffic comes is direct. what they do well: great branding, original design, and sticking to their origin topics of content even a decade after existence. visit site 6. css tricks a giant design and development resource centered around one big influencer. chris coyier is one of the most well-known designers on the internet. and it‚Äôs all thanks to his wildly popular design blog, css tricks. like nomadic matt, a large percentage of the articles are written by chris. he started the website in 2007. at the time, it was purely about css ‚Äì hence the name. today, it‚Äôs grown into a huge resource for all things web design and development. i visit this site several times a month myself, mainly to copy and paste in css lines that he shares in his blog posts. what they do well: using his existing audience to launch new products/companies. for example, his website codepen now has 1m users and traffic is double that of css-tricks. visit site 7. the penny hoarder a finance content site that teaches people how to put more money in their pockets. the penny hoarder is a blog around money. their mission is to teach people tons of ways to make more money. it started out as the personal blog of founder, kyle taylor. once it started to take off, he started to bring on new writers, and transition into more of a media company. the most fascinating thing about the penny hoarder is the amount of money they make, and how they make it. last year, they generated close to $40m. and unlike other media companies, they did it without any advertising. instead, they use affilaite marketing by forming partnerships with the right companies. what they do well: using storytelling to write their content to make it more engaging and relatable. they‚Äôll feature or interview interesting people on their site and share how they‚Äôre making money. they also do a great job at not coming off as scammy, which is very easy to fall into in the ‚Äúmake money‚Äù niche. visit site 8. coindesk the leading cryptocurrency blog. coindesk is a website i visit at least 3 times a week. it‚Äôs the most successful cryptocurrency blog in the world, getting over 10 million visitors per month. it was started in 2013 by shakil kha, and then acquired by digital currency group in 2016 for an amount rumored to be around $500,000. today, they‚Äôre the go-to source for all news and updates in the blockchain world. they make money through advertising, publishing paid reports, and selling tickets to their conferences. what they do well: establishing themselves as a leader in a new industry. visit site 9. arstechnica a tech blog that people trust. when i‚Äôm really interested in new tech (like new macbooks being released), i‚Äôm always happy to see ars technica do a piece about it. it was founded a long time ago, in 1998. ten years later, in 2008, it was sold to conde naste for $25m. although they‚Äôve lost readers‚Äô trust a few years back when they attempted to block any visitors using an ad blocker, they‚Äôve rebuilt their reputation by hiring smart writers (most of whom are post-graduates) and writing in-depth pieces of information in the tech world. what they do well: writing really detailed news stories. while most tech blogs merely ‚Äúreport‚Äù the news, ars technica analyzes it. visit site 10. bustle a women‚Äôs publication about everything. the bustle is a site that i study constantly. it was founded by bryan goldberg after he built and sold bleacher report (a sports blog) for $175m. the reason i‚Äôm so interested in bustle is because of bryan‚Äôs infamous announcement before starting the company. he claimed that he would build something that‚Äôs never been done before: a women‚Äôs site that not only talked about fashion but news and pop culture as well. this brought on a fury of haters (which brought in a ton of free links and press coverage üôÇ ), who wrote about the dozens of companies that are already doing just that. another thing that‚Äôs interesting is the reason why bryan decided to create this site. after running bleacher report, he realized that a female audience attracted the most advertisers. so he received funding, hired a bunch of people, and created one of the biggest women‚Äôs blogs in the world. what they do well: covering every aspect of every story that people are interested in. visit site 11. wellness mama a health and wellness blog for mothers. there are a ton of health and wellness blogs out there. but wellness mama stood out from the pack by being one of the first ones in the space to cater their content specifically to mothers. going ultra targeted with your audience targeting is a very effective way to make your blog unique and develop a strong following. katie wells is someone who used this laser targeting strategy perfectly. although her blog isn‚Äôt for everybody, there are a lot of moms out there who agree with wellness mama‚Äôs mission of getting the best information for healthier families. what they do well: going ultra targeted with their audience targeting. visit site 12. thought catalog a deeper, emotional blog written by college students. i don‚Äôt know if chris lavergne, founder of thought catalog, will appreciate the description above but it‚Äôs what i personally think of this blog. thought catalog is like buzzfeed for hipster college students. you‚Äôll mainly see articles about heart break, relationships, and being a stronger person. the coolest thing about thought catalog is how they developed their content. as anyone who blogs will know, it‚Äôs difficult to source good content. thought catalog attracts college students, mostly writing majors, to write on their site for free as a way to build their portfolio. it‚Äôs ‚Äúcool‚Äù to be published on thought catalog. and as a result, they have hundreds of submissions every single day from some of the deepest, brightest minds all over the world. that‚Äôs amazing. what they do well: getting their content for free in an ethical way. coming up with a unique content strategy and executing it perfectly. visit site 13. fatherly a parenting blog for fathers. fatherly is a blog that i researched heavily. it was started in 2015 by mike rothman, one of the co-founders of thrillist. he helped grow thrillist from zero to $100m before leaving to start fatherly. there are a lot of parenting blogs out there, but mike realized that almost all of them are heavily targeted towards moms. furthermore, they often portrayed dads as the goofy one who didn‚Äôt know what they were doing. he aimed to change that with fatherly. and he grew it into one of the fastest growing media companies out there growing to $5m in revenue in just two years. what they do well: doing niche and audience research really, really well. have a listen to this podcast and you‚Äôll realize that he takes niche and audience research to a whole new level. visit site 14. apartment therapy a blog about home design and decor. apartment therapy is one of the leading blogs about home design. it was started in 2004 by maxwell and oliver ryan,

seriously, these guys know how to scale a blog really well. check out this report. visit site 15. kitchn a blog about food. maxwell ryan, mentioned above in apartment therapy‚Äôs description, started

six and seven-figure blogs look like, how they‚Äôre monetizing, what kind of content they publish, etc. but most importantly, i hope it helps spark some niche ideas for your own blogging projects. most of the blog niche ideas i get myself are from analyzing and researching other successful blogs. yes, it‚Äôs true that most of the blogs shared in this list have a huge editorial staff and a ginormous budget to work with, making it impossible for a single person to compete with directly. but that‚Äôs not the point. the point isn‚Äôt to copy them directly. the point is to identify what you can build for yourself based on what others are doing successfully. facebook twitter pinterest you might also like... how to sell your content site for the maximum possible profit the top 5 display

awesome as always chris. btw: what‚Äôs your take about adding the ‚Äúnoopener‚Äù tag on internal links on a page? that is making it to open in a new tab? someone said it affects bounce rate, and also

reply jim hofman october 8, 2018 at 11:02 am a very interesting list with niche sites covering all sorts of different topics. it appears the key to all these sites is great content, which is terrific news for those of us who enjoy writing. one other common thread with this list ‚Äì it appears each site was a passion of the original owner. i personally think this is so important; if you‚Äôre working on a site make sure it‚Äôs in an area of personal interest, strong personal interest. it makes producing content and coming up with content ideas that much easier ‚Ä¶ reply chris lee october 8, 2018 at 4:30 pm excellent point, jim. yeah the personal bloggers in this list really did a good job at transitioning from a personal blog to a media company. they‚Äôve also been the ones that have stuck with it the longest, since it started as passion project. reply deepak october 8, 2018 at 12:33 pm hi chris! wonderful post mate. quick question : as video consumption is growing day by day, do you think starting a new blog is still the way to go or one should rather start youtube channel/facebook video (&fb watch shows) ? reply chris lee october 8, 2018 at 4:31 pm thanks deepak! video is great if you can do it well. for example, much of fatherly‚Äôs early revenue came from video and content on other platforms. however, just because video is growing, doesn‚Äôt mean that blogging and written content is dying. reply paulette quann october 8, 2018 at 1:34 pm thank you so much for this list! and while building a profitable blog remains a bit of an untouchable feat to me, the list is

related to the 12th site, instead of 132, it should be 12. reply chris lee october 8, 2018 at 4:34 pm aha, just fixed it. thanks. reply luke october 8, 2018 at 4:39 pm i think it‚Äôs very important to choose the right niche at the very beginning. beginners make a lot of mistakes that is why their progress is slow or there is none at all and they quit. if i started a blog right now i would know much better what to do with it. reply chris lee october 8, 2018 at 6:04 pm thanks for sharing, luke. beginners do make a ton of mistakes. so my advice usually isn‚Äôt to find the perfect niche in the beginning. just pick something you have a lot of interest in. reply luigi october 8, 2018 at 6:31 pm awesome piece chris. how many posts/articles you think it takes to be a 7 figure blog ? understanding that seo and social is done. reply chris lee october 9, 2018 at 1:17 am thanks luigi. varies wildly. correct answer is‚Ä¶ a lot üôÇ reply bhuboy october 9, 2018 at 1:31 am thanks for

in my mind from a long time and only you can answer this question correctly, as you can see people get their answers in google snippets time to time google snippets gets increases which result in low search engine traffic and low ctr from search engines google gets smarter and smarter day by day will a day come where publishers don‚Äôt get any traffic from search engines because a niche site totally depends on search engine traffic. what your thinking on this, please answer my question because my main source of income totally depends on organic traffic and this scares me a lot. hope you a reply from you thankyou reply chris lee october 11, 2018 at 10:53 pm i think getting less clicks from google is an issue you can‚Äôt ignore, but at the end of the day, they‚Äôre still a search engine
