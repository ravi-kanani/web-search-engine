are they using any of the themes? where on the site is noted that they are using wp? thank you reply wpbeginner support says: nov 8, 2019 at 9:51 am each site is different for what they’re using and if they state they’re using wordpress. for your questions, you may want to take a look at our article here: https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-find-which-wordpress-theme-a-site-is-using/ reply yuvraj khavad says: sep 18, 2019 at 5:44 am hello team, thanks for the good list. just verify beyonce website again. looks like they use python now. thanks again. reply wpbeginner support says: sep 18, 2019 at 9:13 am you’re welcome, we’ll be sure to take a look reply ben says: aug 21, 2019 at 10:45 pm you spelled canada wrong on number 39 reply wpbeginner support says: aug 22, 2019 at 9:52 am thanks for letting us know, we’ll be sure to fix that typo reply arslan says: aug 6, 2019 at 9:25 am mercedes benz don’t use wordpress webiste please don’t misguide reply wpbeginner support says: aug 6, 2019 at 10:49 am while they have customized their site heavily they are currently using wordpress reply wendy says: may 23, 2019 at 12:03 pm thanks for the list reply wpbeginner support says: may 24, 2019 at 9:40 am you’re welcome reply rahmat baghdadi says: jul 30, 2018 at 4:44 am hi there, awesome. i just wonder, it seems all of these sites are being used as a weblog of somesort. can we get a similar list for e-commerce, crm, education and etc. side of wordpress too? i dont expect alibaba or amazon using wordpress to manage their e-commerce, but surely there should be some well known e-commerce wordpress sites, right? reply harneet singh says: aug 26, 2018 at 3:32 pm very valid question. i was evaluating the list before starting my ecomm business. reply dharmendra verma says: apr 11, 2018 at 12:45 am awesome article reply laura says: jul 12, 2017 at 2:42 pm not sure why anyone would expect that any of these large corporations using wp would be using it “straight out of the box” or that they’d be using an easily purchased theme. these guys have development teams that have customized their installs tremendously. and that’s part of what showing the power of wp is about, imho! no, these sites are not the level of your average wpbeginner, or even average wp person at all. but it does go to show that it’s not just little mom and pop companies who use this. reply d4v1d says: may 11, 2017 at 9:55 am nont one of these sites uses wp out of the box – there is considerable custom development to make these sites work the way they do, development costing six figures and more. those sites are not ‘wpbeginner’ grade. reply elika says: dec 19, 2016 at 2:51 am what theme does ‘the nwe yorker ‘ use ?? reply shimul says: dec 15, 2016 at 3:48 am i need a wordpress site like media server or ftp server… if you find any of them just mail me… its really important to me… thanks reply ramesh says: may 11, 2016 at 8:23 am looks like most of these sites are using wp for blogs. not sure if bestbuy is using it for ecommerce platform or just for blogs. reply pintu says: may 9, 2016 at 2:59 pm awesome, i have actually always wanted a comprehensive list like this to show to clients who are a little hesitant when i mention wordpress. great list! reply adeeb says: apr 24, 2016 at 3:08 pm nice list include theverge reply john says: apr 21, 2016 at 5:17 am can anyone name top e-commerce website which uses wordpress? reply surya jaya says: apr 18, 2016 at 3:16 pm can anyone suggest sample websites or themes/plugins to create a website for a small consulting company? reply melissa honeck says: apr 21, 2016 at 4:51 pm hi surya jaya, i just began taking on small businesses refreshing their websites. please email me and we can discuss further! melissa reply kingtnt says: sep 16, 2015 at 11:31 am excellent list, i checked out the sites and it looks like the wall street journal & the philips sites aren’t wordpress. at least any more. reply richard says: sep 9, 2015 at 12:01 pm can anyone suggest sample websites or themes/plugins to create a website for a small consulting company? reply jesse waters says: sep 8, 2015 at 3:41 pm one might with some validity wonder how many of these corporate entities (if any) are using wordpress.com—carrying an assigned domain name—versus their own sites with wordpress[.org] software installed privately reply ryan mcbride says: aug 13, 2015 at 5:30 pm i have a prospective client who told me they don’t think wordpress can handle their ~500 product e-commerce store that requires a great deal of woocommerce customization. they think that mysql will make it slow for such large queries. i cited some of the sites from this article to overcome their objections but it got me thinking– is the ecommerce aspect of a site as large as best buy still handled through wordpress or is it just integrated with a custom shopping cart solution that doesn’t have mysql encumbering it? ryan mcbride website developer reply gjp says: oct 10, 2015 at 6:55 am looks like it’s written in jsp… reply cajun thrityseveen says: jul 8, 2015 at 9:51 am word press is great, but i don’t see any major i.t. or u.s. government entity using it. recently dark reading (i.t. security) posted that many (unpatched) websites have been victimized by persistent hacker groups. what can one set up a test page to get patches automatically, behind the firewall or in the d.m.z. ? reply wpbeginner support says: jul 8, 2015 at 12:06 pm there are thousands of government, non-profit, and it websites using wordpress. using older outdated version of any software on the internet is not recommended. wordpress is used on 24% of all websites so at any given time the number of wordpress websites under attack will always be higher than other cms. reply rambo ruiz says: apr 21, 2015 at 3:03 pm @daniel laixer you can view these websites’ page source and you will see the codes. do a ctrl + f and type in “wp-content” reply daniel laixer says: jan 25, 2015 at 11:21 am but you can modify the page code to remove that :/ reply wpbeginner staff says: dec 18, 2014 at 8:47 pm you are right this is the easiest way. but most business sites usually get it removed. in that case, you will need to look into their homepage’s source code to see if they have generator meta tag, links to wp-content and common wordpress files, and other clues. another easier way is to simply ask the site owner reply daniel laixer says: dec 9, 2014 at 11:16 am ¿but how can you know they’re using wordpress? reply carmello c. antonius says: dec 18, 2014 at 12:02 pm that’s a great question and i definitely remember how to answer it! reply kevin says: dec 4, 2014 at 4:45 pm do you have any examples of (major) technology companies or others using wordpress for their product documentation, like online help topics, including context-sensitive help, for multiple products? that would be good to see as well. reply marc connor says: oct 20, 2014 at 2:42 am excellent list, i checked out the sites and it looks like the wall street journal & the philips sites aren’t wordpress. at least any more. reply brian jackson says: aug 13, 2014 at 4:27 pm awesome, i have actually always wanted a comprehensive list like this to show to clients who are a little hesitant when i mention wordpress. great list! reply don't says: mar 7, 2016 at 6:41 pm don’t mention what platform you’re going to use. reply jerry nwosu says: feb 13, 2019 at 8:52 pm and what if the client ask? reply tell him says: mar 20, 2019 at 2:44 am tell him nevis1 says: aug 13, 2014 at 9:26 am what a great article. next time i have a client who has never heard of wordpress, i can forward this post to them. that ought to open their eyes. reply leave a reply cancel reply thanks for choosing to leave a comment. please keep in mind that all comments are moderated according to our comment policy, and your email address will not be published. please do not use keywords in the name field. let's have a personal and meaningful conversation. don't subscribe all replies to my comments notify me of followup comments via e-mail. you can also subscribe without commenting. over 1,320,000+ readers get fresh content from wpbeginner featured wordpress plugin optinmonster convert website visitors into email subscribers. learn more » i need help with ... starting a blog wordpress performance wordpress security wordpress seo wordpress errors building an online store useful wordpress guides 7 best wordpress backup plugins compared (pros and cons) how to fix the error establishing a database connection in wordpress why you need a cdn for your wordpress blog?
