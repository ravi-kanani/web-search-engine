as managed wordpress hosting. managed wordpress hosting is a concierge service where all technical aspects of running wordpress is managed by the host. this includes security, speed, wordpress updates, daily backups, website uptime, and scalability. the idea behind managed wordpress hosting is to offer a completely hassle-free experience, so you can focus on running your business and doing what you are good at. one of the best parts about managed wordpress hosting is the premium support. your support is provided by real wordpress experts with lots of experience rather than someone who is reading a support manual. customers describe managed wordpress hosting as “a five-star hotel for wordpress” and “like having an army of wordpress experts on your side”. pros and cons of managed wordpress hosting while managed wordpress hosting sounds amazing, it’s not for everybody. take a look at the pros and cons of managed wordpress hosting before you make your decision. advantages of managed wordpress hosting blazing fast – managed wordpress hosting servers are configured specially for wordpress. they are blazing fast even when your website gets a lot of traffic. security – you are practically hacker-proof when you go with a managed wordpress hosting provider. they have a very tight security layer that actively scans for malware and block all hacking attempts. expert support – unlike other web hosts, the staff is highly knowledgeable in wordpress. they advise you against using plugins that impact performance, solve problems faster, and much more. it is like having an army of wordpress experts on your side for assistance. daily backups – they create daily backups and offer restore points if you ever want to revert. automatic updates – you don’t have to worry about updates because they are done automatically. no downtime – no matter how much traffic your site gets, your website will probably never go down. dev tools – although it varies by host, you usually dev tools such as staging area, version control, etc. you are probably thinking that the advantages sounds pretty attractive, are there any downside? disadvantages of managed wordpress hosting price – managed wordpress hosting is significantly more expensive when compared to shared hosting. base plan usually starts around $29/mo. where as shared hosting plan starts at $3.95/mo. but if you factor in the cost of running a large website and the salary of system admin, then this will sound like a pretty good option. limits – because the server architecture is specialized for wordpress, often you are limited to run only wordpress based sites. but that’s what you were looking to do anyways. you also cannot run all wordpress plugins. managed wordpress hosting providers block plugins that slows down your site. so this is not entirely a disadvantage, but it can be an issue for larger companies. less control – since someone else is managing all the technical aspects, you don’t have nearly as much say as to what gets changed. but isn’t that the point? you don’t want the hassle of managing things yourself. now that you have read the pros and cons of managed wordpress hosting, you’re probably wondering if it’s the right solution for you. when do you need managed wordpress hosting? if you are a beginner who is starting a blog, then you do not need managed wordpress hosting. you should start with regular wordpress hosting which is a lot more affordable. we recommend bluehost which is also one of the official wordpress hosting providers. now if you are a small business or have a high-traffic website, then it makes sense for you to get managed wordpress hosting. the decision really boils down to your needs. if you lack the technical skills, then average web hosting can become a hassle as your site grows. with an average hosting (shared, vps, or dedicated), you are responsible for security, updates, speed, uptime, etc. as a business owner, you have two options. you could either hire a system admin to manage your website, or you can use a managed wordpress hosting provider. if you want something that is hassle-free, blazing fast, and offer mind-blowing support, then you have your answer. basically, if your website is your business, and you can’t afford it to go down, then pay the extra bucks for the exceptional service that you will get with managed wordpress hosting. in the end, you have to decide whether you can justify the cost for the value. if low cost is your biggest priority, then go with a non-managed wordpress hosting provider. now that you have read all about managed wordpress hosting, it is time for you to make a decision. we run several sites that get millions of pageviews per month. we have tested and worked with all top web hosting

wpbeginner users trust us is because our reviews are result of real-time tests, accurate data, and actual usage. instead of relying on information available on hosting company’s website, we actually sign up for managed wordpress hosting providers to properly test their services. we use professional benchmarking tools and run thorough tests to measure performance and reliability of each provider. to make sure our tests are accurate across all managed wordpress hosting companies, we sign up with each hosting company and create a sample website. next, we install a default theme and fill the site with dummy data including images and media. this way our test site resembles like an average wordpress website. here is the breakdown of our step by step testing process. first, we measure the website speed across multiple managed wordpress hosting companies. we use pingdom for this test, which is an industry leading website speed testing service. next, we test how a managed wordpress hosting company would perform during peak traffic. for this we use load impact service to send virtual users (vu) to each website and see how the hosting server would handle increased requests from multiple connections at once. last but not least, we use bitcatcha service to test server response times across numerous geographical locations including united states, london, singapore, sao paulo, india, sydney, and japan. this helps us decide which managed wordpress hosting is best for which geographical location. now that you know our exact testing process, let’s compare the performance of the top managed wordpress hosting companies. 1. wp engine wp engine is one of the most popular managed wordpress hosting providers. their hosting plans include powerful in-house performance optimization, managed updates, 1-click staging environment, and more. here are the results from our wp engine performance tests: first we tested our sample wp engine website for speed. as you can in the screenshot, our test site loaded in less than a second. that’s faster than 96% of all tested sites. considering that we didn’t need to install any performance optimization this result is quite impressive. but how does wp engine performs under peak traffic? to test performance under traffic, we ran the load impact test on wp engine server. during this test, we gradually built up to 100 unique visitors to see how the server would handle increased requests from multiple connections at once. the green line in this graph represents page load time and the blue line represents number of users on the site. as you can see that wp engine server performance remained steady throughout the test as the numbers of users increased. next, we tested the wp engine server for more accurate response time. for this test we used bitcatcha to test server response time more accurately from multiple geographical locations. as you can see in the results, wp engine server response time remained under less than half a second on all geographic locations. it was particularly great in the united states. in our detailed wp engine review, we also evaluated their customer support, features, and pricing. after our analysis, we find wp engine to be the best managed wordpress hosting provider for any kind of website. pros: highly optimized for wordpress performance with fully stable managed hosting pros: 1-click staging environment, free ssl, and integrated support to add cdn service as an addon pros: powerful yet easy to use custom hosting control panel with excellent customer support. cons: prices are

amazing. but how would our siteground test site perform under peak traffic? to test this, we ran the load impact test on siteground servers. during this test, we gradually increased to 100 unique visitors to see how the server would handle increased requests from multiple connections at once. in this screenshot, the blue line represents the number of active virtual users on the site. the green line is the server load time. siteground performed almost consistently except for a spike at 50 users on the site. it quickly recovered and page load time remained steadily low even with more users. next, we ran a more detailed and accurate response time test. for this, we used bitcatcha to test accurate server response time from different geographical locations. our siteground test site performed exceptionally well in the united states and all other locations except japan. if your target audience is mainly in asia, then you can ask siteground to move you to their asia-pacific servers to remedy this. in our detailed siteground review, we also evaluated their customer support, features, and pricing. after our analysis, we find siteground to be an excellent choice for managed wordpress hosting. their servers are incredibly fast and support is available 24/7 by knowledgeable and friendly staff. pros: awesome wordpress support, great uptime, blazing fast speed, and free ssl.

once to see how the server handles increased requests from multiple connections at the same time. here is the result screenshot: in this chart, the blue line indicates number of active virtual users on the website, and the green line shows server load time. the server load remained stable through out the test even at peak traffic. next, we used bitcatcha for more accurate server response time test from different geographic regions. response times for our bluehost test site were exceptionally great in the united states loading under a fraction of a second. response time in other locations

each too so this is not one site only. the rest will let you down too imo compared to wpe. the saving of a few dollars a month is not worth it. plus wpe have uk servers as well as us, dedicated ips, security is far better. anyone using godaddy do a little research too, not a great track record. reply wpbeginner support says: aug 5, 2019 at 11:14 am thanks for sharing your recommendation for wp

their branding but normally they are different. reply martha doolittle says: may 9, 2019 at 3:42 pm curious how far down the list is godaddy? they handle the hosting for the email server we use and changing hosts seems complicated. they give us very good service, but they quoted me $150 to make the change from cpanel to managed word press, so we can create a test site to update all plugins and incorporate gutenberg. reply wpbeginner support says: may 10, 2019 at 11:09 am unless i hear otherwise, for the moment they are not one of our recommended managed hosts. reply adit says: may 9, 2019
