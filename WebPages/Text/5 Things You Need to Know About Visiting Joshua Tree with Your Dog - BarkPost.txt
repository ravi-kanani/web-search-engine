there are a bunch in the palm desert area! la quinta cove: the surrounding santa rosa and san jacinto mountains make this less than 2-mile walk so memorable. there wasn’t much snow on the top of the mountains this winter but the scenery was still beautiful. palm desert cross: this 3.5-mile hike starts from cahuilla hills park. take gabby hayes trail then turn left on to hopalong cassidy trail. stay on it until you get to the cross. it’s out and back. there is a restroom at the trailhead. do you plan to visit other national parks this year with your dog?
