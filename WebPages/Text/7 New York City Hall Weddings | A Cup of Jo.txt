it’s very “when harry met sally” :) january 6, 2020 5:52pm / reply emma says... yesssss city hall weddings!! i got married in may at the city hall in san francisco and it was the best. there is such great energy there and it can be exactly what you want it to be, no stressing about things that don’t actually matter to you. i had the dress of my dreams and a great photographer and a simple bouquet my dad made for me and didn’t have to make seating charts or buy invitations. afterwards we all went out for a drink at the ferry building, stopped by a playground so my nieces could run around a bit before we all stuffed ourselves with chinese food for dinner!

december 20, 2019 4:35am / kc says... just read through the profiles and thought how funny it is that total strangers sharing a big, personal celebratory moment can be so uplifting to me, on my phone, in bed 1,000 miles away. i’m actually smiling ear to ear! thanks for the post, and my heartfelt congratulations to all the lovely couples! december 18, 2019 10:15pm / reply m says... i love this post. thank you for asking the questions i’d wish were socially acceptable to ask if i were in a place like that, and publishing the answers for all of us to read! more, please! it made me happy! december 18, 2019 4:22pm / reply jane says... what a diverse group! i am in love with todd and rachel, may their happiness with each other last forever! likewise all! december 18, 2019 4:01pm / reply elisabeth says... this is awesome! i’m going there on monday to get married :) december 19, 2019 8:28am / milly says... lovely idea, and beautiful couples. we’re from the uk and got married at city hall in 2002 – we “borrowed” our witness from the couple behind – she had the lovely name of katiusca ferreira and i regret that i have never tracked her down to say thanks. we’re v happily married, with two kids, and would observe three things (1) the excitement of ny’ers at meeting/ seeing tourists married in their city was very moving, some 6 months after 9/11 (2) us border control do not like people with wedding dresses arriving at jfk, though better when you point out the groom has a uk passport (3) sending postcards home that say “ps we got married this morning” is a sure fire way to annoy your family and friends december 18, 2019 1:55pm / reply katherine says... love love love love this december 18, 2019 12:48pm / reply elisabeth says... this is awesome! i’m going there on monday to get married :) december 19, 2019 8:30am / natasa says... once i saw a new york city hall wedding post here on cup of jo and said to myself, i need to find a guy who will want to marry me here. a few years after, i found the man who became my husband in this very place. we’re from vienna, austria and looking into our wedding day photo book is one of my favorite things to do. december 18, 2019 11:53am / reply michelle says... this is awesome but can you do some outfit posts for christina and shady? i love their style! december 18, 2019 11:35am / reply joanna r says... i second that request! december 18, 2019 10:58pm / carter says... this was great!! would love to see this again. december 18, 2019 11:31am / reply liz says... can’t help but smile at this!! december 18, 2019 11:19am / reply carolyn says... my heart is so full of joy! this was such a beautiful post! i do also hope you will do it again. especially knowing how dreary the weather was yesterday i love imagining these couples having beautiful, happy, loved-filled days together. december 18, 2019 11:03am / reply heather says... “yes, also the butt.” ha! this feels like a fun throwback/full circle to joanna’s early career at cosmopolitan, “where my editorial responsibilities included stopping good-looking men on the street and asking them funny questions.” as a shy introvert, i can’t imagine going up to strangers and asking them questions, but i love that you used your extrovert/professional superpowers to do it on our behalf! december 18, 2019 9:58am / reply joanna goddard says... haha yes! it was like the old days! :) december 18, 2019 11:16am / jrg says... every single couple’s outfits are amazing! december 18, 2019 9:51am / reply amanda says... as an engaged person who a) doesn’t really stan wedding content, b) does not have any type of money or family money for a wedding, and c) looooves love, i adore this post. december 18, 2019 8:55am / reply joanna goddard says... <3 december 18, 2019 11:16am / stephanie says... i love this. it’s something i’ve always loved the idea of doing, the fact that there is zero pressure of guest lists, menus and seating arrangements. i also love the fact that it can just be the two of you (it would be three including our daughter), all i’d want is a nice beautiful dress and a photographer to take the pictures for us, and proceed to have a wonderful honeymoon somewhere tropical. december 18, 2019 8:12am / reply luísa says... please!!!!!! december 18, 2019 7:57am / reply em says... awh i love this post! i think this should definitely be a repeat :) december 18, 2019 6:17am / reply jen says... yay! my husband and i got married in nyc city hall and had the best time! we were living in saudi arabia at the time and came to the city for one day before we left again for our honeymoon. i love seeing pictures of other people’s weddings there because it makes me feel like i’m a part of a big, diverse community of love! december 18, 2019 4:49am / reply agnes says... yes to a regular post of these! they look so perfect! i suppose it’s love radiating from each couple… those photos and interviews are uplifting. that last dress, looooove it!! december 18, 2019 4:49am / reply joanna goddard says... would love to do this again when it’s sunny so we can photograph them outside! december 18, 2019 11:16am / g says... so sweet. we had a new york city hall wedding before our traditional ceremony because #greencard. it was so fun people watching and seeing what the other couples were wearing and doing. it might be the happiest place in manhattan :) december 18, 2019 12:40am / reply fifi says... ouu i see the nigerians!!!!

congratulations to all of these couples! i wish them all the best! december 17, 2019 10:31pm / reply amber j says... this was so lovely to read! i giggled at them all. thank you! december 17, 2019 10:13pm / reply amy says... heartwarming and charming and just what i needed this chilly tuesday! december 17, 2019 9:53pm / reply kirsten s suer says... i love that the last couple love that the other is pleasant. being married for nearly 20 years, i think such a characteristic – exuding a sense of happiness, being considerate, likable – is helpful. with the addition of children, jobs, and other assorted responsibilities, it can be difficult to remember at times, but being nice to one another makes a relationship sustainable. december 17, 2019 9:44pm / reply courtney says... i love this post! i also love how different they all are!! super refreshing. december 17, 2019 9:35pm / reply mila says... loved reading these! please make it a regular feature on the blog! december 17, 2019 9:27pm / reply sg says... yes- i agree!! and a little more info about each of them please!! congrats to all the couples. this definitely put a smile on my face in such a bitter news world. december 18, 2019 6:08am / lauren says... i went to high school with megan from the first photo! what a cool surprise to see her on here! she (and her husband) look so lovely and happy. 😊 december 17, 2019 9:03pm / reply joanna goddard says... what a small world! december 18, 2019 11:17am / laura says... joining the chorus of people who would love to see this as a regular feature! december 17, 2019 8:43pm / reply alex says... we got married there! it’s amazing. i recommend it to anyone i know who gets engaged. congrats to the happy couples! december 17, 2019 7:53pm / reply gj says... wow, i really adored this. what a great idea for a post! december 17, 2019 6:36pm / reply louisa says... visit san francisco city hall!! i got married there on a tuesday by judge mary. :) the best. december 17, 2019 5:43pm / reply jules says... i eloped on a tuesday, too! ❤ december 17, 2019 6:07pm / daniela says... was she a little old lady? i think she’s the one who married us in september, loved her! december 17, 2019 7:57pm / louisa says... daniela – yes! december 17, 2019 11:04pm / jane says... would be interesting to hear marriage stories from the city hall judges – surely there must be some interesting ones! december 18, 2019 4:06pm / caitlyn says... yay! we got married at nyc city hall and our anniversary is coming up on feb. 29th (our first “real” anniversary since we married on leap day). i love this! the atmosphere there really was amazing and contagious. we didn’t realize we needed a witness and another couple’s parents stepped in for us! it was such a wonderful communal moment. love! december 17, 2019 5:36pm / reply eleanor says... i could read a million of these!! it’s like humans of new york but with the happiest twist! december 17, 2019 5:17pm / reply mercy says... i completely agree! i want more! haha december 17, 2019 9:06pm / neela says... perfect counterpoint to the previous article, for those of us who maybe can’t handle the sad. thanks for being such an amazing and and thoughtful team ❤ december 17, 2019 4:52pm / reply joanna goddard says... xoxo december 18, 2019 11:18am / nade says... omg! the daughter of sade and segun is the cutest thing ever! love her outfit, too. as well as her parents’ december 17, 2019 4:46pm / reply danna says... i came here to say just that. she’s adorable and i love her shiny gold shoes! december 17, 2019 5:20pm / jeannie says... i love all of these! congratulations and best wishes to you all! fun to see all the beautiful dresses and happy faces! december 17, 2019 4:39pm / reply kim says... yes to the suggestion of this being a monthly feature! december 17, 2019 4:27pm / reply maria says... weekly!!!! :) december 17, 2019 11:58pm / lauren says... my husband and i got married at city hall! i was very nervous and misheard the justice of the peace when she greeted us, and it sounded like she said, “lauren and joe, you guys are the best.” “that’s really nice of her to say,” i thought, “but i sure hope none of the other couples overhear her and feel bad!” december 17, 2019 4:25pm / reply alice noriega says... loved this story. was wanting to know even more about the couples…but you gave us just enough. bravo! 🌷 december 17, 2019 4:25pm / reply leah says... omg love this!! you can feel the happiness through the screen and that’s just what i needed while i sit here at my desk :) please do this again sometime! december 17, 2019 4:20pm / reply kate says... congratulations to the happy couples! my husband and i got married at city hall almost exactly two years ago (in december 2017) and the whole city felt magical (the snow! the lights! the holiday festivities!) our family came to celebrate with us, and ended up chatting with the young couple behind us in line, who’d come from overseas—just the two of them—to tie the knot. my mom (a hobby photographer) took pictures for them, and my little brother (tidied up in a suit!) acted as their witness. more than anything, i love the sense of community a city hall wedding can foster. december 17, 2019 4:10pm / reply nikki says... guys! i got married at the magistrate office and it was the best. we have a big ceremony planned for april but due to military orders i needed to get on we did the legal stuff a month ago. highlights: – only my best friend knew it was happening that morning. i needed help picking out an outfit so she came over. she brought a bouquet. a special surprise. – our witnesses were strangers, we witnessed theirs and vice versa. we were all married in front of a cheesy beach mural. – it was super romantic, just us. i didn’t think it would be so special, but those two minutes were perfect. it was fun that we felt no pressure before or after- just us in that moment. – afterwards, we were going to a nice restaurant but one doesn’t exist in our military town so we ate cheese and crackers and drank really nice champagne. that night we ordered pizza. i’m excited to marry him again in april in front of our family and friends. we’ve told a few select few people but overall it’s just a fun romantic secret. i call him my husband under the covers. i highly recommend getting married before you get married. december 17, 2019 4:06pm / reply joanna goddard says... nikki, that’s so romantic! december 18, 2019 11:18am / nk says... love this! my husband and i went to city hall in nyc to get our marriage license before our wedding and it was one of the most fun experiences ever. everyone is in an amazing mood, people are all dressed up and either with their families or just with each other. i could have stayed there all day, it was so amazing! it’s probably a pretty fun job to work there too. december 17, 2019 4:06pm / reply pat in chicago says... really loved this post. what is better than love! december 17, 2019 3:51pm / reply kate says... i love this… but, logistical question. are the people posing in front of a big picture of city hall? is this located in city hall itself? december 17, 2019 3:48pm / reply joanna goddard says... oh yes! it’s a big photo backdrop in the main lobby. it’s a fun tradition to take a photo there! :) here are my friends’ photos, so you can see more of the space: https://cupofjo.com/2011/08/new-york-city-hall-wedding/ december 17, 2019 3:49pm / ks says... my heart needed this joy. why do i love weddings like this so much? xx december 17, 2019 3:42pm / reply lisa says... ooooooh please make this a regular feature!
