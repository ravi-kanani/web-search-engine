take 3 simple steps to focus your content how i learned to love (ruthless) editing struggling to finish your blog post? try this quick editing tip you could also think of your point as the moral of your story. ultimately, if a story doesn’t serve, it can sound like rambling, a diary entry, or even gossip. 4. set boundaries speaking of gossip, i also call this one: “you’re a writer, not the town gossip.” authenticity doesn’t include spilling every shocking secret you know. your story can be true without divulging parts that are inappropriate. as you develop your presentation, some boundaries will arise organically and other times you’ll have to ask yourself: do i need to say that? do i want to be known for saying that? does this accurately reflect who i am? writers need to “check themselves.” it’s an integral part of the profession. 5. choose specific language i love applying techniques from other creative fields to content marketing. during an interview in 1976 about his songwriting process, leonard cohen said: “i’ve always felt that the more personal you get, the more universal the application, rather than the other way around. “if you begin to address yourself to the masses like that, then i suppose you could have a hit, but to me the more accurate you get about your situation, then the more accessible it is to other people.” here’s an example from a saturday night live sketch, which appeals to women who wear leggings when relaxing rather than exercising. the clip mentions the reality show vanderpump rules. it’s more powerful to add that specific name instead of a vague phrase like “trashy tv.” i’ve never seen vanderpump rules, but the sentiment in that line immediately evokes thoughts of my guilty pleasure while relaxing in leggings: falling down rabbit holes on youtube. 6. avoid excessive praise or bad-mouthing it’s typically a sign that you’re deviating from your point if you elaborate on how much you love or hate someone or something. even though other people can relate to the emotions of love and hate, musings related to your individual circumstances are often not useful. expressions of gratitude or frustration from your experiences can be made without tangents that don’t keep your reader’s best interest in mind. 7. empower a transformation this is another tip about avoiding extremes, such as putting a spotlight on yourself as a victim or a hero. descriptions of failure or success have to benefit the audience. position those details in ways that empower the transformation the reader wants to have, rather than attacking or bolstering your own character. you know “self-indulgent” when you see it two thoughts we commonly have when we encounter self-indulgent content are: “where is this going?” “this is already really repetitive.” but we all have to practice recognizing those qualities in our own work too, before we publish. copyblogger’s content writing masterclass starting monday, march 23, 2020, stefanie flaxman will be hosting a live learning experience called the copyblogger content writing masterclass. this is a live, interactive, 5-day workshop that is built for all types of content creators who want to build an audience of interested prospects. register for the masterclass tweet share share pin filed under: content marketing, editing, writing stefanie flaxman stefanie flaxman is copyblogger’s editor-in-chief. she teaches better writing, disciplined creativity, and non-sleazy marketing. get more from stefanie on youtube. reader interactions primary sidebar notice: javascript is required for this content. you might also like: do you make these 7 mistakes when you write? the wise content marketer’s guide to sensible seo 3 important seo tips you can start using today the 5 things every (great) marketing story needs quit annoying your audience!

these 7 tips are worthy of learning in order to increase the effectiveness of your content. thanks for sharing! stefanie flaxman says april 18, 2018 at 7:59 pm i’m a big supporter of writers developing self-editing skills. 🙂 it’s really a matter of — to use your phrase — getting good at recognizing the parts where you’ll “lose your reader.” thanks for sharing, jane! ryan biddulph says april 17, 2018 at 4:59 am being genuine helps you find that balance stefanie. per being human, we overthink stuff. but when writing from the heart you are being you, sharing your personal journey, having fun and connecting with exactly the folks who want to hear your personal stories. even if said stories stray into the realm of self-indulgent behavior. my readers care not for nature shots, even though i share ’em regularly. nope; selfies are preferred. as are my silly stories, and links to blogging. definitely off the cuff in many regards yet i have fun writing these tales and my readers have spoken. this works nicely with your advice. listen, and feel their nudges. being genuine is key though. like if you are being your authentic self through your writing, readers who crave that message – even if self-focused – find you and gobble it up, wanting more. the vicariously living through me thing in play and i am a change up in both travel and blogging tips niches. cool share stefanie. i will begin reading cb regularly again; absolute gem i have missed while busy with other fun stuff. i will be back 😉 ryan stefanie flaxman says april 18, 2018 at 8:01 pm glad to hear you’ve been doing other fun stuff, ryan — but good to see you back! 🙂 katherine says april 18, 2018 at 8:50 am these points hit a salient point with me right now. a friend asked me to help him write a memoir, but i struggled to say why i was leery of the project. you captured those concerns here though; self-indulgence, lack of direction, knowing your audience;yup, those are all flags. and as much as i might be guilty of some of these traits in my own writing on occasion, when it comes to ghost writing a book for someone else, i don’t want to get lost in the process. thanks for sharing stefanie stefanie flaxman says april 18, 2018 at 8:09 pm terrific example, katherine! lack of direction is a major obstacle for editors and ghostwriters. it’s hard to do your best work on a project when there is no clear point. good luck breaking the news to your friend … my suggestion is letting him know that where he’s at right now is not the right fit for how you work. here are some more thoughts about the benefits of saying “no,” if you’re interested: https://copyblogger.com/no/ kathie york says april 20, 2018 at 12:21 pm yeah, this hit home. i am a proofer. i find allllllllll kinds (!) of problems with client files… but every once in a while one of my editors or proofers taps my humble button. i doubled down, timewise, to get an inspiration-came-out-of-the-blue article written quickly. i was so proud of it, but one of my editors moved stuff around and slashed four sentences. in a row! she said, “it all works fine, but if you do this, it will flow fine.” ouch. yep. we have to be careful not to press too much and leave the audience behind. appreciate this (ouch!) one :-> stefanie flaxman says april 20, 2018 at 5:14 pm sorry about the “ouch,” kathie! but i appreciate you sharing the feedback you got — it’s a great illustration of the writing process. 🙂 evan says april 21, 2018 at 1:09 pm absolutely agree with this, especially point number 2! people overlook the power of storytelling outside of the obvious applications. emails, internal communications, slideshows, simple landing pages, whatever… they can all benefit from inserting a bit of that ‘journey’ (whether it ends up being first person or not.) great post! stefanie flaxman says april 24, 2018 at 2:19 pm thanks, evan! yep, there are so many opportunities for strategic storytelling in business content. 🙂 shea castle says april 26, 2018 at 10:41 am my posts typically revolve around expressing a personal opinion, but i’m often loathe to dive into too much personal information for fear of that “self-indulgent” moniker. why should people care about me and my opinions more than anyone else’s? my wife (who is not a writer but is much smarter than me) is constantly pushing me to write more personally. this article is a great supporting argument that you can write personally without making everything about yourself. can’t wait to tell her that — as usual — she’s right. stefanie flaxman says april 27, 2018 at 4:56 pm very cool, shea!
