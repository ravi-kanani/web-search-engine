you want to be comfortable in a happy and healthy body because a healthy body will get a lot more work done than a sluggish one. this matters even more for bloggers, freelancers, and other entrepreneurs who depend on their minds to be sharp to get their work done. if you use these 9 tips for getting a night of better sleep, you will definitely have the motivation to work! you will also improve your work-life balance! 1: keep a consistent sleep schedule when you work for yourself, it‚Äôs easy to ignore any kind of routine, but this one matters. by sleeping at the same times every day, you train your internal clock. this can lead to falling asleep faster and waking up easier, which means less wasted time staring at the clock, waiting to fall asleep. 2: exercise daily exercise will help your body feel ready for rest at night. not only will it help you fall asleep faster, but it will keep you asleep for the night. even light exercise can produce a significant improvement. 3: make your bed a relaxing place to be invest in a comfortable mattress. if your mattress has reached ten years old, it is definitely time for a new one. also, look into quality egyptian cotton sheets and quality pillows. 4: don‚Äôt look at your phone it‚Äôs a routine that many of us have gotten into, and it‚Äôs a bad idea. the blue light from your phone will not help you get to sleep. you could turn on the feature that reduces the blue light, but you should avoid looking at your phone before you go to bed. if you‚Äôre really having a hard time with this, put your phone in another room at night. keeping this distraction out of your room is a great way to get better sleep. you might need to buy an alarm clock if you place your phone far away. however, what i do is use the do not disturb feature on my phone. this feature turns off all sounds on my phone (including notifications as well as stopping it from ringing) but it allows the alarm function to still work. so, when i need to wake up, i can still hear the alarm! it always works, too, because i chose a really annoying alarm and i set it to the maximum volume! 5: avoid heavy meals for the three hours before bedtime, don‚Äôt eat. indigestion will keep you awake late into the night. certain food will also cause you to have strange dreams or nightmares, if you eat before you go to bed. i have experienced this firsthand! 6: no caffeine for the truly coffee-addicted person, this can be rough. switch out your evening cup of coffee for a relaxing sleepy-time tea. 7: create a bedtime routine winding down before bed is a good way to let your body know that yes, it‚Äôs time to sleep. reading a book has always been a good plan for this time of night. did you know that reading a book can be like going on a vacation? journaling can help with, too, especially if you take 10 minutes to write down what you are most grateful for and what went well in your day. 8: turn on the air conditioner or open a window your body naturally cools down before bed, so lowering the temperature in your bedroom is a good way to signal to your body it‚Äôs time for sleep. studies have found that rooms between 60 and 67 degrees can naturally increase melatonin production, which improves sleep quality. 9: talk to your doctor if you‚Äôve tried some of these natural suggestions and still can‚Äôt sleep, it‚Äôs time to talk to your doctor. they may suggest taking melatonin, an over-the-counter supplement, or they may prescribe something stronger. having difficulty sleeping and staying asleep can also be indicative of sleep apnea. your doctor can arrange for you to attend a sleep study, where this can be diagnosed. conclusion getting a night of better sleep is imperative to a healthy body and proper mental functioning. use the tips provided here to improve your sleeping and productivity patterns!
