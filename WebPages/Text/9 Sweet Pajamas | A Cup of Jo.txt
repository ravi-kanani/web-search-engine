(just not allowed to post any picture of it on instagram- haha) for the past few years i’ve given my kids a christmas eve box with the above mentioned pjs, a christmas movie, some hot chocolate and then something different each year like a new pillow or a robe. my kids go nuts for it. they all say that the christmas eve box is the best part of christmas and it’s sweet because it’s not anything extravagant or fancy. it’s just the ritual of it that they seem to love. november 13, 2018 12:01pm / reply monica says... penguins all around!!! november 13, 2018 11:24am / reply jordana @whitecabana says... great fun for the kids! could you do a similar post for adults, too? november 13, 2018 11:06am / reply joanna goddard says... that would be fun! my favorite pajamas, which i wear almost every single night, are these: https://amzn.to/2t8md1j (they’re great for travel, too, since they don’t wrinkle!) would love to hear others xoxo november 13, 2018 12:39pm / kelly says... i second the eberjey ones. i have three pairs now, and love their nightgowns too. this time of year, they’re almost always on sale, so shop around a bit! november 14, 2018 12:32pm / jordana @whitecabana says... oh, yes, i know you’ve written about eberjey on many occasions. they seem so soft! i tend to buy my pjs from the gap…but sometimes i just don’t like their patterns. november 14, 2018 6:34pm / sherrelle says... i started this when my first kid was born – 23 years ago – and we still continue; we all get pjs for christmas eve. most of the time they are not matching but sometimes my daughter and i will match and my husband and son will match (usually because the boys get their from gap or bloomingdales/ralph lauren and the girls wear pj savage, which has adult and kid sizes). each person gets to pick out their own pjs – but they can’t wear them until christmas eve. november 13, 2018 10:47am / reply nina says... christmas eve my son gets a pair of pajamas and a new movie. he is big into one piece pjs (without feet) and got a unicorn last year. now he has a skeleton and i’ve seen a grinch one i might get him. we don’t really care what it is, as long as its soft…so glad they are making adult sized now as he’s almost as tall as me at 11. he also gets only five presents the day of christmas: something to wear, something to read, someone he wants, and something he needs. and i fill his stocking but i start purchasing for that months in advance. i let him pick his own stocking when he was 4 and he got the biggest he could find. it finally started falling apart last year so we must find a new one. and we usually go to a movie. and he gets an advent calendar. usually just a chocolate one but amazin has lego and playmobile and he has gotten those in the past, too. got one from aldi this year. november 13, 2018 10:30am / reply laura c. says... oh the trees, definitely the trees! i like all these traditions about matching pjs. your christmas sound lovely. november 13, 2018 10:18am / reply ruth says... all of us (me, hubby, and our daughter) get one set of matching hanna andersson jammies every year. my husband, who never wore pajamas, has bought a whole bunch of sets for himself too. they are the best! november 13, 2018 9:06am / reply kelly says... yes, pjs on christmas eve! it’s been a family tradition since i can remember (i’m 28, my sister 26). my mom has been told this must continue for eternity. :) november 13, 2018 8:23am / reply lynn-holly says... we wear matching pjs every year for christmas! my parents thought we’d be over it when we got older, but now, even as adults, my two sisters and i still love it. our husbands and my sisters’ children have just been added to the tradition. we look like a cheesy department store add… but it’s such a fun tradition. last year we wore hanna andersson pjs and they were so soft. a little more pricey than the old navy and target pajamas we’ve worn in the past, but so worth it. november 13, 2018 7:39am / reply adri says... this is really cute with the added husbands! :) i don’t even know where i’d buy pjs both my mom and dad would be willing to wear, hha! (but will try this year, i think:) november 13, 2018 12:07pm / vicki says... we have a christmas tradition i started with my kids that santas elves drop off pajamas on christmas eve. its a fun challenge as the elves leave them on the porch and ring the doorbell when the pajamas are dropped off so an adult has to slip out and back in! the kids get cozy new pjs (sometimes matching) and adults get to create a bit of magic. november 13, 2018 5:48am / reply peppermint dolly says... christmas eve jammies have been a ritual in my family for what feels like forever – it’s one i love and won’t be letting go of any time soon! rebecca november 13, 2018 3:34am / reply vivi says... i love these! being pregnant and just a tad emotional i find this so cute i could almost cry! november 13, 2018 3:16am / reply lauren says... this is timely! i’m looking for some christmas jammies for the family. the problem is: we live in a tropical climate. has anyone in the southern hemisphere found “summer christmas jammies”? thanks in advance. :) also- for the record- cup of jo is the best blog on the internets and i start each day with joanna and team. :) november 13, 2018 2:33am / reply emily says... old navy has really stepped up their family pj game for christmas this year. i just scooped up an adorable buffalo plaid onesie for my toddler and matching pants for my husband and i. november 12, 2018 11:15pm / reply christy says... yes they have! i need a budget friendly option these days with kids! november 13, 2018 12:27pm / joanna goddard says... yes, old navy has great options! gap, too. november 13, 2018 12:37pm / brittany says... love the kids pjs! would love to see a post on some cozy but cute adult options too – my husband is tired of seeing me in an extra large t shirt and basketball shorts 😂 november 12, 2018 10:29pm / reply ellen says... hannahandersson!! november 13, 2018 1:34am / vicki says... yes to adult pj post! its cold and i want something cozy november 13, 2018 5:41am / stephanie bennett says... i invested in two jcrew cotton sets – shorts for summer, long sleeves for winter – recently and love them, but yes to more cute adult pjs/lounge wear! november 13, 2018 9:46am / kristin says... i think we need an adult pj roundup as i would 100% wear all of these sets myself! november 12, 2018 9:56pm / reply sarah says... holding my breath for your 2018 gift guide! my family is starting to ask for lists and i want to say, how can i pick without jo’s guidance?! november 12, 2018 9:46pm / reply elizabeth says... aw, what a great idea! also, i would love a lucy and cady update one of these days; i wonder how they’re doing sometimes. (i hope very well!) november 12, 2018 8:19pm / reply joanna goddard says... thanks for your sweet note. they are doing very well :) november 12, 2018 9:15pm / katherine says... love me some cuddly pjs! i have a two week old daughter, and something i’ve been looking forward to the most about her being here for the holidays is family pajamas sets, meaning a matching pair for mom and dad as well as baby. does anyone have any recommendations of where to buy matching baby/kid/adult pj sets? love the ones listed here, but i need grown up sizes, too! thanks in advance! november 12, 2018 7:54pm / reply erin maree fischer says... peter alexander does, they are an australian pj store but you can buy them online :) https://www.peteralexander.com.au november 12, 2018 9:31pm / kathleen says... i saw burt’s bees advertising some cute parent baby sets online november 12, 2018 9:35pm / lori says... https://www.hannaandersson.com there is a “family matching pajamas” section! november 12, 2018 9:38pm / catherine mck says... hanna anderson has awesome adult pjs. (i think they made the yellow stripes and penguins above) they’re pricey but last forever and the amount of joy my boys get out of us all wearing our chosen stripe colors is well worth it! november 12, 2018 9:39pm / kerry says... hanna andersson does online. november 12, 2018 10:15pm / annie says... target usually has them too! november 13, 2018 1:56am / kaitlin says... old navy does online too!! november 13, 2018 10:01am / sheila says... i’m 37 and still insist on getting christmas pjs every year! my mom tried to stop it a few years ago and i let her know in no uncertain terms that that would be unacceptable. it’s the only time i get new pjs, how can she stop that?! my nephews are now included on the tradition…we don’t get matching ones but it’s still fun to open them on christmas eve. november 12, 2018 7:29pm / reply tj says... ‘lost their collective grandparent mind’ 🤣 love this november 12, 2018 6:43pm / reply anjali bidani says... i love this as well – if you have someone who can receive packages in london, marks and spencer has awesome ones on their uk site (they had great ones on the us site last year, but no more, sadly.) november 12, 2018 6:39pm / reply megan says... i love this tradition so much. i’m 30 and my sister is 26 and our mom still gets us matching pjs every year! this will be our first christmas apart as we spent it with our respective significant others, but it will be nice knowing we’re both opening the same thing on christmas eve and waking up in it on christmas morning. november 12, 2018 6:23pm / reply joanna goddard says... that is really really sweet :) november 12, 2018 6:32pm / t says... yes! i am 40 and my sister is 37 and we still get matching pjs too. my mom buys our spouses pjs as well and our kids and we open them christmas eve and put them on. i love it. november 12, 2018 7:23pm / c says... in australia it’s too hot at christmas time so we get easter pyjamas. november 13, 2018 6:55am / meltown says... my sisters and i are 35, 33, and 31 and my mom buys us matching pj’s too! even when we aren’t together for the holidays she still sends them to us. now i do it for my kids and nephews too! november 13, 2018 10:05am / cancel reply comment name email website notify me of follow-up comments by email. about / contact joanna goddard brighten up your inbox let’s hang out contact me motherhood most popular trying out slow parenting best of: parenting around the world how did you know you were ready to have a baby? how to navigate a special needs encounter ‘ten things i always tell pregnant women’ 21 completely subjective rules for raising teenage boys raising race-conscious children one thing that has surprised me about parenting motherhood mondays: ‘i had a stillborn baby.’ 8 confessions of a new dad load more motherhood surprising parenting advice motherhood talking to kids motherhood work/life balance disclosure in order to grow our small business, cup of jo earns revenue in a few different ways. we publish several sponsored posts each month, which are always labeled at the top. we also sometimes earn an affiliate commission on the sales of products we link to. we feature only items we genuinely love and want to share, and this is an arrangement between the retailer and cup of jo (readers never pay more for products). these are the ways we support cup of jo, and allow us to run the site and engage with this community we truly love. thank you for reading! you might also like style my beauty uniform: samin nosrat food our new favorite dish for dinner parties design hanging kids’ artwork travel how to find that great vacation restaurant, and other burning questions relationships an encyclopedia of exes motherhood 8 ways to take beautiful photos of kids about a cup of jo welcome! a cup of jo is a daily lifestyle site for women. we cover everything from fashion to culture to parenthood, and we strive to be authentic. as olive kitteridge said, "there's no such thing as a simple life." thank you for reading. read more style food design travel relationships motherhood about contact faq let's hang out
