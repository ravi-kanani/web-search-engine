add clear product images to entice users to purchase an item. in a survey by statista of 1,372 u.s. online shoppers, researchers found that 87.6 percent of people felt clear product images equaled a positive shopping experience. photos ranked above even product reviews and descriptions. 6. pay attention to mobile responsiveness. in the same statista survey, around 48.4 percent of shoppers indicate they want ecommerce sites that are easy to use on mobile devices. if your site isn't already mobile-friendly, making it friendly to smaller screens is one of the top things you can do to improve your ux. the majority of people in the western world now have smartphones. many use their phones to access the internet and make purchases. if you aren't designing for mobile, you're missing out on a significant portion of your potential audience. 7. test your site. via giphy there is a big difference between what users think and what they actually do. they may say they want your site to offer more features but then use only one or two. digging into heatmaps and other site analytics helps you see what actions users take when they land on your pages. look at the elements they don't use and remove them if they aren't vital. 8. turn complex data into visuals. you know your business inside and out. you can tell a customer in 50 different ways why buying from you is the smart choice. you know more figures than a mathematician. unfortunately, this may overwhelm your site visitors. one way to help people process complex data is through the use of visual graphics. look at the data on your page. is any of it too advanced for a beginner? how can you present it in an infographic so that it's more digestible and easy to understand? 9. keep it short. there is a bit of a conundrum today. adobe reports that the average attention span today is around nine seconds or less. their advice is not to overwhelm users with information. however, google's algorithms seem to favor longer content, and some studies show that people are more engaged when you give them in-depth information. how do you balance the needs of short attention spans with the need for in-depth pieces? one method is breaking up longer pieces with h2 and h3 headings. add bullet points, images, infographics, videos, and anything you can think of to separate the text and keep the reader engaged. make things skimmable for the reader, and use descriptive headlines as well. ux is never finished start with the nine elements listed above to improve your ux instantly. however, keep in mind that user needs change, and you should always strive to make your site more user-centric. study patterns, try new things, split-test, and improve your site as long as it's in operation. with minor effort, your conversion rates should improve dramatically. leave a comment lexie lu lexie lu is a freelance graphic designer and blogger. she keeps up with the latest design news and always has some coffee in close proximity. she writes on design roast and can be followed on twitter @lexieludesigner. more marketing insights what is website accessibility?
