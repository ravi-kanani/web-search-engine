about us contact us link to us search for: 9 years of nerdy bookahs! 15mar 2020 6 comments i didn’t miss this year’s anniversary, but since we’re currently in the process of moving, there was simply no time to care about the blog – except for that short squeal of arenanet announcing a new expansion where i also completely missed the part with the teaser image hinting at cantha coming! to be honest, i have been thinking of stopping the blog. i’ve been writing fewer posts every year and since my main mmo is currently wow classic, there’s just not that much to talk about. even though it’s fun, there is just nothing new there. that’s the point of classic, after all. still, it’s a hobby of mine that i still like doing, so i won’t be going anywhere. i just have other priorities that need to be taken care of before i can sit down and write blog posts. in the end, other than buying the package that gets rid of the ads for my readers, it’s a hobby that doesn’t cost anything but lets me interact with others online. why quit, simply because i don’t feel like writing several times a week anymore, right? and when i look at the number up there… nine years. that is a lot of time that blogging has been part of my life and i’m sure that, even if i do only write a handful of posts a month, i would miss doing so if i stopped completely. so, i’m not going anywhere! and maybe i’ll even jump into new(er) and more exciting mmos in the future. new world is still on my watchlist. i like that they say they want to combine pve and pvp to co-exist and complementing each other. i am kind of imagining a warhammer online mindset. although i am worried that they made this decision only recently and are going to lauch very soon. and warhammer online wasn’t a success either… pve seemed like an after-thought in the high level regions. there is also still elder scrolls online where i haven’t seen much of the world yet and i can’t wait to explore it more deeply! but at the moment, i focus on bringing my warlock to level 60 in wow classic. so for the time being, i’ll remain more quiet while playing a game where i just have nothing interesting to talk about most of the time… but i am here and i’ll continue blogging… so, here’s to the next nine years, at least! share this: click to share on twitter (opens in new window) click to share on facebook (opens in new window) click to email this to a friend (opens in new window) click to share on whatsapp (opens in new window) click to share on pocket (opens in new window) more click to share on telegram (opens in new window) click to share on linkedin (opens in new window) click to print (opens in new window) click to share on reddit (opens in new window) click to share on pinterest (opens in new window) click to share on skype (opens in new window) click to share on tumblr (opens in new window) like this: like loading... related categories: fun! published by paeroka view all posts by paeroka tags: blog anniversary post navigation previous guild wars 2: third expansion coming! next lotro and ddo with free access to game content 6 comments atherenlightrunner says: 15 mar 2020 at 13:16 happy ninth anniversary! i recently reached 11 years on my original blog. it’s an accomplishment. keep writing whenever you have something to share! likeliked by 2 people reply paeroka says: 15 mar 2020 at 13:23 thank you. :) likeliked by 1 person reply rakuno says: 15 mar 2020 at 14:04 happy blogversary! :) likeliked by 1 person reply paeroka says: 15 mar 2020 at 14:19 thank you! likeliked by 1 person reply bhagpuss says: 15 mar 2020 at 16:23 happy anniversary! glad to hear you’re carrying on. i found wow calssic to be the opposite, while i was playing. it kicked up so many ideas for blog posts i couldn’t write them fast enough. it did slow down a bit at the higher levels but even then i think i could easily have found enough for several posts a week. gw2, on the other hand, i ran out of things to say about a good while ago. now it’s purely reactive, when they do something (usually something that annoys me). likeliked by 1 person reply paeroka says: 15 mar 2020 at 21:02 i’m mostly questing and grinding, so there’s no inspiration there. ;) i don’t have much to say about gw2 anymore either, but i only play through the new missions (although i think i didn’t do so with the latest ones… i can’t even remember!) and then leave again. likelike reply what do you think?
