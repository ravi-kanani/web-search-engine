our first book is… maybe you should talk to someone by lori gottlieb. in her funny, gripping memoir, gottlieb reveals what it’s really like to be a therapist. she talks to her patients — including a brash hollywood producer and a young newlywed with cancer — and shares the fascinating techniques she uses. meanwhile, out of her office, she’s going through a bad breakup and seeking help from a therapist herself. the book is thought-provoking, hilarious and completely absorbing. have you read it? or would you like to? we’ll chat about it on cup of jo on tuesday, april 14th (four weeks from now). please comment below if you’re on board! we’d love to have you. xoxo (top photo of maya angelou.) note: if you buy something through our links, we may earn an affiliate commission, at no cost to you. we recommend only products we genuinely like. thank you so much. march 17, 2020 3:16pm comments 930 you may also like… design what are you reading?
