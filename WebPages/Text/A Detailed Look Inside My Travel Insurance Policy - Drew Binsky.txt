change fee coverage $250.00 – if my flight dates get changed or switched around, this will reimburse. emergency medical and dental $50,000.00 – the most reassuring one for me is medical and dental coverage, because something bad can happen at any time while on the road. this provides coverage for any emergency medical or dental hospital visits when i’m away from home. trip cancellation protection $5,000.00 – should a trip be cancelled for a covered reason, this one provides reimbursement for non-refundable trip payments. once again, this is so nice for piece of mind because cancellations are really annoying and are out of my control! travel/trip delay coverage $1,500.00 – if one of my trips is delayed for 6 or more hours, this part reimburses for additional expenses, meals, accommodations etc. trip interruption protection $5,000.00 – should a trip be interrupted, reimbursement for the unused, non-refundable portion of my trip and for increased transportation costs to get home. travel accident coverage $50,000.00 – if something extreme happens, such as death, loss of sight, etc — the travel accident coverage offers a payment of $50k in cash. i feel really good knowing that i will be covered in all of the above categories if an unexpected emergency happens while i am abroad. and in addition to the extensive coverage in my plan, allianz travel insurance has excellent 24-hour customer service and friendly staff to be at your needs within seconds. i recommend getting their travelsmart app which will make everything accessible on your fingertips!
