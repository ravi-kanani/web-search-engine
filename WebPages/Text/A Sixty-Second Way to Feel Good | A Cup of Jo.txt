that really helped me, hearing that, hope it helps you too! march 18, 2020 11:06am / mary says... thank you i needed this! on top of everything going on in the news, my 2 year old is doing appointments with children national hospital to figure out some things and this morning i got news that his blood results were off and needed more investigation. he was seeing a neuromuscular doctor and cardiologist, now he has an appointment with a metabolic and genetic doctor at the end of march. i feel scared for what might be wrong, and also worried his appointment will be canceled or we will get sick going into the hospital. and then worried that if he needs to go again will there be a shortage in something he needs. or not able to have his blood draw. also what if they don’t let us travel from state to state at some point, and we can’t go from maryland to our appointments in washington dc. ugh it’s a challenging time for everyone but i feel like i am drowning in worry for my son and all that is going g on in the world, so deep calming breaths are very much needed. march 16, 2020 3:06pm / reply jenna says... this is just awful. i am thinking of you and your son. i don’t know how to stop all the worry but i hope we can take a bit of it on for you. march 16, 2020 6:17pm / cilla says... mary, sending you my love march 17, 2020 3:13am / shirley says... i’m so sorry mary. please continue taking deep breaths and try to focus on each moment. focus on the breath to bring yourself back from your worry as often as you need. try to focus on what you can control and let go of what you can’t. try to remain steady and calm for your child but remember that he is also allowed to see you as human, with emotions. focus on the color of your child’s eyes in the daylight. and the way he smiles at you at the end of the night when you put him to bed. tell him i love you as often as you can, but focus on the syllables themselves and what it may sound like to his ears. focus on your senses and have him focus on his too. have him carry a smooth rock or fuzzy bear or anything that he loves and ask him to rub the item whenever he feels scared or nervous. most of all, hang in there, and take care of yourself too. i’m a therapist and mindfulness teacher and really really hope some of these tips help. sending love and hoping your son is okay, xo, shirley march 17, 2020 6:13am / mary says... thank you all for your kind words and advice, really helpful and needed! i followed your tips shirley, and felt myself focusing on my child and the now, rather than everything going on, and what ifs about tmrw, which i realized was making me miss the lovely, wonderful moments of growth that he was having everyday in my stress. i also love the idea of him stroking something with a comforting texture when scared, all the masks really scare him and blood draws with people in masks can be intense so anything that helps… i am sad as his physical therapy practice is most likely closing soon, and he gets so much from that. i worry for the much more vulnerable children that go there that could regress if not in care long term, and the parents that are trying to cope working from home, as well as being home school teachers and now potentially therapists for there children while working full time. i cringe when i see people ignoring the guidelines and being out and about in groups, they are really hurting so many people in so many ways. but i am thankful for the many acts of kindness and love that are happening around the world, people coming together and helping each other, and the tiny everyday quite things that if not ignored can be so powerful. take care everyone! march 18, 2020 11:02am / sonia says... meera, virtual hug. you’ve got this. we’re rooting for you. in my darkest hours, i held on to simple, but oh-so true words: this too shall pass. you will overcome this, and be stronger for it. march 16, 2020 1:35pm / reply kiki says... huh, i think i’m too jaded by agency life. this just read like a terrible client brief to me…makes me want to rage just a tiny bit. lol. march 16, 2020 1:10pm / reply ellie says... she is fantastic! march 16, 2020 12:50pm / reply giulia says... a hug from me too! sending you love from london xxx march 16, 2020 12:43pm / reply meera says... my boyfriend that i thought i would spend forever with broke up with me suddenly, and with little preamble, a day before the recent increasing stay at home restrictions. i have a propensity for anxiety, depression and mania. while i know there are bigger things then me out there and am trying to do my part for the community, i’m really afraid about what the next two weeks confined at home, alone with no family, with nothing but my thoughts to dwell on in this difficult time, will do to me. i’ve always been so thankful for the coj readership and wonderful, supportive comments here and could really use a virtual hug at this time! love all of you and stay safe. march 16, 2020 12:24pm / reply robin says... sending a virtual hug. march 16, 2020 12:33pm / lauren says... thinking of you and sending hugs – you’re not alone <3 march 16, 2020 12:34pm / shila soni says... that sounds so hard meera. sending you virtual hugs and lots of love. take good care of yourself right now, you deserve it. march 16, 2020 12:35pm / dawn says... so sorry – sending hugs! break ups are tough and especially now, i am sure it will be even tougher. hang in there! you will get through this. march 16, 2020 12:50pm / jess. says... meera–hugging you! 2015 was my year of “things piling on,” and i want to tell you that i made it! and so can you! (i’m not just sending hugs, but real, genuine love) xox march 16, 2020 12:54pm / joanna goddard says... sending hugs to you, meera. that sounds really hard. you will get through this. xoxo march 16, 2020 1:25pm / dana says... hey meera. i also had a year of “things piling on”. it was horrible, even without the quarantine restrictions, so i can only imagine how crappy you must be feeling. sending you a huge hug and a suggestion…. during my horrible year, there was one thing i would kind of look forward to: each night, i would fill the tub with hot water, balance my laptop on the toilet (streaming something familiar and comforting– like friends or parenthood or the movie julie and julia. i must have watched that move a thousand times that year), and eat a bowl of ice cream while i soaked in the tub. sure– it didn’t really fix anything in my life. but it would trick me out of my obsessive thoughts for a little while. maybe it will help you too? <3 march 16, 2020 1:27pm / nicole says... try to keep busy. paint your bedroom a cheery color. bake some cookies. watch a whole season of a funny show. stay positive. call an old friend. march 16, 2020 1:27pm / nadine says... meera, it sounds really difficult. i have a propensity for depression and anxiety too and i’m struggling in this days to remember about the beautiful things in the world out there. if it can help you even for a moment, watching this video made me feel a bit lighter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ver8vy7us4s sending a virtual hug your way. march 16, 2020 1:28pm / eli says... you are so strong meera! hang in there – you’ll make it through to the other side. big hugs! march 16, 2020 1:31pm / amy says... meera – you are a star. don’t let anyone dim your light. sending you love. march 16, 2020 1:39pm / hilary says... hugs for you, meera! ❤️ march 16, 2020 2:07pm / neysa mendes says... big hug meera. might i suggest the boy, the mole, the fox and the horse by charlie mackesy . i thumb through and quickly enough i’ll find a page which really resonates with how i’m feeling/how i’d like to feel and it calms me a fair bit. march 16, 2020 2:42pm / liz says... sending a virtual hug! if you want a good cry (or several), may i suggest reading a little life? when i was dealing with a breakup, that book helped me let myself release my emotions. or if you want some humor, i love samantha irby :) you will get through this! it might suck! but you can do it!!! march 16, 2020 3:00pm / isabella says... i’m so sorry, meera — grieving the end of a serious relationship on top of all the current events is most definitely a case of too much piling on at once! sending hugs and support. i hope you have friends and family you can reach out to right now, and i hope you can find the strength and determination to do the reaching out; i know from my own struggles with depression how hard it can be to throw open a window and shout for help, but people do want to, and they love you, and the coj community has got your back! march 16, 2020 3:07pm / ginny says... sending love and light and peace to you <3 march 16, 2020 3:53pm / plant mom says... meera—you are stronger than this situation and i am right here beside you to ride this out and be a support! you are so loved by so many. xoxo, your former officemate, work wife and coj reading bestie (yes, it’s me) march 16, 2020 4:30pm / lizzie says... hi meera! a lot of folks have already posted great advice here, just wanted to add that it might help to set up a phone call or facetime date with a friend during this period. while you’re stuck at home alone, try to talk to someone every day. i bet even old friends would be happy to reconnect and you’ll be surprised how much better you feel after talking with someone. good luck and remember you are stronger than you know! sending a big hug! <3 march 16, 2020 5:09pm / emily says... thinking of you! i can’t imagine how painful and scary this must be. you are strong– you will get through this. think of this as a balm for your soul, a time you can cocoon yourself and do what makes you feel better. and don’t be afraid to reach out to trusted family, friends, or even strangers if you need anything. you are not alone. sending love your way ! march 16, 2020 5:50pm / annie says... i agree with isabella – try to get at least one phone call or facetime with a friend a day. it does not need to be a close friend – anyone will do, even if mundane topics. tell the people you are close with that you need a little extra from them right now. daily interaction helps to keep us grounded, even if virtual. sending you good vibes!!! march 16, 2020 8:21pm / jenniferinaustin says... sending a texas-sized hug your way, meera. xo march 16, 2020 8:42pm / katie says... this reminds me of the kids book press here. nice visualization. march 16, 2020 12:09pm / reply giulia says... this really helped. i’m pregnant, away from home (the north of italy) and in the uk, which is taking no reasonable precautions yet, so i am so terribly anxious. this truly helped. i will be going back to that beautiful blue if i feel panicky again. sending love to you all, and courage! xx giulia march 16, 2020 12:02pm / reply erika says... loved this, thank you! march 16, 2020 12:02pm / reply rusty says... i thought i didn’t want to do that … but … i did it anyway and it was good! :) march 16, 2020 11:43am / reply lauren e. says... same! thanks coj. sending you guys love. march 16, 2020 12:10pm / bc says... same! but i am so glad that i did :) march 16, 2020 12:52pm / joanna goddard says... it really was weirdly calming. march 16, 2020 1:24pm / m says... this was creative and nice, thanks! march 16, 2020 11:32am / reply amelia says... this is so great, thanks for sharing! march 16, 2020 11:29am / reply cancel reply comment name email website notify me of follow-up comments by email. about / contact joanna goddard brighten up your inbox let’s hang out contact me relationships most popular an update on my twin sister seeing my body with fresh eyes a secret to a happy marriage on sexual harassment how to write a condolence note how do you know your partner is the one?
