truly curious and not meant to be a troll post – wondering because i don’t consider madewell to be in that bucket. like i’m not saying they’re the most sustainable brand in the world or anything but i have madewell clothes that i’ve had for years and years – i find their quality hit or miss at times, for sure, especially sweaters/knits, but the pieces i have i would not consider them to be fast fashion? i find it has pretty good longevity. is it the price point? i guess in my mind stuff like h&m or f21 would be considered “fast fashion” but to me madewell is on par with like, levis or ralph lauren or something which i wouldn’t consider to be in that category. march 10, 2020 10:33pm / reply kelly says... quoting from the blog style-wise…”while madewell and its parent company, j crew, have a standard corporate social responsibility document in place, there is no evidence that the brand enforces these policies. in fact, a cursory search on google will render multiple results for evidence of sweatshop labor. this doesn’t mean that the j crew-madewell conglomerate is worse than most conventional brands, but it does mean they’re not prioritizing sustainable practices in their supply chain (though, according to a recent fashionista article, the new ceo is working to get sustainability and fair trade certifications for j crew brands). so you have a couple options: –if you’re a madewell super fan, email them and let them know that you’d like greater transparency and attention to ethics in their supply chain. your voice matters. –if you’re ready to find some ethical alternatives, use the list i’ve compiled to shop. see this blog article: https://stylewise-blog.com/ethical-brands-that-are-better-than-madewell/ update: madewell just released a fair trade certified denim line produced at saitex, the same company everlane uses.” march 11, 2020 10:53am / a says... thanks kelly! i’m still confused, your response is helpful around the sustainability element but does that mean then that all brands that aren’t considered to be sustainable = fast fashion? i thought fast fashion pertained to companies that made clothes that were meant to be somewhat “disposable” march 16, 2020 9:19am / julie says... she is so pretty and stylish. i just wish madewell was made in the usa. it is mostly made in china and the quality doesn’t seem that great. prices are high; i know they’re not alone manufacturing in china but i’m just trying to stay away from it. march 10, 2020 10:02pm / reply luísa says... i love her style!!! but that picture with joyce and panda facing the same way omg ❤︎❤︎❤︎❤︎❤︎ march 10, 2020 9:20pm / reply chicks says... love those green pants. plus panda is one cool cat. march 10, 2020 7:22pm / reply kelly says... trying to think if there’s a better job than head designer for madewell?!? march 10, 2020 6:43pm / reply kristin says... oooooh love this. and those as ever pants are to die for! march 10, 2020 6:19pm / reply kris says... she is the coolest! i want more- can we please see her apartment and know her beauty routine, please please? march 10, 2020 5:34pm / reply caroline says... yes, apartment please! march 10, 2020 9:37pm / sya says... second that with a passion! march 10, 2020 11:26pm / becca says... i second that! love her style. march 11, 2020 1:27am / abby says... agreed! was just about to request this ! march 11, 2020 6:54am / sara says... yes please! march 11, 2020 10:23am / claire says... this is my favorite part: ” i’m not going to suffer for fashion. you should feel like yourself in what you’re wearing.” also- i’m with poppy: i love a long dress. you have an awesome cat too! march 10, 2020 5:08pm / reply karinyvr says... have you seen greed, the movie by michael winterbottom-it’s a black comedy about how clothing is made overseas on the backs of women & children. you’ll change your shopping habits if you see it! love the apartment march 10, 2020 5:07pm / reply carrie says... i’ve never seen anyone rock a jumper so hard before. looks so cute on her march 10, 2020 5:00pm / reply amy says... love love love her apartment! march 10, 2020 4:22pm / reply eleanorfrances says... ditto on the apartment tour please. march 10, 2020 3:46pm / reply d says... i love her style and i love her cat. :) march 10, 2020 3:27pm / reply stephanie says... love her style! i need a link to that chic cat scratcher/basket! march 10, 2020 3:23pm / reply heather says... where is that beautiful couch from!? march 10, 2020 2:44pm / reply joanna goddard says... abc carpet and home! march 10, 2020 2:45pm / courtney says... apartment tour please! march 10, 2020 2:15pm / reply ceridwen says... yes! march 10, 2020 3:14pm / jill says... yes, please! march 10, 2020 4:05pm / poppy says... lovely! are those vitsoe bookshelves? i just ordered mine and can’t wait to install them. march 10, 2020 2:11pm / reply verena says... you’ll love them! the best purchase we ever made! the only thing is you’re getting addicted: we are planning the third ‘batch’ now… march 11, 2020 3:48pm / milka says... i love her style and totally agree that monochrome is always a winner! sadly, i’ve had to give up madewell because it doesn’t fit with my goals of buying sustainable fashion. i’ve been loving the motto (which i learned from cuyana via coj!!) “fewer, better things”. i would love to see a post about someone who’s given up fast fashion… i’m trying to commit to that! march 10, 2020 2:11pm / reply joanna goddard says... we have an ethical fashion week of outfits coming up next! xo march 10, 2020 2:34pm / judy a greene says... i totally agree. have you seen the documentary https://truecostmovie.com/ ever since seeing this documentary and learning more about fast fashion, i am avoiding companies like zara and h&m. thank you for raising the issue of sustainable fashion in your comment milka. and thanks coj for having an ethical fashion week post coming up. lemlem.com is an amazing company for example march 10, 2020 3:52pm / meredith says... milka, are you allowing yourself to purchase things secondhand? i have a few madewell pieces i have found in thrift stores and resale shops that i have enjoyed wearing for years :) i am also interested in giving up fast fashion and have mostly focused on purchasing new to me items from thredup, goodwill, and a local resale shop called clothes mentor. but i am very interested in how others approach it and would love to hear more about your technique! march 10, 2020 4:02pm / adley says... thanks for saying this- and thanks for responding coj! couldn’t agree more. march 10, 2020 4:29pm / eloise says... keep an eye (and ear) out for this (podcast is “everything is fine”): https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/category/but-i-digress/ march 10, 2020 4:42pm / sasha l says... thank you eloise for pod cast rec, and meredith for bringing up second hand. i guess i’m lucky that *fashion* just doesn’t speak to me anymore? maybe it’s achieving a certain age (47), or just what clothes look like currently, but i just don’t like any of it. i’d rather pick through a few racks at a thrift store if i truly need something than buy new anything i see here, or anywhere else. everything new looks simultaneously boring and impractical, which seems like a tall order actually. maybe i’m just too concerned about larger issues? anyway, if you haven’t tried, thrifting is a diverting little treasure hunt, and the only clothing choice that is actually ethical. march 10, 2020 6:23pm / lillian says... her lipstick! need makeup and apartment tour like everyone is saying. march 10, 2020 1:25pm / reply monika says... i just look at white clothes and food magically appears on them…what is her secret?!? she is clearly magic… march 10, 2020 1:24pm / reply eliza says... and i can never keep yellow armpit stains away – i don’t use a deodorant with aluminum and i bought a new white shirt when i was using an all natural deodorant for a year and the pits still turned yellow. i find it impractical (for me) to buy white because i can’t make it last! march 11, 2020 11:53am / sydni jackson says... random suggestion – looking at that third photo made me think, you should do bookshelf tours! i love to see what other people are reading :) march 10, 2020 1:07pm / reply j says... i love this idea!! march 10, 2020 1:34pm / erin says... yes please! march 10, 2020 1:39pm / agnès says... oh yes! do we have two new categories here? artists and bookshelves! yeeeeaaa! march 10, 2020 1:57pm / katie says... great idea!!!! or something like “10 books that changed xxxxx’a life.” i would love something like that!! march 10, 2020 2:23pm / michelle says... love this idea 💡 march 10, 2020 2:27pm / jill says... yes to artists and bookshelves! march 10, 2020 4:11pm / jq says... i’ve never posted a comment here before…but i need to know where that couch is from! haha march 10, 2020 12:56pm / reply arielle says... omg my first thought, too! march 10, 2020 1:22pm / joanna goddard says... joyce says: “abc carpet and home — it was a treat purchase when we bought our apartment.” march 10, 2020 2:01pm / jenny says... she’s amazing and her style is so effortless! that hair!!!!! am i alone, though, in feeling like madewell just… isn’t for me anymore? i’m 31, so possibly just aged out. but i loved all of their tomboy staples and suddenly the fabrics feel cheaper (not the prices though!) and there are ruffles on everything. i miss the tomboy stuff in fresh silhouettes and nice materials. march 10, 2020 12:54pm / reply slr says... agreed. i’m older than you so i am used to aging out of stores to an extent. i thought madewell’s simple style would continue to work, but everything has been cropped (and i’m only 5’4″) and/or ruffled for the past several years. i’ve sworn off of ordering…except for bags. i love them still. march 10, 2020 2:05pm / joaquina says... i feel that way about madewell and anthropologie! guess i’ve aged out of both so am looking elsewhere. march 10, 2020 2:07pm / alexandra says... not to disagree (perhaps they’re really just not your style anymore!) but i have noticed the way madewell’s styles vary a lot by season. sometimes their current options are right up my alley, sometimes they’re not. ruffles might go out of style soon :) march 10, 2020 2:43pm / mary says... just something funny – i just turned 30 and just now feel like i’ve “grown into” madewell lol march 11, 2020 10:36am / danielle says... my mom (60) where 10x more madewell than i (31) do! i like it, but i try to avoid the trend pieces and stick with jeans, the short sleeve button down shirts whose name escapes me and the bags now. funny you should say that about anthropologie. mother dearest worked there for many years and would routinely make huge sales to women her own age. loads of happy customers. yet now they seem to focus on younger and younger (lots of influencer posts) which wasn’t their initial target audience or actual audience. (i worked there for years as well) march 11, 2020 2:52pm / ar says... what beautiful skin!! would love to know her skincare/beauty regime. march 10, 2020 12:43pm / reply maud says... yes! house tour please!! march 10, 2020 12:33pm / reply audrey says... yes more on joyce’s career and apartment! she seems so interesting! march 10, 2020 12:20pm / reply ae says... this made me click submit on the madewell carr i’ve had open for 2 weeks. i blame you, jo! her style is so good. march 10, 2020 12:09pm / reply beth says... i spotted a photograph of white sands national park in new mexico on the wall in her 2nd photo! ;-) i know those iconic picnic tables having grown up in southern new mexico. march 10, 2020 11:59am / reply wendy says... i also have the same body type as her and felt inspired after seeing this!!! she’s so cool. also, please do an apartment tour with joyce! i kept looking through these gorgeous photos and saying to myself, “ok, but those pillows. that chair.” march 10, 2020 11:53am / reply tania says... undersigned! march 10, 2020 12:09pm / kristin says... yes, to this!! :) march 10, 2020 12:26pm / amanda says... good call. i would love to see a house tour too! her outfits are great. march 10, 2020 1:08pm / erin says... it’s hans wegner’s folding chair, pp512 :) march 10, 2020 1:47pm / jackie says... i want more! how did she make it to the top at madewell? what are her boss tips? life by joyce, please! march 10, 2020 11:53am / reply celeste says... second! march 10, 2020 12:21pm / sydni jackson says... yeah, unfortunately i feel like we didn’t learn a lot about her in this interview. but she seems so cool. march 10, 2020 1:08pm / jo says... third!! please do a series on boss women – how they got there and tips to stay there while being a great boss to their reports march 10, 2020 1:52pm / joanna goddard says... yes, of course! here’s a note from joyce: “i try to be as honest and transparent with my team — i’ve always appreciated that as well and feel like it goes a long way in building trust and strong working relationships. i also like to strike a balance between being a ‘boss’ and being a ‘human.'” march 10, 2020 2:02pm / abbey says... i love how i feel wearing white… but the “you can just wash it” trick doesn’t seem to work!! hahaha! there was another week of outfits last year with a woman who also liked to wear a lot of white (even with kids) and she said the same thing! what’s the trick?? she even recommended a natural stain stick that i’ve tried and it does not work for me at all. what am i missing?? btw this is the most boring comment ever. i know. laundry questions. really. i really love joyce’s style and i’ll thank her every time i am wearing madewell which is pretty much every day. thanks, joyce!! ;) march 10, 2020 11:50am / reply heather says... abbey, i have four kids, and i’ve learned so much about getting out stains. blood comes out easily if you throw a piece of ice on it or soak anything with blood in ice water. is it’s still there, i’ll spray with oxiclean stain spray and wash. trick is to treat before you wash. once it’s gone through the dryer, that stain is probably here to stay. for mud, grass, dirt or grease, treat the stain with dawn dish soap – the classic blue one. wash and then allow to air dry to make sure stain is gone. if not, repeat. i’ve used dawn for old grease stains too. if clothes get really muddy or grass stained, rinse off with sink sprayer first to get rid of any loose dirt. i’ve been known to spray down muddy pants in the driveway with a hose. and a good soak in oxiclean powder and water can work wonders. march 10, 2020 12:20pm / kara says... not boring, abbey, i literally had the same thought/question! thanks for the tips, heather! march 10, 2020 1:10pm / lauren e. says... i’m with you on the white – i always somehow get weird spots on my butt from sitting, and i just generally feel like a slob. march 10, 2020 1:14pm / tess says... abbey- i feel you!! i don’t even have kids and i feel like i can’t really have anything white in my wardrobe, especially if it is expensive! also- how do people have white sheets?? i feel like i missed a day in how to adult school. march 10, 2020 1:15pm / jen says... abbey — i feel you! just this morning i read a post about how to wear white clothes year round and felt so much hope. hah! https://www.justgoodshit.com/blog/how-to-wear-white-clothes-get-stains-out i’m going to try her suggestions with some cheaper clothing first. :) march 10, 2020 1:18pm / kathryn says... shout and drying in the sunshine generally do the trick for me, also changing when i get home. i have found, however, the only thing i can’t get out of white is ,strangely, bubble solution. some bubbles, if they pop on your white clothes will leave these little tiny dark dots that show up after you wash and dry them, and they never come out. i ruined a favorite dress with bubbles. march 10, 2020 1:33pm / christina says... kathryn, so true! so many of my childrens’ clothes got ruined before i discovered why! bubble solution doesn’t come out of anything, no matter colour or material, it’s awful. i only let my children play with bubbles wearing already ruined clothes once i knew this, and never near me. so sad. march 10, 2020 1:43pm / joanna goddard says... says joyce: “oxiclean when it’s dire, but otherwise, i’m not precious about my whites! i like my whites to look lived-in so maybe that’s why it works. haha.” march 10, 2020 2:02pm / emily says... remember to dry your whites in the sun. the sun bleaches stains. it really helps. march 10, 2020 2:11pm / sasha l says... i’m surprised no one has mentioned bleach?!? if you consistently bleach your whites, well, they stay white. other than that you can do all the spot stain removal tricks, but your whites will still become dingy over time. march 11, 2020 1:09pm / abbey says... woohoo! so many great tips! i’m glad i posed my boring question :) march 11, 2020 2:44pm / marie says... her style is super cute, and it all looks great on her! but as a past customer of madewell, who really needs a new pair of jeans, i am begging you, please please make some mid-rise jeans again. thank you! march 10, 2020 11:48am / reply sally says... this is exactly what i came here to say too — no more high waisted only jeans!!!! i love madewell jeans as a whole, they are the only kind i wear, but i hate high waisted jeans and am dying for this trend to freaking end, already. please make mid or even low rise jeans, anything but all high waisted. march 10, 2020 3:48pm / roseann says... perhaps you can find some secondhand on poshmark? march 11, 2020 1:21am / lori k says... yes, please, please, please! i am short-waisted and high rise jeans look ridiculous on me. march 11, 2020 8:02pm / k says... she is stunning!! march 10, 2020 11:47am / reply joanne says... i feel like there needs to be a follow-up showcasing this apartment! it’s lovely. march 10, 2020 11:44am / reply b says... yes, please! and a beauty uniform! march 10, 2020 12:18pm / sara nelson says... house tour, pretty please with a cherry on top! march 10, 2020 11:32am / reply chandra says... she’s gorge! house tour por favor. march 10, 2020 11:27am / reply ellen says... so happy to see someone with the exact same body type and size as me! i’d love love love to know how she styled herself through pregnancy. i’m pregnant with my second and struggling yet again with a short torso and not being able to tuck anything into maternity jeans! without a waist, i look like an egg with long legs. :p march 10, 2020 11:21am / reply hannah g says... it’s so (sartorially) frustrating being short and pregnant right now when the styles are all high-waisted, tucked, and cropped, or beautifully oversized a la hatch. just a fellow preggo shortie that needed to comiserate. march 10, 2020 3:49pm / jessica says... ok but this apartment. this apartment. march 10, 2020 11:15am / reply kate says... i second that! can you ask her where is her couch from? love it. march 10, 2020 11:51am / tricia says... yes! march 10, 2020 11:53am / louisa says... for your next week of outfits could you pick someone in her mid-40’s, 5’10” or taller, very long waisted, 2 muddy dogs and one artistic kindergartener, who needs to get ready in under 15 minutes (including a shower)? maybe someone who loves to wear simple dresses but wants them knee-length or longer, and only wears exceedingly comfortable shoes? and is waaaay more stylish than me? just a thought. thanks. march 10, 2020 11:11am / reply joanna goddard says... hahaha we will try! love a challenge :) march 10, 2020 12:01pm / hannah says... louisa, are you my twin? i second and third this! for me, minus the muddy dogs but plus 30 lbs i need to desperately lose. thanks! march 10, 2020 12:12pm / erin says... i second everything about louisa’s request. bonus points if the person has figured out how to find comfortable and stylish shoes for her freakishly narrow feet. ;) march 10, 2020 12:19pm / quinn says... haha, this is the best! :) i’m much shorter but can definitely relate on a couple of fronts – especially the exceedingly comfortable shoes! :) march 10, 2020 12:39pm / jen says... that’s basically me, too! on the shoes front — clarks originals makes some super comfortable and very cool looking shoes. i always get compliments. simple, longer dresses that are also stylish — try british brands joules or boden, lots of options and generally have pretty good sales. for hair – ask for a shag cut. i told my stylist i needed something that took 5 minutes but made it appear i spent much longer. a shag cut has exceeded my expectations all around. march 10, 2020 1:23pm / bev says... i have never commented before, but this speaks to me – maybe because we are very similar (but substitute another toddler for the dogs, although they are probably equally muddy creatures)! bonus points if i can copy these outfits to wear in an business casual work environment :) march 10, 2020 1:29pm / kelly says... simple dresses, knee-length or longer, and comfortable shoes is the best way to describe my wardrobe. with a current need for them to be breastfeeding friendly and a goal of them being sustainably made. sigh. two brands i’m loving are: –pyne and smith dresses –ace & jig (these can be pricey, but i’ve had luck on secondhand sites) march 10, 2020 2:10pm / ginny early says... haha, yes! i am torn between saying that i would be great for this post, and that i neeeeeed this post. i’m39, 6’1″ tall, two kids, and i’m a floral designer. i get super messy from work, my hands are always destroyed from flowers and thorns, yet i still need to look cool and presentable for clients after i’ve spent alllllll day (all week, really) sweating through their floral installations. i’ve got a few good tricks up my sleeve to make things work, but i could always use more advice! march 10, 2020 4:14pm / amy says... my life is this! check out carlyjeanlosangeles.com for great, stylish, not too expensive dresses! and they are mostly knee length or longer. love their stuff! march 10, 2020 6:42pm / kylie says... yes! please. march 10, 2020 7:45pm / molly says... @ louisa, are we the same person?!!? i only have one muddy dog, but she is a big one that feels like 2. aside from that we have a lot in common. march 10, 2020 8:01pm / rebecca says... yes to all. i’m loving the dress recommendations in the comments. keep em coming! also, what the heck to do with wet hair as you’re running out the door? i’m braid-challenged and cannot for the life of me figure out the hand motions to make those awesome side braids, french braids, etc. that allow you to start your day with damp hair. march 11, 2020 2:08am / cynthia says... i adore the gingham dress, and it’s great that she’s all about comfort. march 10, 2020 11:07am / reply becky says... i’m also 5’4″, cuff my pants, like high waisted pants and love a front tuck! i’ve been thinking lately how much i do not love skinny jeans/jeggings anymore. they have seriously given me body image issues. it was so great to see non skinny pants in this post! i recently bough a pair of mens skinny jeans and cut off the extra length and they are the perfect non skinny pant on me. men’s jeans, who knew! march 10, 2020 11:33am / becky says... sorry cynthia! i meant that as it’s own reply! march 10, 2020 11:34am / karen says... even her couch looks so relaxed, in that “come sit on me” way. i can always tell someone is comfortable in my house when they sit on their legs when on my couch. i bet everyone does that when they visit joyce! :) march 10, 2020 11:04am / reply amy says... as a fellow short person, she may have no choice but to tuck her legs up when she sits on that couch – it looks so deep haha! i’m either leaning waaaay back if my feet are touching the floor, bringing my legs up, or finding a pillow to go behind me for back support. it’s like being a kid again when i’m on a deep couch. march 10, 2020 1:45pm / liz says... great style! love her hair too! march 10, 2020 11:03am / reply amy says... the first dress!! so. good. march 10, 2020 10:52am / reply cancel reply comment name email website notify me of follow-up comments by email. about / contact joanna goddard brighten up your inbox let’s hang out contact me style most popular my packing list for our england trip seven everyday clothes i swear by my beauty uniform: samin nosrat messy side ponytail what shoes do you wear to work?
