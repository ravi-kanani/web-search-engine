i’ve playing around with this style and i also came up with another version with all my hair up because some days wearing your hair down just doesn’t work, or it’s just a mess, and you would like to put it all up. or maybe that’s just me…? whatever your hair is doing, you can adapt this crown braid tutorial to suit you. all you need are some bobby pins and a small hair elastic. so let’s jump into the video. a new way to wear a crown braid – hairstyle tutorial video: click here if you can’t see the video above styling tips: your hair is too slippery: try a little bit of hairspray or dry shampoo to give your hair some texture before you braid. your pins are slipping out: spray a bit of that dry shampoo or hairspray onto your bobby pins to stop them slipping as well. your layers are poking out: i have layers too and stretching out the braid in just the right way helps me tuck them in and hide them within the braid. if your layers are still poking out, take a bobby pin and spray it with a little bit of hairspray or dry shampoo and then hook the layers to hide them back into the braid with your pin. or just embrace them! i love a messy braid and i don’t mind seeing a few poking out pieces. some exciting news! i’ve been featured on youtube as one of their ‘creators on the rise’ which is so exciting. i used to be very nervous about making videos (and still am sometimes!) but i know it’s the easiest way to show you exactly what i’m doing. i get it as i’m a visual learner too. and i don’t know if you have noticed, but i have been posting regular videos every thursday (and i’m impressed with myself for keeping with the schedule!). i’ve already got a few videos planned and if you’ve got any suggestions on what you would like to see, i’d love to hear from you in the comments. if you want to hang out and chat more, you should also join the hair romance crew on facebook. it’s a place to ask questions and share hair tips and it’s full of some of the most beautiful women. i just love this group, and i hope to see you there too. have fun with your hair!
