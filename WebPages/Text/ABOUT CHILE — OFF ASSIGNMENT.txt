(i was lying under a truck, switching a tire, and he stopped to offer help.) i described some of the journeys we subsequently made together as i moved southwards. we visited the fray jorge rainforest on the north coast, and walked among tiny purple and yellow flowers and clammy creepers which clung around our ankles. we put up his ancient tent on an uninhabited island and cooked up illegally caught locos, a chilean mollusk with no name in english. the island was full of cactus fruit, black lizards, whale skulls, and boobies nesting in the cliffs. as for josé—he had black curly hair, blue eyes, and a slow smile. he was a bit of a tantric guru, but that’s enough about that. i was 30, he was 32. i was making my way as a writer, he was an unreconstructed hippie working on an environmental project. pinochet was no longer in charge of the country, but he was still head of the army, adored by pocket demagogues on both sides of the andes. josé and i had many talks about his country and its recent history. get the off assignment newsletter be the first to know what else writers didn't say. email address write me thank you! although an astute reader can deduce from the pages of travels in a thin country that josé and i were lovers on the road, i wrote nothing about that side of our friendship. i felt it was nobody’s business, and that inference can be best in travel literature. when we got to santiago, i smuggled him on a private tour of the moneda palace, where pinochet’s hawker hunters had murdered the democratically elected president salvador allende in 1973. josé was annoyed that the authorities allowed foreigners in, but kept chileans out, so i got him accredited as my photographer. i remember he turned up with a brownie camera, circa 1970. we both knew i had to leave chile at a certain point, and that there was no realistic prospect of either of us moving continents in the future. little was said on the topic. once i finally got back to london, there were some letters (this was before the internet)—his were always funny and engaging, embroidered with little drawings of birds and animals we had seen on our travels together. i’d love to know what happened to him, now that we are both marooned in quite different lives, in our 50s, facing the downhill catwalk of old age. i learned a lot from him—about chile, and about love affairs. sometimes they unfurl in a perfect bubble, which pops, when the clock stops ticking, without any anguish at all. about the author sara wheeler’s books include the best-selling terra incognita: travels in antarctica, access all areas: selected writings, 1990-2010, and most recently o my america!: second acts in a new world. her works have been translated into many languages and she is a regular contributor to broadsheet newspapers in the uk and us and occasionally broadcasts on bbc radio. she lives in london. she would not recommend visiting venice in the summer. read more articles mar 25, 2020 sarah rovang to the man named "praise god" mar 25, 2020 sarah rovang mar 25, 2020 sarah rovang mar 11, 2020 lavinia spalding to the shopkeeper in fez mar 11, 2020 lavinia spalding mar 11, 2020 lavinia spalding feb 27, 2020 alexander lumans how not to leave the arctic circle feb 27, 2020 alexander lumans feb 27, 2020 alexander lumans feb 12, 2020 sarah perry to the man i made into a stranger feb 12, 2020 sarah perry feb 12, 2020 sarah perry jan 23, 2020 off assignment behind the briefings: elaina plott jan 23, 2020 off assignment jan 23, 2020 off assignment jan 9, 2020 ruth knafo setton to the nun who locked eyes with me jan 9, 2020 ruth knafo setton jan 9, 2020 ruth knafo setton dec 19, 2019 sarah ruth bates to the host mother of the do-gooders dec 19, 2019 sarah ruth bates dec 19, 2019 sarah ruth bates nov 21, 2019 kate essig to the fenix who commanded authority nov 21, 2019 kate essig nov 21, 2019 kate essig nov 7, 2019 jim mattson to the woman looking for the hospital nov 7, 2019 jim mattson nov 7, 2019 jim mattson oct 24, 2019 leora fridman to the dancer who touched my back oct 24, 2019 leora fridman oct 24, 2019 leora fridman photo by dick culbert sara wheeler facebook0 twitter linkedin0 about honfleur what i didn't saymarcia desanctisfebruary 09, 2017100 places in france every woman should goarchives 2 to the woman on the park bench lettersaviya kushnerfebruary 02, 2017new york, cityarchives 2 © off assignment / offassignment@gmail.com
