advanced custom fields in version 5 (also free). acf below version 5 has a different data structure in database and is not supported. in what fields does the plugin search? our plugin supports the following fields: text, text area, number, email, url, file, wysiwyg editor, select, checkbox and radio button. all these fields may be located in both the repeater or flexible content field. how does this work? plugin changes all sql queries by extending the standard search to selected fields of advanced custom fields. the plugin in admin panel works same as for the search page. it works for wp_query class. do i need to add some arguments to my function to activate advanced search? everythings works automatically. for custom wp_query loop and get_posts() function also if you add search parameter. how does searching for whole phrases? the default search in wordpress is to search for each of words listed. this feature allows you to search for occurrences of the whole phrase entered in the search field without word division. how does lite mode work? in this mode, the plugin does not check the field types. phrases are searched in all acf fields. thanks to this, the query to the database is smaller and faster by about 25%. however, we do not have control over which fields are taken into account when searching. is the plugin completely free? yes. the plugin is completely free. however, working on plugins and technical support requires many hours of work. if you want to appreciate it, you can provide us a coffee. thanks everyone! thank you for all the ratings and reviews. if you are satisfied with this plugin, please recommend it to your friends. every new person using our plugin is valuable to us. this is all very important to us and allows us to do even better things for you! reviews such an easy solution visualpeople march 16, 2020 i'm not a fan of a uni-tasker plugin to do things that a line of code in a functions.php file could do. but this is not one of those plugins. the ability to get search functionality with so many options easily added to a site is so well executed. great job. the acf search works really well sparkem march 14, 2020 needed to search specific fields in acf and this plugin makes it easy to do. highly recommend. just used it .. it worked webkiwinz february 27, 2020 we write web sites using acf fields to allow clients to have an easier management experience. we also use acf to format schema text and structured data. we couldn't search wysiwyg, reviews, and other fields. now we can. installed it, activated it, selected lite mode, re-ran the search and it worked. thanks - there's a coffee coming your way a great plugin george kalantzopoulos february 23, 2020 it works really well. great search plugin, so simple to use yourskipper february 8, 2020 just installed and it worked, exactly what i needed üôÇ great plugin ialoudat february 7, 2020 this plugin easy to used, and powerful, thanks for this grate plugin read all 74 reviews contributors & developers ‚Äúacf: better search‚Äù is open source software. the following people have contributed to this plugin.contributors mateusz gbiorczyk ‚Äúacf: better search‚Äù has been translated into 2 locales. thank you to the translators for their contributions. translate ‚Äúacf: better search‚Äù into your language. interested in development?
