i can tell you that, for years and years, i hated my hair. then i had a haircut that changed my life. i also met my husband in the same street that i met my hairdresser, and that’s where my two great romances began. i started this site in 2010 to share my hair romance and i blog with my husband at mr & mrs romance. you see, i used to fight with my hair and pretend that it wasn’t curly. i wanted it to be straight. my hair has a mind of its own and would rebel against every style i tried. then i finally found a hairdresser who understood my hair. he cut it differently to anyone else and my hair looked amazing. i started to love my hair and it loved me back. it would stay in place, and would even let me straighten it every now and then. i believe your hair is your best accessory. you wear your hair every day, and you should have fun with your hair. you might think all this hair and beauty talk means i spend a lot of time on my hair but it’s not the case. the secret to good hair is a great haircut. it will save you time each morning as it will be easy to style and suit your lifestyle. all my tutorials are quick and usually work better in ‘second-day’ hair as i prefer to sleep in for 15 more minutes than to wash my hair. i do all the hairstyles in my own hair and i take all the photos too. i’m not a hairdresser and i don’t have any special training, so if i can do it, i know you can too. some of my favourite go-to hairstyles are: the classic twist & pin (be kind, it was my first video!) crown braided hairstyle the giant top knot (which works even if you don’t have a lot of hair) side braided hairstyle (which features my pink ombre hair) 5 ways to wear a scarf and a top knot french roll twist & pin hairstyle more popular posts on hair romance are: love your hair how to grow out a pixie cut braids for short hair how to make your hair grow faster should you have a signature hairstyle?
