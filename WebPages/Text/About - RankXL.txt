authority seo 2.0 blog about tools contact hi, i’m chris 👋🏻 i love building and scaling content businesses. 🙋🏻‍♂️ about me: i built my first website in 2009 on a dusty, old pc desktop. since then, i’ve been obsessed with seo and using it to grow and scale traffic to websites. my first business model was to rank niche sites on google for high search volume keywords and then monetize with adsense. i loved the model. it was passive, easy, and i was getting pretty good at it. within a year, i had built up a portfolio of a few websites that were collectively making $300-$400 per month. my adsense payments were paying for my car lease and it felt incredible. it felt so cool receiving a cheque from google. even though i wasn’t technically working for google, i felt like some kind of insider. i knew something that none of my friends knew about. i was good at something that was making money. i was getting paid for sitting at my computer. i was making money even when i was sleeping. i was addicted. i was determined to learn more and turn seo into my career. 2 years later, i worked as an seo consultant, as a freelancer, working with local businesses to get more traffic from google search. a year after that, i worked as a full-time seo specialist at a local marketing firm in my city, all the while building my own sites on the side. 2013 was a break-through year for me. it was the year i first crossed $1000/month with my sites. thanks to seo. while other people’s rankings were destroyed from google’s panda and penguin updates, my main websites soared in rankings. i decided then and there that i would drop every other strategy i was trying out and just focus on building out more sites. and that decision was the best one that i made in my career. that year, i reached my goal of hitting $100/day. and after 5 months, i quit my job and have been doing seo, and building websites for a living ever since. it’s now been nearly a decade since the day i put up my first websites. today, i’m still passionate about seo as ever. i love building and scaling content sites. and the rush and challenge of growing a new site to 100,000 visitors never goes away. thanks for reading 🙏 update, may 2019: rankxl has been acquired by alpha investors. alpha investors is the leader in the industry when it comes to building profitable authority websites and ai is also very active in the buying/selling online businesses marketplace. their ceo, andrej ilisin, will take over the day-to-day operations here at rankxl and continue where chris left off. the main goal behind this acquisition is to improve the overall performance of rankxl and its courses. zero to 100k with seo a free 5-part seo email course that will show you step-by-step how to grow traffic from zero to 100,000 visitors per month (with search). sign me up © 2019 rankxl. all rights reserved. | contact | twitter zero to 100k with seo free 5-part mini-course. enter your email to get lesson #1. email* send me the first lesson enter your email below to get the zero to 100k mini-course email* send me the first lesson
