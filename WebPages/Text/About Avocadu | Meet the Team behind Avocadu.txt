hey there! my name is lauren and i pretty much run the show over here at avocadu — with the help of my business partner (let’s call him the lights crew). my health journey really began when i was in college. my dorm was near the gym, and that’s when i really fell in love with running. even back in college, i started drinking non-dairy milk alternatives and was eager to learn anything i could about healthy eating. just a couple of years later, i became a pretty hardcore vegan. i was also gluten-free and ate about a 70% raw diet. after living that lifestyle for about two years, i slowly came out of it, although i never really got back into the dairy stuff. i’ve also tried paleo, keto, pescetarian, and pretty much every diet out there! i love to read health books and i love learning about and trying different diets. on the fitness side, i do still have a passion for running, but i do it more now more as a method of meditation. i love to put my headphones in, listen to music that makes me feel great, and hit the pavement. but one thing i love far more than running is yoga. i got into yoga a few years ago and was hooked. i think it’s one of the best ways to stay fit and toned and i honestly love the constant challenge that yoga presents. i’m always challenged and the strength and flexibility involved allows you to see your progress in real-time. i particularly have a passion for all types of inversions — especially forearm stands and handstands! to me, the feeling of going upside down is unlike any other. as you can see, i’ve been passionate about health and wellness and fitness most of my life now. when i met my business partner, we knew that starting a health and wellness blog to share our knowledge was what we wanted to do. he is a cscs certified personal trainer and issa nutrition specialist and has also been in love with health and fitness all of his life. why start avocadu? when we first met, we were two completely different people at the time… i was a card-carrying vegan with a passion for long-distance running, and he was a personal trainer who loved lifting weights and eating lots of delicious meats. over time, we began to challenge each other’s viewpoints on certain subjects. we didn’t realize it at the time, but our two different perspectives helped sharpen us on what was really going on in the health and wellness space. we stumbled upon some interesting statistics about the ever-growing problems in the health and wellness industry: the average dieter tries 4-5 diets per year. less than ½ of 1% of those dieters are successful in their long-term weight loss goals. health and fitness is a trillion-dollar industry, yet 70% of americans are overweight and 40% are obese. those 3 statistics alone boggled our heads a little bit. imagine if only ½ of 1% of kids graduated high school?? that’s an outright problem, not a minor issue. something is very wrong with the health and wellness industry. doing more research and from our own personal experience, we noticed some strange things. things in both the plant-eating community and amongst the carnivores. maybe some of these will resonate with you: so many myths, scams, and outright lies exist that people have just become completely immune to the meaning of good health and wellness. some have even become resigned to the “fact” that they can never be healthy and should just “accept” being overweight and tired. 🙁 people have become sanctimonious about their own beliefs about nutrition. we all have that facebook warrior friend droning on and on about diet x and how amazing it is, blindly following every word preached and ignoring any counter-evidence or ideas opposed to their viewpoint. there are so many unhealthy “healthy” recipes out there to make you feel better about yourself for eating crap food. vegan chocolate chip cookies. paleo ice cream. atkins pumpkin pies… these things are really just confusing people more than they are helping. people are, in general, just confused about how to lose weight, yet there is more information out there than ever before. as we delved further into the rabbit hole of health and wellness, we learned a few things that became the principles of this website: principle 1: we believe that your diet determines most of your health and well-being. when most people have a medical issue like dry skin, they usually turn to a moisturizer to solve the problem. while moisturizers are great, this is still the wrong “pill fix” mentality. the right question one should ask is “why do i have dry skin?” maybe your skin is dry because you are drinking virtually 0 cups of water a day! 🙂 did you ever think that maybe those persistent headaches you get are not just random, but actually caused by a food intolerance? these are just some of the many examples why… food is medicine. now, food can’t cure everything, but you’d be damn surprised by how many “problems” people currently have and how their diet affects (and sometimes causes) them. your health, wellness, and beauty should not be a never-ending cycle of putting on bandages to cover things up. if you eat healthy on the inside, you will radiate on the outside. principle 2. we believe in quality over quantity. counting calories is mundane, boring, and most people are terrible at it. we’re not big fans. when you focus on eating lots of high-quality nutritious foods, getting in under your calories becomes almost automatic. it’s not just about the calories, it’s what each of those calories is doing for you! principle 3. we believe that there is no one-size-fits-all diet. what you eat should be determined by your individual goals, tolerances, and intolerances. some people have celiac disease and cannot process gluten, and some people can. having a one-size “cure-all” diet does not make any sense. how you eat should also depend on your individual goals. the optimal diet for weight loss is different than the optimal diet for skin health. the optimal diet for muscle gain is different for both of those. what you eat should be determined by your goals as much as your individual needs and problems. avocadu exists to help teach others that… being healthy starts from the inside out. on september 25, 2015, we registered the domain name avocadu.com and had no idea what it would become. we have since grown to over 500,000+ monthly readers, and now have thousands of women taking our 21-day fat fat loss challenge to help them shed weight fast and look and feel better. we developed our challenge to help our clients shed weight fast because we know that the motivation from losing weight quickly is what will help motivate you to stick with your diet until you reach your goal weight. our fat loss challenge will help you lose 10-21 pounds in just 21 days, but it can also be repeated in multiple rounds if you have more weight to lose (at no extra cost!). here are some of the results our clients have had on our challenge that have been shared in our private support group: meet lissa! lissa has lost over 60 pounds in just 6 months with our program! meet megan! she is now working on her fifth round of the challenge and still working towards her goal weight! meet amber! amber has lost 62 pounds and reached her goal weight with our program! perhaps the best part of the program is that you’ll get access to a private support group where thousands of other women are going through the challenge together and sharing daily motivation, encouragement, tips, and lots of recipes! many of them are just beginning their first challenge and many are veterans that have lost tons of weight already and are there to provide you with support and encouragement along the way! click here to get started with your 21-day fat loss challenge journey today! this post may contain affiliate links. please read our disclosure for more info. copyright © 2020 · disclaimer · privacy policy · comment policy · terms & conditions · contact · the new grind llc dba avocadu.com is a participant in the amazon services llc associates program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com.
