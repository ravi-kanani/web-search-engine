i grew up in northern virginia, the oldest of three daughters. my parents added onto our home three times during my childhood. during renovations, my mom and dad let me swing hammers and “help” them build. they instilled in me a belief that i could do anything a boy could do — if not better. fifteen years ago my husband and i bought our first house in raleigh, nc and i learned how to fix things — one broken toilet at a time. in 2003, a leaky pipe turned into a major kitchen renovation. we fired the contractors and i took over the task of building back our kitchen from bare studs by myself. over the years i’ve amassed quite a few power tools. i enjoy the surprised look on faces when i explain that they are actually my power tools and i don’t usually let my husband (affectionately referred to as pretty handsome guy) touch them. want to know more about me? read this post filled with oodles of mundane facts about the girl behind the blog. a wish to empower my mantra is that if someone can do it, then there is a 95% chance that i can do it too! join me as i show you some of the accomplishments and pitfalls of doing it yourself! i love to hear from my readers i enjoy answering questions, comments or getting feedback! i love getting random sweet notes in my inbox letting me know if i’ve encouraged you. please, feel free to email me at: prettyhandygirl (at) gmail.com *remove the (at) and replace it with the @ symbol. brand awareness campaigns i do not accept payment for links. i do not accept guest posts. i won’t put your link on my blog for free. are you still reading?

they are the color, some where in between yellowish, not quite gold tone.. help reply chelsea lipford wolf says may 9, 2016 at 3:31 pm i have been following along with your blog and social for about a year now and i’m just now reading your “about” page. i, too, am the oldest of 3 daughters. my father was a remodeling contractor while i was growing up, so i learned a lot about home improving through osmosis and being around his job sites. i can also relate to having ‘my’ tools that my husband can’t touch! thanks for all you do to break down female stereotypes! i’m doing my best to do the same! reply brittany bailey says may 11, 2016 at 9:34 pm chelsea, thank you so much for your comment! us handy gals need to stick together. by the way, i already know you virtually as well and am a fan of your’s and your dad’s. let me know if you’re ever in north carolina ;-). reply chelsea lipford wolf says may 19, 2016 at 1:41 pm and vice versa if you’re ever in alabama or the gulf coast! brittany bailey says may 20, 2016 at 9:56 am will do! mindy says august 10, 2016 at 10:35 am wow brittany! i must say i’m envious! you are so very lucky to have such a skill set & that your parents took the time to get you started at a young age. of course girls can do these things, but it’s the “where do you learn” part that gets me. my dad & i always did yard projects together until he died when i was 15 and after that i didn’t have anyone to guide me. i thought changing out light fixtures and landscaping myself was pretty good. i’m going to check out the rest of your blog-can’t wait to see your projects. go girl! 😀 reply barbara o'hara says september 5, 2017 at 11:03 pm dear britanny, just found your website. thank you so much for being here. at age 70, i realize that my hubby can’t or won’t fix the little things that he used to do, so i need to do what i can for myself. the sink stopper in bathroom sink is broken and it’s driving me crazy. if i can get the elbow grease, i think i can do it. just hoping my shoulder replacement will work. thanks for the inspiration. barbara reply brittany bailey says september 6, 2017 at 10:47 am barbara, welcome, so nice to meet you. i hope your shoulder behaves. best of luck on your sink repair! reply amanda says september 11, 2017 at 3:29 pm howdy, brittany!! just found your site…don’t know why it has taken me this long. my husband and i work together on our projects (most of the time 😉 ) and he has recently joined pinterest and finds things for us to make! we usually share our tools, but if a blade is dull or something is missing, i end up getting the blame. that’s okay though, because it is the same when it comes to my sewing machines. lol on that note, why is your brand/type of sewing machine not listed under “my toolbox”? i am curious as to what type of machine you use for your projects. can’t wait to have more time to look into your site. love from texas, amanda reply brittany bailey says september 13, 2017 at 10:31 pm that’s a big oversight! i should list it in my tools. i have a brother sewing machine. this is the one i have and i’ve used it for years and it’s still in great shape. http://amzn.to/2fkaglk (affiliate link) reply jeannie wallace says july 19, 2018 at 1:53 am so glad i found you. i’m a woman of the same beliefs. i have lost both legs now and they’re above the knee so the challenge is to still be that woman without them. feel like you will inspire me quite a bit. keep up the great work. reply brittany bailey says july 19, 2018 at 9:35 pm nice to virtually meet you jeannie. i hope you find some diy projects you can tackle. sounds like you won’t let anything hold you back. reply maddie says september 28, 2018 at 2:46 am i am so happy to have found this page! we just moved into a hundred year old home in february and i’ve never felt more empowered and alive learning how to do it myself, from installing flooring to fixing drywall and teaching my daughter how to be handy too. your inspiring!,,, reply brittany bailey says october 3, 2018 at 6:28 pm welcome maddie and good luck with your 100 year old house! i bet she’ll be beautiful when finished! reply susan coleman says october 4, 2018 at 12:34 pm i can’t find where to subscribe to your email blog. thanks, susan reply brittany bailey says october 7, 2018 at 2:47 pm susan, if you are on desktop, there should be a widget on the sidebar to sign up for the newsletter and get the free e-book. let me know if you don’t find it. reply jeanne says december 7, 2018 at 12:15 am hi brittany! fellow do it myself gal here! i just started a blog focused on inspiring women to do it themselves also. i look forward to reading about your home improvement projects. i have signed up for your email list. jeanne reply maribel bellendir says february 25, 2019 at 4:23 am hi brittany. i found you on instagram. you’re very inspiring. there is so much i want to do to my house but i’m afraid of messing up. i have no support and i’m hoping to get that from you. thank you. reply felicia c. holder says june 22, 2019 at 4:42 pm hey brittany! it’s very nice to ’virtually’ meet you! 😊 i found your blog while searching for ”scrap wood diy projects” for some inspiration while on pinterest. it was doubly exciting to find out that you’re also in north carolina!!😎 my husband and i and all of our family, are born & raised north carolinians. my momma is from raleigh. she grew up in caraleigh, right between south saunders & wilmington st. my daddy’s family & my husband’s family are all from lillington. my parents met & married & settled down in garner, so that’s where i grew up. my husband & i live outside of lillington, smack dab between fort bragg & sanford. i can’t wait to see more of your projects. so far, everything i’ve seen is beautiful!! and, i apologize for my rambling. it’s just, i really enjoy talking with people and between being a sahm & living wayyyy out in the boondocks, i tend to ramble on when i do happen upon an ear, lol. anyway… i reckon i’d better get on back to the project search, now that our 2nd child has now graduated and the ”baby” starting 10th grade, i’m gonna need lots & lots of projects! haha reply brittany bailey says july 15, 2019 at 10:43 pm nice to meet you too felicia! hopefully we’ll meet in person one day! reply read more comments: « 1 2 3 4 leave a reply cancel reply this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed. hi, i'm brittany aka pretty handy girl. i like the smell of coffee and sawdust in the morning. i live to break stereotypes and empower you to take on your own diy project. email facebook instagram pinterest twitter youtube subscribe to our mailing list email facebook google+ instagram pinterest twitter privacy policy affiliate link disclosure: pretty handy girl is a participant in the amazon services llc associates program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com. copyrighted content permission all images and tutorials on this blog are copyrighted material. please contact me if you would like to borrow any media (photos, video or audio files), tutorials, or ideas from this blog. 99% of the time i would be happy to allow you to use one photo with appropriate credit and link back to prettyhandygirl.com (preferably to the same post it was borrowed from.) i can be contacted via email: prettyhandygirl (at) gmail.com. © 2020 · pretty handy girl · we use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website. if you continue to use this site we will assume that you are happy with it.ok
