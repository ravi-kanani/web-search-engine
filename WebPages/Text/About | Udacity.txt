thrun and peter norvig elected to offer their "introduction to artificial intelligence" course online to anyone, for free. over 160,000 students in more than 190 countries enrolled. the potential to educate at a global scale was awe-inspiring, and udacity was founded to pursue a mission to democratize education. it would take several years of intensive iteration and experimentation to clarify our focus on career advancement through mastery of in-demand skills, but today, udacity proudly offers aspiring learners across the globe the opportunity to participate in—and contribute to—some of the most exciting and innovative fields in the world. our corporate customers our corporate customers look to udacity to equip their employees with vital skills in data science, machine learning,
