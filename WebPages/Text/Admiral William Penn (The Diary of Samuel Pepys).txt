of arms of william penn macroom castle gatehouse in the first english civil war of 1642–1646, he fought on the side of the parliament, and commanded a ship in the squadron maintained against the king in the irish seas. the service was arduous and called for both energy and good seamanship. in 1648, he was arrested and sent to london, but was soon released, and sent back as rear-admiral in the assurance. the exact cause of the arrest remains unknown, but it may be presumed that he came under suspicion of corresponding with the king's supporters. it is highly probable that he did so, for until the restoration of 1660, he was regularly in communication with the royalists, while serving the parliament, or cromwell, so long as their service was profitable, and making no scruple of applying for grants of the confiscated lands of the king's irish friends.[2] after 1650, penn served as commander-in-chief of the southern fleet in the atlantic and in the mediterranean in pursuit of the royalists under prince rupert. after an action at macroom in county cork, ireland he was awarded macroom castle. he was so active on this service that when he returned home on 18 march 1651 he could boast that he had not put foot on shore for more than a year.[2] in the first anglo-dutch war (1652–1654), he served in the navy of the commonwealth of england, commanding squadrons at the battles of the kentish knock (1652), portland, the gabbard and scheveningen (1653). in this last battle, a sniper from his ship killed dutch admiral and fleetcommander maarten tromp on the dutch flagship brederode. in 1654, he offered to carry the fleet over to the king, but in october of the same year he had no scruple in accepting the naval command in the expedition to the west indies sent out by cromwell.[2] in 1655, he commanded the fleet that launched a bungled attack on la hispaniola. he was not responsible for the shameful repulse at san domingo, which was due to a panic among the troops.[2] afterwards, english forces seized the less desirable island of jamaica for the commonwealth régime, and penn established the jamaica station there.[3] on their return, he and his military colleague, robert venables, were sent to the tower. he made humble submission, and when released retired to the estates of confiscated land he had received in ireland.[2] on 20 december 1658, penn was knighted by henry cromwell at dublin castle, but the protectorate honour passed into oblivion at the restoration in may 1660.[4][5] political career in april 1660, penn was elected as one of the members of parliament for weymouth and melcombe regis and sat in the convention parliament.[4] he played a small part in the restoration:[2] in may 1660 he was on the earl of sandwich's ship, the naseby (later the royal charles), which was sent to bring king charles ii home to england from his exile at amsterdam in the dutch republic. during the voyage, penn made himself known to the duke of york, who was soon to be appointed lord high admiral, and with whom he had a lasting influence.[6] in 1661, penn was re-elected as a member for weymouth and melcombe regis in the cavalier parliament. in the second anglo-dutch war, he was flag captain at the battle of lowestoft (1665), serving under james, duke of york, and later in the same year was admiral of one of the fleets sent to intercept ruyter. although penn was not a high-minded man, he is a figure of considerable importance in english naval history. as admiral and general at sea for parliament, he helped in 1653 to draw up the first code of tactics provided for the english navy. it became the basis of the "duke of york's sailing and fighting instructions", which continued for long to supply the orthodox tactical creed of the navy.[2] penn was an early proponent of fighting in line ahead, so as to bring as much firepower as possible to bear.[7] legacy sir william penn's memorial in the church of st mary redcliffe, bristol a key source for the adult life of penn is the diary of his next door neighbour samuel pepys. in 1660, penn was appointed a commissioner of the navy board where he worked with pepys, clerk of the acts to the navy board. the character of "mean fellow", or "false knave",[8] given him by pepys is borne out by much that is otherwise known of him. but it is no less certain that he was an excellent seaman and a good fighter.[2] like pepys and the earl of sandwich (pepys' patron at the navy board) penn was a "moderate" roundhead who had succeeded in maintaining his position at the restoration. unsurprisingly, penn appears several times in pepys diary. a typical entry (5 april 1666) reads "to the office, where the falsenesse and impertinencies of sir w. pen would make a man mad to think of." but he is referenced perhaps most vividly in an entry for 1665, which states: "at night home and up to the leads [roof], were contrary to expectation driven down again with a stinke by sir w. pen's shying of a shitten pot in their house of office". on the other hand, the diary entry for 4 july 1666 contains a long account of penn's analysis of what was to be learnt from the four days' battle, ending with the statement: "he did talk very rationally to me, insomuch that i took more pleasure this night in hearing him discourse then i ever did in my life in anything that he said." as a native of the west country, sir william penn is buried in the church of st mary redcliffe in bristol. his helm and half-armour are hung on the wall, together with the tattered banners of dutch ships that he captured in battle. his portrait by lely, part of the flagmen of lowestoft series, is in the painted hall at greenwich. after his death, his son, william, accepted the grant of land in the american colonies in lieu of money owed by the crown to his father. william penn had wanted to call the land 'new wales', which was objected to by the secretary of state, privy council member and welshman leoline jenkins. penn instead put forward the name "sylvania". the council then chose to tweak this new name a bit by adding the prefix “penn” to honour the late admiral, william penn’s father. after some protestation from william penn, he reluctantly accepted it.[9] personal life william penn [jr] at 22 in 1666 on 6 june 1643, he married margaret jasper, a daughter of john jasper, a wealthy dutch merchant from rotterdam. they had three children: william penn (1644–1718), who married gulielma maria springett (1644–1696), and later, hannah margaret callowhill (1671–1726)

the sea from an early age. penn was (with batten, to whom he had once been apprenticed) the most experienced seaman among pepys's colleagues....he accepted a knighthood from henry cromwell in 1658. in the following year he went to england hoping for a naval appointment from the rump. monck gave him charge of the preparation of the fleet which sailed to bring home the king from exile. he was on board sandwich's ship, and soon had made himself known to the duke of york. probably at the duke's request he presented a memorandum in june 1660 to the king about the government of the navy, which shows a considerable knowledge of administrative detail. in it he expounded the advantages of government in the commonwealth manner by commissioners acting collectively and without rigidly defined duties. the reconstituted navy board set up shortly afterwards showed several traces of this advice and he was himself made a commissioner. at about the same time he drew up for the duke a new version of the admiral's instructions, issued later, in jan. 1662. pepys, who probably resented penn's superior knowledge and his intimacy with the duke, has hardly a good word to say for him either as a colleague or as a person.... ✹ nix on 2 may 2005 • link the penn/pepys relationship -- from the article on penn in the oxford dictionary of national biography: "penn came into residence at the navy office in seething lane on 27 july 1660, thus becoming a neighbour of his junior colleague pepys, in whose diary the last phases of penn's career are sharply described. pepys, although welcoming penn as ‘very sociable … and an able man’ (pepys, diary, 1.241) soon fell out with him over contracts and appointments, and above all because he saw him as enemy to his own patron sandwich. penn was ever thereafter ‘as false a fellow as ever was born’ (ibid., 7.68) and pepys took every opportunity to denigrate penn's social address, service career, and administrative probity and competence." ✹

a taste of tower of london's hospitality suite, venables appears to have been a disaster of the first order the epitomy of ineptness, and penn received some of the backlash. s. pepys may not understand some of pens comments on fellow titled leftovers from the cromwell period. the story of how 2000 plus soldiers failed to capture santa domingo, defended by a few undernourished islanders, is a good study of a combined ops. penns attitude, after this discovery of this classic in generalship and the rewards, i can be empathic with sir wm.. ✹ terry f on 27 oct 2005 • link another take on "admiral sir william penn(b.1621 - d.1670) "penn was born, married and buried in bristol. he was cromwell's sea general who was responsible, with general venables, for the british capture of jamaica in 1655. jamaica became the base for british slavery and piracy and for british colonial expansion in the west (see port royal). admiral penn had also been rewarded for his services in ireland to the cromwellian commonwealth with a castle and a confiscated estate in ireland (1656, macroom castle). an interesting fact, which speaks of the continual duplicity of the penn family, is that the coat of arms which appears with his battle armour at st mary redcliffe church, bristol is a fraud. the admiral and the penn family were not entitled to use the coat of arms which belonged to the penns of penn in buckinghamshire. the admiral and his family merely appropriated the coat of arms just as they had appropriated their irish estate and african slaves for themselves and the isle of jamaica for england. william penn, the admiral's son, was to take this appropriation further with his proprietorship of pennsylvania." http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~rstephen/livingeaston/… ✹ jeannine on 24 nov 2005

and experience can give a man of a very moderate capacity. he was well qualified to act an under part, in executing, with alacrity and vigour, what had been planned by his superiors in command. he was vice-admiral, under monck and dean, in the famous sea-fight with the dutch that continued three days, and in which the gallant tromp was defeated. he was, without declaration of war, sent to take st. domingo from the spaniards. the design was well laid by cromwell, and would have been executed with great facility by a blake; but it exceeded the capacity of pen. in this expedition he took jamaica, a colony which cost a great deal of blood and treasure; but which, in process of time, proved advantageous to the nation. he was father of a much greater man than himself, who is well known among the quakers as a preacher and a writer; and throughout the world as the founder and legislator of the colony of pensylvania. ---a biographical history of england. j. granger, 1779. ✹ bill on 16 nov 2014 •
