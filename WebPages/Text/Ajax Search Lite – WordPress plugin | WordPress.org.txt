 screenshots ajax search lite in action - 2 themes administrator area - nice and smooth installation upload ajax-search-lite to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory activate the plugin through the ‘plugins’ menu in wordpress place the shortcode from the settings into your template or post-page faq after an update, the plugin stopped working or the layout is broken it is most likely a cache related issue. make sure to clear all website cache, including page, minify, browser and cdn as well. after that, refresh your browser window by hitting ctrl + shift + r buttons (cmd + shift + r on mac) a few times. the images are not showing, what is wrong? the search parses the first image from the post/page content. most likely there is no image in post. when i type in something, the search wheel is spinning, but nothing happens it is most likely, that another plugin or the template is throwing errors while the ajax request is generated. disabling all the plugins one by one can help you rule out which plugin is creating the issue. i disabled all the plugins but the search wheel is still spinning to infinity, nothing happens you should contact me on the support forum with your website url. i will check your website and will let you know what to do. reviews me encanta izquierdocreativo february 27, 2020 me encanta este plugin, me ha resuelto la búsqueda de varias de mis webs. fácil de configurar y bastante rápido. thank you kerem january 26, 2020 it's very easy and decent. but it lacks adding different forms, hope it comes in future updates. thanks for this plugin! great richard january 21, 2020 took me ages finding a search engine, that will find everything in every page -despite a different theme set up. very simple, but does exactly what i needed, thank you great flizzywp january 15, 2020 works like a charm and the premium support is top-notch. very powerful search plugin zpaparidis october 4, 2019 i have been using the lite version of the plugin for more than two years now and i was more than satisfied with what it is offering. upgrading to pro for my most recent project was a one way street as different search bars for different custom post types were required. the joy i had that in addition i could create a nice filterable isotope styled section with search results (something like we do for filterable portfolio items) was of course great. there are tons of options and most likely whatever you need to modify, you can find it somewhere in the options. it takes its time with try and error but in the end the result is more than satisfactory. highly recommended!!! very nice plugin mrkoetje july 1, 2019 i was searching and searching for a searching plugin but no searching anymore because searchers can really search well with this search plugin 😉 serious, its great! everything you can imagine. i use it with wp 5.2.2 / genesis 3.0.1 and beaver builder read all 128 reviews contributors & developers “ajax search lite” is open source
