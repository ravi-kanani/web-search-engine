studies show that women start to have alcohol-related problems sooner and at lower drinking levels than men and for multiple reasons.3 on average, women weigh less than men. also, alcohol resides predominantly in body water, and pound for pound, women have less water in their bodies than men. this means that after a woman and a man of the same weight drink the same amount of alcohol, the woman’s blood alcohol concentration (bac, the amount of alcohol in the blood) will tend to be higher, putting her at greater risk for harm. other biological differences may contribute as well. looking for a realistic way of losing weight fast?
