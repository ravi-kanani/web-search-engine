real-time flight updates – simply plug in your flight and you’ll have immediate access (and live updates) regarding gate changes, delays, and any departure information. this will save you both time and stress on travel days. finding nearby medical facilities – should any accident occur in a foreign country, you will need to know where to go, or who to call for an emergency situation. the app contains phone numbers for all police, ambulance and fire departments all over the world. the app’s hospital search enables you to find reliable facilities as well. i hope you make the right move to get allianz travel insurance for your upcoming trips and use the travel smart app. you can download it for free on the app store or google play. disclaimer: i work with allianz and receive financial compensation from them. that being said, this post was written by me and all opinions are mine. about latest posts drew binsky a graduate from the university of wisconsin-madison, drew binsky has visited 190+ countries since 2012.he first caught the travel bug while studying abroad in prague, then taught english in korea, and now he's on a mission to visit every country on earth.follow his journey on youtube & instagram @drewbinsky 🙂 latest posts by drew binsky (see all) my 2018 recap: 35 new countries visited - january 3, 2019 iran is not what you think!!
