okay, that‚Äôs okay. i don‚Äôt know if i can change your mind. those opinions run deep. but also‚Ä¶ maybe i can. if any recipe can, it might be this one. these mushrooms are smokey, sweet, and salty all at once. when they are marinated and roasted, they turn into these caramelized golden crispy-and-juicy little nibblers, and i swear i could eat an entire 8-ounce package of them. here they are pre-roasting, soaking up all that glorious sauce: so naturally, let‚Äôs build some bowls with them, right? roasty mushroom nibblers (can we just call them that now?), caramelized pineapple, peppers, and a dollop of kale pesto over some rice or cauliflower rice or honestly over nothing at all. this combination is fresh and springy and giving me life. if i can throw one other idea your way, it would be this: tempeh. here it is, also marinating in the same sauce, about to be roasted the same way as the mushrooms. if you don‚Äôt like mushrooms, this is your backup plan! when i made this in our studio kitchen this week, we all just stood around the fresh-out-the-oven pan and snacked on roasted mushrooms and tempeh. what is life right now, really. these mushrooms are amazing. check out our video for how to make mushroom bowls: smoky mushroom bowls with kale pesto ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 5 from 4 reviews author: lindsay prep time: 20 minutes cook time: 30 minutes total time: 50 minutes yield: 4 1x print recipe pin recipe description amazing mushroom bowls with kale pesto! smoky, sweet, salt mushrooms (or tempeh!), caramelized pineapple, peppers, and dollop of kale pesto, all served over rice. so good. scale 1x2x3x ingredients smoky-sweet marinade 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup maple syrup 1/4 cup soy sauce 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/2 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder salt and black pepper (to taste) bowls 16 ounces fresh mushrooms, washed and cut into thick-ish slices 2 cups fresh pineapple chunks 2‚Äì3 bell peppers rice or cauliflower rice kale pesto, magic green sauce, or any other yummy sauce video instructions whisk or shake the marinate in a jar until combined. place mushrooms in a shallow bowl. cover with enough marinade to get some flavor on each of the mushroom pieces (you might have some marinade left ‚Äì that‚Äôs okay, you can use it later in this recipe, or save for next week‚Äôs bowls). preheat oven to 450 degrees. let the mushrooms rest for 20-30 minutes while you prep other ingredients, including your sauce! place peppers, pineapple, and mushrooms with marinade each on their own sheet pans. bake for 20-or-so minutes, rotating pans as needed, until you get some nice browning on everything (peppers will roast a few minutes faster). you can use the broiler to help with the browning as needed. serve in a bowl over rice or cauli rice. top with your sauce (yeah kale pesto)! you can also put all this yumminess in a wrap or on a salad. poof! look at healthy, delicious you. notes tips for roasting: don‚Äôt overcrowd the pans because the pineapple, peppers, and mushrooms might start to steam instead of roast / caramelize / brown. i would recommend draining off excess juice from your pineapple if it seems to have a lot of moisture. if your mushrooms look like they have a lot of liquid, that‚Äôs okay ‚Äì keep roasting a bit longer and the sauce will kind of turn into a gooey crust and the mushrooms will get even deeper in color and flavor. yum. alternative to mushrooms: tempeh is also really delicious here. if you use tempeh, let it marinate for at least 2-3 hours if possible because it takes a bit longer to absorb the flavor. you can pan-fry it or roast it in the same way as directed for the mushrooms. category: dinner method: bake cuisine: american keywords: mushroom bowls, mushroom recipe, vegan recipe, vegetarian recipe, kale pesto did you make this recipe?
