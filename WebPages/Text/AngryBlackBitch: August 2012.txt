practicing the fine art of bitchitude monday, august 20, 2012 congressman todd akin has opinions… ***trigger warning*** let’s jump in, shall we? over the weekend missouri congressman and candidate for senate, todd akin, indulged in another rancid moment of sharing. akin would like to spin it as a verbal malfunction, but…well, he meant what he said he just regrets saying it…and saying something you later regret is extremely different from saying something that inspires bipartisan condemnation because it is inaccurate, medically impossible, and insulting to rape survivors. and the choir asked… “what did that fool say this time?” and a bitch replied… akin was discussing abortion with reporter charles jaco when he said… “if it’s legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” pause…collect thyself…continue. akin’s statement inspires so many questions. how does he define “legitimate rape”? does a survivor have to be roughed up…would bruises be helpful? is he a phyllis schlafly-ite on the subject…does he agree with her that a married woman can’t be raped? how exactly does the female body expel a pregnancy resulting from rape? is this a spontaneous act or something triggered after a successful conviction? i’m dying to hear the answers. ugh. this, my friends, is a public example of what missouri reproductive justice activists encounter often from folks opposed to women having access to the full range of reproductive health care including abortion. inaccuracy. medically impossible information they then swear they got from a doctor. and regular insults followed by callous disregard. akin didn’t misspeak. he just said in public what these conservative fiends say behind closed doors after refusing to allow a vote on legislation that would establish a consistent standard of care in emergency rooms that includes information about emergency contraception. so don’t give akin’s presidential wanna-be buddies a pass cause they rebuke his statement. until the gop condemns the policy behind his statement…policies that attempt to block access to emergency contraception…they might as well add an akin seminar on “legitimate rape” to the gop convention agenda and own that disgusting shit. posted by shark-fu at 7:50 am 13 comments: monday, august 13, 2012 baked flounder with a side of braunschweiger… mitt romney has selected a certain congressman paul ryan of wisconsin as his running mate. ***rubs hands together*** oooh…this is gonna be fun! shall we? paul motherfucking ryan!!! i’ve got a very special level of resentment for mr. ryan…since he’s the architect of a budget that would slash social service programs many disabled folk, like my brother bill, rely on to live. oh, no one can deny that ryan has an appeal...but i, for one, am thrilled by it. what? think about it. ryan is a tea party dahling…and what comes with rallying the tea party base? you got it – tea partiers! their collective orgasm will produce a rather motley crew of supporters…and those supporters will go a long way to helping team obama make the case that romney-ryan is an unhealthy meal for the masses. this election is now clearly going to be about choices. and that’s the best kind of election, in my humble opinion. let the games begin… ...and may the masses vote like their medicare depends on it! posted by shark-fu at 7:39 am 7 comments: monday, august 06, 2012 vote like your rights depend on it… longtime readers know that this bitch adores voting. i unfortunately didn’t have time to teach voter education classes this cycle (sob), but i find comfort in knowing that there are tons of first time voters who will head to the polls for tomorrow’s missouri primary. go forth and vote like your rights depend on it, y’all! cause they do…they really, really do. every year brings at least one example of why elections matter. in missouri we need only look at the 2010 state senate race for district 24 when barbara fraser faced john lamping. the outgoing state senator joan bray had been an outstanding champion for progressive causes including women’s reproductive health care. a lot was at stake. in 2010 the st. louis post-dispatch painted republican candidate lamping as a moderate…even hinting that he would break with his party on key abortion votes. heck, even missouri right to life opted not to endorse…that had to mean something, right. wrong. senator lamping won that race in 2010. in 2012 he wrote the highly controversial birth control refusal bill sb749…a bill that would allow any employer to refuse coverage of birth control in insurance plan simply because they profess that coverage violates the employers moral blah, blah, blah. sb749 passed with ease. lamping emerged as the anti-choice darling…his picture adorning religious email blasts, his presence coveted at rallies in support of opposing birth control. the same st. louis post-dispatch that painted lamping as something other than a typical lockstep missouri republican came out in opposition of his birth control refusal bill. governor nixon vetoed the birth control refusal bill and the fate of that veto is now in the hands of the september veto session. elections matter. the ballot is no place to roll the dice, close your eyes, and take a chance. vote like your rights depend on it. they do. i hope to see you at the polls tomorrow august 7! posted by shark-fu at 7:46 am no comments: again… a gunman opened fire and killed at least six people sunday inside a sikh temple in suburban milwaukee. even as my heart hurts for the victims and survivors, i can’t help noting that we’ve gotten freakishly good at this…the media at coverage, communities at gathering for memorials to mourn, and the masses at making excuses and then moving on. another mass shooting…another violent act of hate…and reports of six people murdered by a gunman. the gunman was also shot and killed. there’s a damn formula that unfolds. the attack…calls to police…a massive show of force…and end to the violence…and then the media reports…followed by public displays of mourning and perhaps flowers and candles deposited near the murder site. then the excuses…the debates and defense and dismissive statements. yeah, we’ve got this down now. and that says a lot… …doesn’t it?

that doesn’t make sense within the anti-gay vengeful god rhetoric cathy spouts. either chick-fil-a is full of shit or their family-run private bitness worships the god of money more than they fear god’s wrath. mayhap they are a crispy fried combo of both?
