practicing the fine art of bitchitude wednesday, august 28, 2013 ain’t gonna let nobody turn me around! shall we? i haven’t been blogging. i took an extended break, because i needed to work through a serious case of doubt. yep…doubt. i doubted my ability to make an impact. i doubted the inherent decency of my fellow humans. and let me tell you, doubt like that will stall progress and i mean stall it good! i didn’t want to pass this doubt along to others, so i stopped. stopped tuning in…ceased blogging…and stood still. when in doubt, particularly when that doubt is about my social justice work, i turn toward history. yep…history. history shows us that experiencing doubt is normal… …and that succumbing to doubt is exactly what the man wants. i’ve been diving deep into movement history to treat my doubt. the amazing thing about the activists who made the civil rights movement happen is that they acted through the doubt…they marched in spite of the unknown…and they participated in demonstrations when threats were real, fear was valid, and those who were sworn to protect were preparing to do damage. suffice it to say, the eyes on the prize treatment plan has done wonders! today, on the 50th anniversary of the march on washington for jobs and freedom, i’m recommitting to the cause. and i ain’t gonna let no body turn me around. bitchitude is back. posted by shark-fu at 7:42 am 22 comments: newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) about me shark-fu view my complete profile followers blog archive ► 2019 (1) ► march (1) ► 2018 (4) ► october (1) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► 2017 (11) ► december (2) ► november (3) ► october (2) ► april (1) ► march (1) ► february (2) ► 2016 (5) ► june (4) ► january (1) ► 2015 (6) ► september (1) ► august (1) ► july (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ► 2014 (6) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ▼ 2013 (24) ► october (2) ► september (2) ▼ august (1) ain’t gonna let nobody turn me around! ► july (2) ► june (4) ► may (1) ► april (3) ► february (5) ► january (4) ► 2012 (98) ► december (3) ► november (5) ► october (9) ► september (12) ► august (6) ► july (2) ► june (5) ► may (9) ► april (6) ► march (16) ► february (14) ► january (11) ► 2011 (167) ► december (7) ► november (12) ► october (13) ► september (9) ► august (19) ► july (14) ► june (15) ► may (14) ► april (15) ► march (14) ► february (19) ► january (16) ► 2010 (260) ► december (18) ► november (20) ► october (20) ► september (19) ► august (25) ► july (20) ► june (32) ► may (22) ► april (21) ► march (22) ► february (17) ► january (24) ► 2009 (259) ► december (19) ► november (21) ► october (19) ► september (18) ► august (25) ► july (26) ► june (23) ► may (20) ► april (25) ► march (16) ► february (22) ► january (25) ► 2008 (340) ► december (21) ► november (18) ► october (23) ► september (19) ► august (38) ► july (29) ► june (33) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (31) ► february (31) ► january (36) ► 2007 (404) ► december (29) ► november (45) ► october (43) ► september (37) ► august (38) ► july (31) ► june (29) ► may (30) ► april (30) ► march (30) ► february (30) ► january (32) ► 2006 (400) ► december (32) ► november (36) ► october (33) ► september (30) ► august (29) ► july (32) ► june (35) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (37) ► february (37) ► january (38) ► 2005 (319) ► december (44) ► november (36) ► october (27) ► september (32) ► august (27) ► july (32) ► june (30) ► may (29) ► april (24) ► march (25) ► february (13) awesome inc. theme. powered by blogger.
