practicing the fine art of bitchitude wednesday, december 19, 2012 after the teddy bear memorials are taken down… i’ve spent the past few days trying to process the massacre that happened at sandy hook elementary in newtown ct. i’m still working on that. there was the world before 27 people…20 of them children…were gunned down in school. it is up to all of us to work on the world after… …the world left behind after the teddy bear memorials are taken down. posted by shark-fu at 7:53 am 6 comments: thursday, december 13, 2012 through whatever, come what may… shall we? confession: the past several months have been…challenging. longtime readers know that my older brother is autistic and that i’m co-guardian along with my sister. well, my brother has had a rough couple of months. i can’t get into the details. the specifics don’t apply. suffice it to say he’s frustrated and letting the whole world know. and i’m a mess. because i can’t cast rainbows across the sky. i can’t fix it with a snap of my fingers. even though i know that this isn’t my fault…that he’s his own person dealing with his own shit and the whole world doesn’t revolve around me…even though i know that shit, i can’t stop questioning each and every decision i’ve made and what role it may or may not have…ugh. i get that a good day won’t guarantee that all the days that follow are good...just like a bad day doesn’t forecast never-ending drama. fuck it. a good day with my brother is the greatest joy…and the bad days wrench my heart to pieces. so, i’m a mess. i learned long ago to let myself be a mess…to not fight it or try to put on a brave face. there’s a strange comfort from acknowledging that sometimes shit is just hard as hell with a dash of emotionally taxing, and that’s just the way of it. and i remember the not too bad days…the so-so, that wasn’t so bad days…and those gloriously fantabulous good days. through whatever. yeah, we’ll get through this. come what may. posted by shark-fu at 8:03 am 10 comments: tuesday, december 11, 2012 a look ahead to 2013... tis december in missouri and that means we’re in the season of pre-filing. yay. anyhoo, pre-filing means that state legislators are filing bills ahead of the 2013 session that will begin in january. let’s take a look, shall we? oh look, representative gatschenberger (r-108) pre-filed hb31, which seeks to prevent local government from governing locally. pause…re-read…continue. yep, this bill would prevent local government from passing ordinances dealing with how folk protest. oh, no…not just how anyone protests! the people rep. gatschenberger feels need extra special extended and enhanced protection from local ordinances, drafted by local government officials who live in the community, are those folk who protest in front of health care facilities providing access to the full range of reproductive health care including abortion services. hb31 isn’t even trying to be slick. i mean, you’ve just gotta love the description of hb31! “specifies that the constitutions and laws of the united states and missouri must protect the rights of an alternatives-to-abortion agency and its officers to freely engage in activities without interference.” freely engage in activities without interference?!? oh, that’s rich! how about “freely engage in activities, sans interference, that interfere with other people’s ability to freely engage in activities without interference.” cause you know and i know that you know and rep. gatschenberger knows that the goal of these “alternatives-to-abortion” agencies is to disrupt or better yet deny people’s ability to access health care. let’s continue. i noticed that members of the missouri senate have been busy too. just in case you didn’t know, the same gaggle of legislators who like to go on and on about the “good” done by anti-abortion groups camped outside of health care centers are also card carrying members of the we hate poor pregnant women club. behold, senator schaaf! senator schaaf pre-filed sb14, which would raise medicaid eligibility for some folks (elderly, blind, and otherwise disabled) but lower it for…wait for it…pregnant women and children. sb14’s trigger for lowering eligibility for pregnant women and children would be if tax credits are available in a federal exchange. uh huh. so, the missouri house is trying to take rights away from local government under the guise of protecting anti-abortion protesters with the hope that relentless harassment will lead to women being forced to continue their pregnancy… …so that they can then be told that their pregnant ass is no longer eligible for medicaid because the missouri senate lowered eligibility in some legislative tantrum over tax credits in the yet to be created federal health care exchange. 2013 is shaping up to be another five month revival of how not to govern financed on the people’s dime. posted by shark-fu at 9:45 am 3 comments: newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) about me shark-fu view my complete profile followers blog archive ► 2019 (1) ► march (1) ► 2018 (4) ► october (1) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► 2017 (11) ► december (2) ► november (3) ► october (2) ► april (1) ► march (1) ► february (2) ► 2016 (5) ► june (4) ► january (1) ► 2015 (6) ► september (1) ► august (1) ► july (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ► 2014 (6) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ► 2013 (24) ► october (2) ► september (2) ► august (1) ► july (2) ► june (4) ► may (1) ► april (3) ► february (5) ► january (4) ▼ 2012 (98) ▼ december (3) after the teddy bear memorials are taken down… through whatever, come what may… a look ahead to 2013... ► november (5) ► october (9) ► september (12) ► august (6) ► july (2) ► june (5) ► may (9) ► april (6) ► march (16) ► february (14) ► january (11) ► 2011 (167) ► december (7) ► november (12) ► october (13) ► september (9) ► august (19) ► july (14) ► june (15) ► may (14) ► april (15) ► march (14) ► february (19) ► january (16) ► 2010 (260) ► december (18) ► november (20) ► october (20) ► september (19) ► august (25) ► july (20) ► june (32) ► may (22) ► april (21) ► march (22) ► february (17) ► january (24) ► 2009 (259) ► december (19) ► november (21) ► october (19) ► september (18) ► august (25) ► july (26) ► june (23) ► may (20) ► april (25) ► march (16) ► february (22) ► january (25) ► 2008 (340) ► december (21) ► november (18) ► october (23) ► september (19) ► august (38) ► july (29) ► june (33) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (31) ► february (31) ► january (36) ► 2007 (404) ► december (29) ► november (45) ► october (43) ► september (37) ► august (38) ► july (31) ► june (29) ► may (30) ► april (30) ► march (30) ► february (30) ► january (32) ► 2006 (400) ► december (32) ► november (36) ► october (33) ► september (30) ► august (29) ► july (32) ► june (35) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (37) ► february (37) ► january (38) ► 2005 (319) ► december (44) ► november (36) ► october (27) ► september (32) ► august (27) ► july (32) ► june (30) ► may (29) ► april (24) ► march (25) ► february (13) awesome inc. theme. powered by blogger.
