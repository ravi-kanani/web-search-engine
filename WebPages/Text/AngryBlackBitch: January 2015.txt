practicing the fine art of bitchitude friday, january 23, 2015 give us a twirl and tell us about your outfit... confession...i’ve been enjoying the hell out of deflate-gate. what? at least espn doesn’t sound like an dateline nbc survival story anymore! and hey, deflate-gate was just about the get boring, but then tom brady held that nixonian press conference and pumped some life back into it. had a sistah popping corn, pouring a vodka cran, and getting comfortable to watch sportscenter! good stuff. anyhoo, in the midst of the mega-scandal over deflated footballs and what tom brady knew and when he stopped knowing it...emerged twirlgate! mmmhmm, some fool asked more than one woman to “twirl and tell us about your outfit” during on-court interviews at the australian open. i kid you not. others have already weighed in on the sexism and "eeeewwwww, as if!!!" factor, but my mind immediately went to how this twisted mess would play out if it were applied during this weekend’s nhl all star game. just imagine...instead of the same boring kiss-ass interviews where some former hockey player asks jonathan toews how cool it is to be totally awesome or asks steven stamkos whether it is hard to be the hockey player nbc sports announcers most want to clone...instead of that mess, the hockey talking heads could kick things off with "can you give us a twirl and tell us about your outfit?" or should it be "give us a spin"...cause of the ice? ***cough*** whatever...it would be magical. and it'd be totally worth it just for the looks of absolute horror that would greet that mess. maybe then...i mean, obviously we'd have to wait until after twitter melted down from all the "did that just happen?!?!" tweets followed by several million "did stamkos actually twirl for that dude?!?!?" re-tweets...but after all that settled down, maybe then we could have a discussion about why the hell something that is beyond comical to imagine going down at the nhl all star game happens to women in professional sports. blink. and yes, i’ll be asking everyone and their mother to give me a twirl and tell me about their outfit...at least until tom brady holds another press conference... ....or until the colts release video evidence that gov. chris christie deflated all those footballs. until then, happy nhl all star weekend!

thankfully, after i walked through that sea of blah and came out on the other side, i realized i'd re-learned one precious true thing - even as we fight, we must take care to not become what we’ve been fighting against. ***pause...sip iced green tea...continue*** anyhoo, that's why i stepped away. and yes...i'm back. posted by shark-fu at 12:58 pm 14 comments: newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) about me shark-fu view my complete profile followers blog archive ► 2019 (1) ► march (1) ► 2018 (4) ► october (1) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► 2017 (11) ► december (2) ► november (3) ► october (2) ► april (1) ► march (1) ► february (2) ► 2016 (5) ► june (4) ► january (1) ▼ 2015 (6) ► september (1) ► august (1) ► july (1) ► february (1) ▼ january (2) give us a twirl and tell us about your outfit... on why i stepped away...and why i'm back... ► 2014 (6) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ► 2013 (24) ► october (2) ► september (2) ► august (1) ► july (2) ► june (4) ► may (1) ► april (3) ► february (5) ► january (4) ► 2012 (98) ► december (3) ► november (5) ► october (9) ► september (12) ► august (6) ► july (2) ► june (5) ► may (9) ► april (6) ► march (16) ► february (14) ► january (11) ► 2011 (167) ► december (7) ► november (12) ► october (13) ► september (9) ► august (19) ► july (14) ► june (15) ► may (14) ► april (15) ► march (14) ► february (19) ► january (16) ► 2010 (260) ► december (18) ► november (20) ► october (20) ► september (19) ► august (25) ► july (20) ► june (32) ► may (22) ► april (21) ► march (22) ► february (17) ► january (24) ► 2009 (259) ► december (19) ► november (21) ► october (19) ► september (18) ► august (25) ► july (26) ► june (23) ► may (20) ► april (25) ► march (16) ► february (22) ► january (25) ► 2008 (340) ► december (21) ► november (18) ► october (23) ► september (19) ► august (38) ► july (29) ► june (33) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (31) ► february (31) ► january (36) ► 2007 (404) ► december (29) ► november (45) ► october (43) ► september (37) ► august (38) ► july (31) ► june (29) ► may (30) ► april (30) ► march (30) ► february (30) ► january (32) ► 2006 (400) ► december (32) ► november (36) ► october (33) ► september (30) ► august (29) ► july (32) ► june (35) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (37) ► february (37) ► january (38) ► 2005 (319) ► december (44) ► november (36) ► october (27) ► september (32) ► august (27) ► july (32) ► june (30) ► may (29) ► april (24) ► march (25) ► february (13) awesome inc. theme. powered by blogger.
