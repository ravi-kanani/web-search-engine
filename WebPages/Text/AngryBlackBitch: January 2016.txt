practicing the fine art of bitchitude tuesday, january 12, 2016 sotu 2016 preparedness… y’all, i’ve been missing from the internets because i’ve been hard at work getting my new gig reproaction up and running. i’m amazed at what we’ve been able to accomplish in just eight months! so exciting. now that life has settled into a more predictable rhythm, i’ve decided to dusted off my keyboard and get my bitchitude on again. shall we? tonight is president obama’s final state of the union address. time has flown! it seems like just yesterday rep. joe wilson was indulging in a public display of no-home-training by shouting nonsense, and now here we are in 2016 about to witness obama’s final sotu. amazing. i'll be watching from the comfort of my cozy living room...with some yummy snacks and beverages too. sadly, my beloved sorta-beagles have gone on to their blessed reward in dawg heaven. my new canine companion, miss zelda bear, is a large 2 year-old kuvasz-ish fluffy sweet-faced joy. this is probably zelda’s first sotu, so i plan to make it exciting for her by giving her a bone to chew. the current plan is to fry up some catfish and gather up a salad. oh, and there will be vodka cocktails too. ***rubs hands together in glee*** let the games begin! toodles. posted by shark-fu at 3:11 pm 6 comments: newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) about me shark-fu view my complete profile followers blog archive ► 2019 (1) ► march (1) ► 2018 (4) ► october (1) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► 2017 (11) ► december (2) ► november (3) ► october (2) ► april (1) ► march (1) ► february (2) ▼ 2016 (5) ► june (4) ▼ january (1) sotu 2016 preparedness… ► 2015 (6) ► september (1) ► august (1) ► july (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ► 2014 (6) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ► 2013 (24) ► october (2) ► september (2) ► august (1) ► july (2) ► june (4) ► may (1) ► april (3) ► february (5) ► january (4) ► 2012 (98) ► december (3) ► november (5) ► october (9) ► september (12) ► august (6) ► july (2) ► june (5) ► may (9) ► april (6) ► march (16) ► february (14) ► january (11) ► 2011 (167) ► december (7) ► november (12) ► october (13) ► september (9) ► august (19) ► july (14) ► june (15) ► may (14) ► april (15) ► march (14) ► february (19) ► january (16) ► 2010 (260) ► december (18) ► november (20) ► october (20) ► september (19) ► august (25) ► july (20) ► june (32) ► may (22) ► april (21) ► march (22) ► february (17) ► january (24) ► 2009 (259) ► december (19) ► november (21) ► october (19) ► september (18) ► august (25) ► july (26) ► june (23) ► may (20) ► april (25) ► march (16) ► february (22) ► january (25) ► 2008 (340) ► december (21) ► november (18) ► october (23) ► september (19) ► august (38) ► july (29) ► june (33) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (31) ► february (31) ► january (36) ► 2007 (404) ► december (29) ► november (45) ► october (43) ► september (37) ► august (38) ► july (31) ► june (29) ► may (30) ► april (30) ► march (30) ► february (30) ► january (32) ► 2006 (400) ► december (32) ► november (36) ► october (33) ► september (30) ► august (29) ► july (32) ► june (35) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (37) ► february (37) ► january (38) ► 2005 (319) ► december (44) ► november (36) ► october (27) ► september (32) ► august (27) ► july (32) ► june (30) ► may (29) ► april (24) ► march (25) ► february (13) awesome inc. theme. powered by blogger.
