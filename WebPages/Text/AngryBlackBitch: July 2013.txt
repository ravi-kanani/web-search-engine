featuring some über angry dude loading a shotgun. tis illegal to do in dc, so there’s been a lot of coverage. plus, the dude was in full rage face and that made the video both compelling and scary as hell. the rage face dude is promising an armed and loaded march on washington…oh, and he’s also preparing for the next american revolution. blink. as i listened to rage face go on and on, while standing in the same spot he filmed the video, i couldn’t help but be struck by the privilege oozing from the situation. the fact that he was able to do what he did…right out there in the open in the middle of some random afternoon…wasn’t shocking. nope, that’s life. rage face wasn’t even aware of his privilege…hell, he was probably pissed that he wasn’t getting arrested or charged up or even noticed by anyone other than the news crew filming his triumphant return to the scene of the crime. and that’s life too. so, i’ve been sitting here waiting for folks to show up for the morning session of the conference i’m attending…sitting and thinking about the privilege of anger. my mind keeps returning to the trial of george zimmerman for the murder of trayvon martin and the recent testimony of that young man’s father. returning to how both of the victim’s parents are visibly holding back so much emotion. to how trayvon’s father is so clearly in mourning…his face a mask of sorrow that makes my heart break. and i can’t help but wish they had the same right to a face of rage that millions of other americans have. i wish they could shout and scream and let it all out...over and over and over, even though it won’t make it better. rage won’t bring trayvon back. and no amount of rage face will guarantee justice. i guess that’s why the parent’s of murdered children all have that look in their eye that suggests a level of anger too volatile to set free. because they know…they’ve learned the hard way…that justice is the lie the system pitches because the truth of loss is just too much the take. pause…sip coffee…continue. which brings me back to rage face with that shotgun…and his outrage over the very thought of someone taking his gun…and the thousands upon thousands of folks who think he did a great thing because they share his outrage. his outrage that someone may take his gun. may take someone’s son. could take his gun. could take someone’s son. are thinking about taking his gun. are thinking about taking someone’s son. in a country where some can load a shotgun two blocks from the capitol without comment while others get shot for the crime of walking home after buying snacks. posted by shark-fu at 8:02 am 3 comments: newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) about me shark-fu view my complete profile followers blog archive ► 2019 (1) ► march
