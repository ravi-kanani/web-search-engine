practicing the fine art of bitchitude tuesday, may 20, 2014 what i’ve been up to… hi, y’all! i know, i know…i’m the worst. i’ve been gone forever and a day, but i’ve got a good excuse! i was working to protect regular folk from wretched policies being foisted upon my beloved missouri by über-conservatives and their in-state minions. blink. no, really. anyhoo, i’m back. shall we? shark-fu’s quick review of a few of the horrible proposals passed this session… #1 the failure to pass medicaid expansion…and why there’s a special place in hell for people who support taking a dumb ass stand… the missouri legislature failed to pass medicaid expansion…again. because…um…freedom? yep, apparently the “brave” wanna-be patriots who killed medicaid expansion this time are dedicated to defending the right to die from lack of access to health care. hundreds of people will die due to lack of access to healthcare…access that the legislature had the opportunity to extend and chose not to because they hate obama more than they love their fellow missourians. this shit would be amusing…if we weren’t two years in on a life and death situation. the fight continues... #2 tis like watching a 10-vehicle car wreck in super slow motion…all the while knowing that the very people elected to prevent shit triggered the “accident” like this… in a move that missouri will likely suffer from for years, if not decades, to come…wince…the missouri legislature passed a massive tax cut that will benefit rich folk while leaving average missourians with a devastating financial crisis. one need only look west to kansas for proof that politicians can make all kinds of promises…but tis reality that comes knocking on the door when bad proposals become law. i’m particularly concerned with the ripple effect of this mess. the immediate impact will be to schools…but pretty soon missouri’s lack of income will hit programs that my autistic brother depends on. heck, we haven’t seen an increase in snaps funding in a decade…he qualifies for several really cool programs but transportation for stuff like that hasn’t been funded for years, so… and now they’re taking more money out of an already underfunded system, and…i just can't bring myself to imagine what's left to cut. i know i'll have to soon. we've only got two years to plan for this mess, but...damn it. let's continue... #3 the same folk who sleep well having denied thousands of missourians access to heath care costing hundreds of lives in the name of less government, also decided to shove government all up in people’s lives by tripling the mandatory waiting period for abortion… i had the honor of leading the communications crew for the women’s filibuster in jefferson city last week. it was a truly amazing experience, seeing my fellow missourians stand up and speak truth to power…and we all drew strength from the support we received from all over the world. the legislature passed a bill that triples the mandatory waiting period for abortion care in missouri. so, we stood at the capitol and conducted a citizen’s filibuster for 72 hours…from monday at 2pm until thursday at 2pm. they passed the bill, but we hope governor nixon will veto it. because, freedom. stay tuned, friends! posted by shark-fu at 11:02 am 6 comments: newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) about me shark-fu view my complete profile followers blog archive ► 2019 (1) ► march (1) ► 2018 (4) ► october (1) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► 2017 (11) ► december (2) ► november (3) ► october (2) ► april (1) ► march (1) ► february (2) ► 2016 (5) ► june (4) ► january (1) ► 2015 (6) ► september (1) ► august (1) ► july (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ▼ 2014 (6) ► august (2) ▼ may (1) what i’ve been up to… ► february (1) ► january (2) ► 2013 (24) ► october (2) ► september (2) ► august (1) ► july (2) ► june (4) ► may (1) ► april (3) ► february (5) ► january (4) ► 2012 (98) ► december (3) ► november (5) ► october (9) ► september (12) ► august (6) ► july (2) ► june (5) ► may (9) ► april (6) ► march (16) ► february (14) ► january (11) ► 2011 (167) ► december (7) ► november (12) ► october (13) ► september (9) ► august (19) ► july (14) ► june (15) ► may (14) ► april (15) ► march (14) ► february (19) ► january (16) ► 2010 (260) ► december (18) ► november (20) ► october (20) ► september (19) ► august (25) ► july (20) ► june (32) ► may (22) ► april (21) ► march (22) ► february (17) ► january (24) ► 2009 (259) ► december (19) ► november (21) ► october (19) ► september (18) ► august (25) ► july (26) ► june (23) ► may (20) ► april (25) ► march (16) ► february (22) ► january (25) ► 2008 (340) ► december (21) ► november (18) ► october (23) ► september (19) ► august (38) ► july (29) ► june (33) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (31) ► february (31) ► january (36) ► 2007 (404) ► december (29) ► november (45) ► october (43) ► september (37) ► august (38) ► july (31) ► june (29) ► may (30) ► april (30) ► march (30) ► february (30) ► january (32) ► 2006 (400) ► december (32) ► november (36) ► october (33) ► september (30) ► august (29) ► july (32) ► june (35) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (37) ► february (37) ► january (38) ► 2005 (319) ► december (44) ► november (36) ► october (27) ► september (32) ► august (27) ► july (32) ► june (30) ► may (29) ► april (24) ► march (25) ► february (13) awesome inc. theme. powered by blogger.
