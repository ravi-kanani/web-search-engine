practicing the fine art of bitchitude sunday, may 06, 2018 trumpless tuesdays are so damn good ... y'all, a sistah has been busier than busy getting my resistance on! anyhoo, i'm back on the scene to share a personal ecology idea that i had while trying to avoid trump's face and voice while catching up on the news. i know folk proposed this before the 2016 general election, but it is time to brung it back. so, i'm just gonna share the idea with all y'all in case you or someone you know has been struggling with over-exposure to trump like i have. symptoms include but are not limited to frowning hard at any new york accent, hurling objects at the sight of his face on television or in print, and yelling at the mention of his name regardless of time or place. i'm old enough to remember not liking donald trump back in the 1980s. he was all over television back then. i'd turn on entertainment tonight and there he'd be, blathering on with that bit of spittle at the corner of his month talking about how rich he wants everyone to think he is, how he dumped his wives because they had the audacity to want to get a word in edgewise, how he really wanted the state to murder the central park five and then doubling down on that shit after it became clear they weren't guilty, and generally boasting about how smart and clever he thinks he is while destroying atlantic city. it's not just that dude talks too much, its also that i can't stand the pitch, chaotic rhythm, and volume of his voice. like nails on a chalkboard ... a singer going sharp while singing a whitney houston song ... a kardashian. *wince* last week i realized that i need a break, but i have to consume news and work online for my job, so that makes it hard to avoid his ass. and that's when i came up with the totally unoriginal idea of trumpless tuesdays! i turned off the television, took a break from facebook, switched from npr in the car, and turned off news notifications. most importantly, i muted the following words on twitter --> trump, fox, mueller, paul ryan, russia, stormy, porn, fraud, monster, bigot, sexist, sexism, sexual assault, treason, indictment, money laundering, korea, china, nazi, nazi, nasi (these fools can't spell), bannon, miller, ivanka, jared, big mac, kfc, michael cohen, rudy giuliani, diet coke, kardashian, and kanye. i had to un-mute "indictment" because i'm a missourian and my governor is a creepy, unqualified, twice indicted thug, but otherwise eliminating these words did wonders for my timeline! trumpless tuesday was so damn good i'm expanding to thursday next week! may the force be with you, and you're welcome. posted by shark-fu at 2:13 pm 4 comments: newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) about me shark-fu view my complete profile followers blog archive ► 2019 (1) ► march (1) ▼ 2018 (4) ► october (1) ► august (2) ▼ may (1) trumpless tuesdays are so damn good ... ► 2017 (11) ► december (2) ► november (3) ► october (2) ► april (1) ► march (1) ► february (2) ► 2016 (5) ► june (4) ► january (1) ► 2015 (6) ► september (1) ► august (1) ► july (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ► 2014 (6) ► august (2) ► may (1) ► february (1) ► january (2) ► 2013 (24) ► october (2) ► september (2) ► august (1) ► july (2) ► june (4) ► may (1) ► april (3) ► february (5) ► january (4) ► 2012 (98) ► december (3) ► november (5) ► october (9) ► september (12) ► august (6) ► july (2) ► june (5) ► may (9) ► april (6) ► march (16) ► february (14) ► january (11) ► 2011 (167) ► december (7) ► november (12) ► october (13) ► september (9) ► august (19) ► july (14) ► june (15) ► may (14) ► april (15) ► march (14) ► february (19) ► january (16) ► 2010 (260) ► december (18) ► november (20) ► october (20) ► september (19) ► august (25) ► july (20) ► june (32) ► may (22) ► april (21) ► march (22) ► february (17) ► january (24) ► 2009 (259) ► december (19) ► november (21) ► october (19) ► september (18) ► august (25) ► july (26) ► june (23) ► may (20) ► april (25) ► march (16) ► february (22) ► january (25) ► 2008 (340) ► december (21) ► november (18) ► october (23) ► september (19) ► august (38) ► july (29) ► june (33) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (31) ► february (31) ► january (36) ► 2007 (404) ► december (29) ► november (45) ► october (43) ► september (37) ► august (38) ► july (31) ► june (29) ► may (30) ► april (30) ► march (30) ► february (30) ► january (32) ► 2006 (400) ► december (32) ► november (36) ► october (33) ► september (30) ► august (29) ► july (32) ► june (35) ► may (31) ► april (30) ► march (37) ► february (37) ► january (38) ► 2005 (319) ► december (44) ► november (36) ► october (27) ► september (32) ► august (27) ► july (32) ► june (30) ► may (29) ► april (24) ► march (25) ► february (13) awesome inc. theme. powered by blogger.
