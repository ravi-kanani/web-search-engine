cloudns features a premium anycast dns service in each of our anycast ddos protected dns plan we tailor for you (view anycast ddos protected dns plans). we maximize the speed, minimize downtime and provide our customers with the highest possible sla for each of our global locations. our customers have full redundancy and reliability on our network with reduced latency across each continent. a case for anycast dns's superiority now that we've explained the basics and given you a core definition of anycast dns, allow us to get into the details. these are some of the undeniable advantages you get when you use the cloudns anycast network: load balancing / speed boost: cloudns utilizes 27 pops ( points of presence ) on our extensive anycast network – available for every domain. this has an immediate positive effect on response times as queries are evenly distributed based on geographical source and servers load. improved reliability: forget about downtime and performance issues - our anycast network has multiple geographically dispersed servers that reroute traffic from any pops when there are issues that impair performance. our goal is to provide the highest sla when possible. multiple ddos protection providers: ddos attacks are quickly neutralized thanks to a large number of ddos mitigation providers that localize ddos attacks, restrict such attacks to only a portion of the anycast dns group and a portion of our network, minimizing the risk of downtime. multiple ddos cleaning facilities: our additional security layer detects malicious traffic and cleans the traffic before accessing our dns servers network. real hardware at each pop: forget about unreliable dns caching proxies! we use real hardware at each pop thus reducing the initial time for response for each domain making it almost instantaneous. route monitoring on every pop: our system automatically analyses the shortest paths for our pops, both local and global, and reroutes them through the lowest latency geographical location with zero downtime. dual stack network: our anycast network is a full dual stack network – ipv4 and ipv6 available at each of our pops. autonomous system: what truly puts our system in a league of its own is its autonomous responses issued within 15 seconds. a great advantage as it reduces the time for human intervention. 24/7 support: no matter what day, no matter when, you’re supported around the clock without a day of rest. cloudns provides continuous, uninterrupted network monitoring and support. our technical support team is online for you 24/7 by live chat and tickets. we can migrate your zones for free, read more here. ddos protected m $11.95/month ddos protected s $5.95/month premium m $4.95/month premium s $2.95/month dns zones: 75 25 75 25 dns records: 3,000 1,000 3,500 1,000 dns queries per month: unlimited unlimited unlimited 5m ? ddos protection: - - more details more details more details more details completely free trial. no credit cards required. no tricks. start free 30-day trial start free 30-day trial start free 30-day trial start free 30-day trial ddos protected m $11.95/month +4 anycast dns servers ddos protection for dns 75 dns zones unlimited records and queries 2 dns failover checks 150 mail forwards extended features completely free trial. no credit cards required. no tricks. start free 30-day trial ddos protected s $5.95/month +4 anycast dns servers ddos protection for dns 25 dns zones unlimited records and queries 1 dns failover check 50 mail forwards extended features completely free trial. no credit cards required. no tricks. start free 30-day trial premium m $4.95/month +4 anycast dns servers 75 dns zones 3,500 dns records unlimited dns queries per month 2 dns failover checks 150 mail forwards extended features completely free trial. no credit cards required. no tricks. start free 30-day trial premium s $2.95/month +4 anycast dns servers 25 dns zones 1,000 dns records 5m dns queries per month 1 dns failover check 50 mail forwards extended features completely free trial. no credit cards required. no tricks. start free 30-day trial need a custom quote? please write us at sales@cloudns.net for a custom quote, additional zones or set up of a branded dns service. company about us news contacts data centers feedback careers dns services premium dns ddos protected dns geodns dns failover reverse dns secondary dns dynamic dns dnssec enum dns zones services managed dns anycast dns enterprise dns private dns servers domain names ssl certificates ddos protected vps knowledgebase blog wiki features faq http api whmcs module hostbill module domain parking payment methods partnership affiliate program resellers api registrant educational materials registrant benefits and responsibilities whois social connection terms of service | privacy policy ©2020 cloudns all prices are final and include all required taxes. no other hidden charges!
