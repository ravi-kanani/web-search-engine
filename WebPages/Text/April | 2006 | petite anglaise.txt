petite anglaise april 27, 2006 transmission interrupted filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 8:21 am i will return. in a week or so. (tadpole and i are fine, please don’t worry!) comments off on transmission interrupted april 22, 2006 clamped filed under: tadpole rearing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 7:00 pm the air hostess motions us to a different seat, as our fellow passengers have unanimously ignored the allocations clearly marked on their tickets, with the result that mine and tadpole’s have already been taken. there is a ripple of laughter at my wake. tadpole, whom i imagined to be trotting obediently behind me, has found a bearded surrogate grandad she likes the look of, seated herself by his side, much to his amusement, and is now engrossed in fastening her seatbelt. i hasten to retrieve her, somewhat red-faced, and plonk her unceremoniously onto the window seat. “mummy?” “yees?” “can you hear my wee wee?” i note her glassy eyed expression, one which i am familiar with, as our family bathroom had mirror tiles on the back of the bathroom door. tadpole and i may not look alike, but sometimes, fleetingly, i see one of my own smirks or grimaces play across her face. a shadow falls over us: a businessman is examining his ticket with a puzzled air. i look up, prepare to explain, wearily, that the entire aircraft has been subjected to an impromptu game of musical chairs. i am, however, struck dumb by tadpole’s next move. “mummy! mummy!” she exclaims, painful, clamping fingers grabbing the front of my t-shirt. “look! i found your nipples! they all pointy!” i cast around for the button which will trigger my ejector seat. in vain. comments (155) april 21, 2006 the superficial filed under: navel gazing, single life — petiteanglaiseparis @ 11:16 am i choose my outfit, my undergarments with care, because i know from experience that a drink, with him, will lead to much, much more. in the bar, i bask in the glow of his attention, happy in this moment, knowing full well it will be fleeting. he seems most comfortable recounting anecdotes, in that theatrical way of his. his stories seem to form part of a cloak he draws around himself; a shield which i don’t even attempt to penetrate. superficiality is an integral part of the unspoken pact between us. i lie in bed, his sleeping body curled around mine, his arm around my waist, marvelling that someone can be so close, skin against mine, but simultaneously seem so remote, so inaccessible. when we part the next day and i hear the words i fully expected to hear – “well, i guess i’ll see you in a month, when i get back” – i feel a twinge of something i was determined not to feel. a brief pang of remorse that i may have been selling little pieces of myself to the lowest bidder. comments (82) april 18, 2006 limewired filed under: navel gazing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 1:01 am a new order obsessed fifteen year old is still trapped somewhere inside this thirty-something body: i will never cease to be a sucker for an old school synth. which goes some way, but by no means all, to explaining why instead of sleeping right now, i am listening to some freshly downloaded tiga on my headphones with the bass turned all the way up, revelling in the richly layered synths of “high school” and wishing i could be on a dancefloor, eyes closed, skin tingling, letting the sound wash over me. this petite anglaise wants to go clubbing. soon. to let out all of that pent-up naughtiness fizzing beneath the surface. the only ingredient lacking at the present time is willing, like-minded partners in crime (as i can’t exactly ask mr frog and his gang any longer, can i?). any readers who might be partial to electronica in the vitalic/tiga/miss kittin vein, feel free to drop me a line at the usual address. comments (85) older posts » search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com. post to cancel
