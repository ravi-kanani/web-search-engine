petite anglaise april 23, 2009 twins filed under: knocked up — petiteanglaiseparis @ 2:09 pm the first trimester of this pregnancy has been unexpectedly rough. there was the all day nausea, which seemed to peak in the evenings, making a nonsense of the phrase ‘morning sickness’. then there were the migraine-lite headaches that shadowed me from morning until night and the extreme fatigue, which meant that in the weeks immediately following our honeymoon i could barely manage to stay awake for five hours in a row. and then, last but not least, there was the big bleak cloud of despondency which settled above my head and refused to budge. it was difficult, under the circumstances, to feel thrilled about being pregnant, however much i’d looked forward to it, in theory. cue the guilt about not feeling more pleased. after all, the boy is a first time future dad, and i was anxious not to sully what should be a magical time. when i remarked to friends upon how much more difficult this pregnancy seemed compared to my last, six and a half years ago, their response was often framed as a question. ‘cath, are you sure you aren’t having twins?’ the thought had crossed my mind. indeed, my gmail status, at one point, read: ‘starting to worry i might be expecting a whole litter…’ twins run in my biological family, you see. non identical twins. the sort that can be hereditary because the females of the family are genetically predisposed to ‘over-egg the omelette’ every month. this is probably why it took me only a couple of weeks to get pregnant, both with tadpole and with baby n° 2, which is obviously a blessing. but after spending a few hours reading up on the subject on the internet, i was bemused to see that one source gave the odds on me having a multiple birth as 1 in 16. my mother, after having me, went on to have non identical twin boys. now, of course i’m well aware that there are many couples out there that would love to have twins, or who already have twins, and who think that i’m a selfish human being for preferring my babies to come one at a time, in an orderly, spaced-out fashion. i also know that we could, if necessary, find space in tadpole’s bedroom for two extra cots, and on the day of the birth i’d no doubt be thrilled to have two bundles of joy for the price of one. and why even have two breasts – sexual fantasies about multiple partners aside – if they can’t be suckled by two babies simultaneously? but when i found myself in the darkened room, stripped naked from the waist down, my stomach covered in a thick layer of lube, the first words i uttered to the nice lady doctor operating the ultrasound when the picture of the contents of my womb came into focus were: ‘phew! so there’s only the one in there, then?’ comments (82) april 7, 2009 happy filed under: tadpole rearing, tadpole says — petiteanglaiseparis @ 5:33 pm i am shelling peas in the kitchen while listening to some vintage aphex twin when i realise that tadpole has gone disturbingly quiet. ‘sweetie? what are you up to?’ i call, peering over the bar, from which vantage point i can see the whole of our open-plan apartment. save the bathroom and toilet, that is. there is no sign of tadpole, however, and i have a sudden, irrational vision of her drawing 3d pictures on the bathroom floor with a tube of toothpaste. ‘i’m doing a poo!’ shouts tadpole. ‘well… actually, i’ve finished doing my poo, and now i’m reading the book about the bunny.’ the people who designed our apartment thoughtfully built in some shelf space above the toilet, and this hosts our extensive ‘toilet book’ collection. highlights include our larson collection, the foreign editions of ‘petite’, several tomes by desproges and ‘the book about the bunny’, a.k.a. the bumper book of bunny suicides. tadpole loves poring over this, even though i hope/feel sure that she doesn’t really understand a) why a bunny would want to commit suicide, and b) how he’s planning to go about it in many of the instances illustrated. ‘you don’t have to read that on the toilet, you know,’ i tell her, when she emerges, finally, a full ten minutes later. ‘you can borrow books from the toilet library. as long as you put them back afterwards…’ which is why this morning, i found tadpole with her head bent over a copy of fellow blogger andre‘s if you’re happy and you know it‘ at the breakfast table. indeed, not just looking at it, but reproducing several of the doodles herself with the help of a biro she’d pilfered from my handbag. i do hope andre approves. comments (22) search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
