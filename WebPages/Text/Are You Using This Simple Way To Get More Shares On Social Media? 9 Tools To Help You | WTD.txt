9 tools to help you use social media by marianne manthey they‚Äôre all over pinterest. they‚Äôve taken over facebook, twitter and instagram. they‚Äôre inspiring. they‚Äôre silly. they‚Äôre sad and they‚Äôre happy. yes, you guessed right ‚Äì i‚Äôm talking about image quotes. have you seen photographs of inspiring landscapes with a quote neatly overlaid? or quotes in cool typography over a solid color background? those are image quotes. why image quotes get more shares on social media 1. people love quotes! 2. they help you connect with your readers because your audience can get to know you better by the types of quotes you share. 3. when people like a quote you‚Äôve shared, they‚Äôre more likely to pin it to their pinterest boards and share it on their facebook, twitter or instagram feeds. this produces more backlinks, increasing traffic to your blog and social media profiles. so you can see how using image quotes is a simple way to get more shares on social media. here‚Äôs how to do it. how to use image quotes in your blog find inspirational quotes that pertain to your niche. think inspirational quotes are cheesy? try a humorous quote. do you use block quotes in your blog posts? if you use an image quote instead, you‚Äôll have something on your post that‚Äôs ‚Äòpinnable‚Äô to pinterest. another idea is to share stats over an image. select a powerful image as a background, and you now have an incredible way to get your message across! image quotes are also good for turning your blog post titles into images that can be pinned or shared. add a catchy headline to a memorable image and you have a recipe for clicks and shares. how to create an image quote luckily for you, there are tons of websites that help you create image quotes quickly and easily. i‚Äôll walk you through an example so you can see just how easy it is. go to quozio.com. paste in a quote and author (if there is one). choose a pre-designed template. share your creation. click on one of the little social media buttons directly below the image or click ‚Äúkeep‚Äù to download it and then add it to a blog post. note that quozio adds a small attribution at the bottom of your image. here‚Äôs an example: wasn‚Äôt that easy? let‚Äôs take a look at a few more image quote tools‚Ä¶ quick and dirty: beginner tools here are a few more websites that are as easy to use as quozio. the nice thing about these tools is that you can create an image quote in under three minutes. because they use templates, you don‚Äôt have to fiddle with typography, colors or backgrounds. these websites are free and do not require you to create an account. recitethis recitethis has the best looking templates, but they do leave a rather noticeable watermark at the bottom of each image. the site includes a catalogue of quotes that are organized by category, making this a one-stop shop. post directly to pinterest, facebook, twitter, tumblr or stumbleupon. there is also a download button. pinwords pinwords has a few nice templates. choose from a selection of patterned backgrounds or upload your own background image. select one of six typographic themes, then paste in your quote. you can change the text color and move it around, but that‚Äôs about all the customization you get. again, it is super simple. pin it, like it, tweet it, post to tumblr or email it to yourself. pinstamatic pinstamatic has basic templates, and only allows you to share to pinterest from its website. but you can download the image by right clicking it, then uploading it to your blog or other social media account. pinstamatic does not add attribution to images. proquoter proquoter has simple templates that work well for block quotes. pin, tweet, like or share on google+. right click to download the image. getting fancy: intermediate tools beginner tools not cutting it for you?
