as i said in that post, the actors’ union equity helped spread the story by calling on actors to “unequivocally denounce” their fellow. yes, those exact words. equity has now backtracked, but it went to prove mr fox’s point. in the end equity had to do more than backtrack. on march 13th the guardian reported, equity apology to laurence fox sparks string of resignations. the entire race equality committee of equity has resigned in protest after the actors’ union apologised on its behalf for criticising laurence fox’s views on race and paid an out-of-court settlement to the actor after he threatened to sue them for libel. i am sure they will be greatly missed. the former star of the detective drama lewis also used his appearance on the bbc discussion show to insist it was “racist” for an audience member to call him “a white, privileged male”. “we’re the most tolerant, lovely country in europe,” he said at the time. “it’s so easy to throw the card of racism at everybody and it’s really starting to get boring now.” in the aftermath of his appearance, minority representatives of the actors’ union made a series of accusations on twitter against fox, saying he wanted to “berate and bully women of colour attempting to discuss issues of race and gender discrimination”. narrator’s voice: he didn’t really. on friday, the actors’ union issued a carefully worded statement apologising for the comments, with sources saying a payment had been made to the actor: “we are sorry that in the tweets he was called a ‘disgrace’ by equity. it was a mistake for equity as an organisation to criticise him in this way. nothing in equity’s later statement was intended as a slur on his character or views, or to suggest that he should be denied the ability to work. we would like to make that clear. equity and laurence fox condemn prejudice unequivocally in all its forms.” daniel york loh, the former chair of the race equality committee, said he and his eight other colleagues on the committee, elected by the union’s minority ethnic members, felt forced to resign as a result of the decision to apologise to the actor. i think that should read “as a result of the decision to apologise to their own member”. he tweeted: “equity and la*rence f*x can issue as many joint statements and apologies as they like. it’s nothing to do with me and i apologise for nothing.” if mr loh says that equity’s apology is nothing to do with him, i assume that means that he has not just resigned from the union’s race equality committee but from the union itself – which in practice would mean that he has resigned from being an actor. a principled decision indeed. fox, a member of a well-known acting family, previously said he was concerned he would not be able to work following the intervention from the equity race equality committee. a source close to fox said a particular concern was its call for him to be “unequivocally denounced” for his comments on race, which could have reduced his ability to earn money from roles and make a living to enable him to look after his family. having lost its race equality committee, equity might like to see if it can manage without replacing this expensive luxury. march 22nd, 2020 | 7 comments who is dr. li wenliang?

the thought crosses my mind frequently, but with particular force as i chaired a discussion at the annual conference of the people who run britain’s orchestras. the talk turned to education and i expressed my fervent belief that teaching children to read music is the key that opens up everything. first jolt: the music director of arts council england (ace), no less, vehemently disagreed with me. musical literacy doesn’t matter much, she declared. second jolt: in the ensuing discussion not a single person spoke in my favour. more than 100 people were in the room, all engaged in running orchestras that depend on instrumentalists who can sight-read to an incredible level, and not one agreed that teaching children to read music was a good idea. after the event i had coffee with someone in the audience. “of course nobody sided with you,” she claimed. “everyone here depends on ace subsidy. nobody will contradict publicly what the ace music director says.” this was not a singular event. as mr morrison writes in his times article, “the arts world is tolerant, as long as you’re left wing and anti-brexit”, i wouldn’t recount this small personal trauma except that it suddenly seems so relevant. today the excellent website artsprofessional published freedom of expression, a report based on a large survey it conducted last autumn into censorship and self-censorship in the cultural sector. by promising anonymity to participants, it has lifted the lid on a shocking state of affairs. here’s a sector that prides itself on tolerance and free speaking. in reality it seems that the opposite is true. nearly 80 per cent of participants agreed that “workers in the arts who share controversial opinions risk being professionally ostracised”. you can speak freely within your arts organisation, it seems, only if you conform to a narrow set of political and social views. take brexit. i knew that most arts people were fervently against it, but i didn’t realise how much pressure was put on pro-brexiteers working in the arts to, basically, shut up. one participant claimed that “in our organisation those who voted to leave the eu have been ostracised”. another noted that “17.4 million voted for brexit”, but that “most of the opinions of these people, on many subjects, would lose them employment in the publicly funded arts sector”. the “artsprofessional” survey he mentions was introduced here and the findings can be read here (subscription required). i did wonder why teaching children to read music has come to be regarded as a bad thing. i suspect it is part of the same phenomenon that has caused the oxford classics faculty to propose dropping homer and virgil from the first part of an oxford classics degree. the oxford student newspaper reports that it …has been notified about a proposal by the classics faculty to remove the study of homer’s iliad and virgil’s aeneid from the mods syllabus, a decision which has surprised many across the faculty. this proposal forms part of a series of reforms aimed to modernise the first stage of the classics degree, known as moderations (mods), which take place during hilary term of second year for all students taking classics courses across the university. the mods course, which is assessed by a set of ten exams at the end of hilary, has been increasingly criticised in recent years, due to the attainment gaps found between male and female candidates, as well as between candidates who have studied latin and/or greek to a-level (course i) and those who have not (course ii). the removal of virgil and homer papers, which take up two out of the ten mods papers, have been marketed as a move that will reduce the attainment gaps and thus improve access to the subject. educational “attainment gaps” between the official oppressors and the officially oppressed are to be avoided at all costs, except that of providing teaching of a high and even standard to all. what are they afraid of? when the victorians saw an attainment gap between the upper and the labouring classes they did things like build a university for working people, funded by contributions from the meagre paypackets of quarrymen and farmers. when the early feminists saw an attainment gap between men and women they attained to such effect that the gender gap in the universities is now the other way round. they closed educational gaps by pushing upwards. we don’t even have the honesty to openly push downwards. february 23rd, 2020 | 28 comments this video has been viewed 726 million times natalie solent (essex) · arts & entertainment · european union · historical views · humour · sui generis europe – the final countdown january 31st, 2020 | 26 comments has the bbc stopped putting bromide in its actors’ tea?

[…] critics of the conservative government’s record of support for the low carbon and renewables sector blamed the treasury’s dramatic cut in subsidies to the solar power industry for the sudden loss of employment. solar panel installers were among the many businesses connected to the industry that went bust after the treasury cut subsidy payments by 65% in 2015 before abolishing them altogether last year. obligatory “princess bride” clip for those benighted souls who haven’t seen it. january 16th, 2020 | 17 comments - (comments are closed) two snapshots of our times natalie solent (essex) · arts & entertainment · civil liberty & regulation · education & academia · mindless "inequality" blather · sexuality · uk affairs 1) eurogamer reports, pc specialist ad banned for perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes an advert for a bespoke pc retailer was banned for perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes of women. the tv ad, below, for uk retailer pc specialist, begins with a computer exploding, then shows three men getting excited over using a pc specialist pc for gaming, making music and coding. […] the advertising standards authority received eight complaints from people who said the ad perpetuated harmful gender stereotypes by depicting men in roles that were stereotypically male, and implied it was only men who were interested in technology and computers. pc specialist responded to the watchdog to say its customer base was 87.5 per cent male, aged between 15 and 35 years, and “their product, branding and service had been developed for and aimed at that target audience and the characters in the ad therefore represented a cross-section of the pc specialist core customer base”. ten years ago the advertising standards authority would have said something like, “we just want you to stop portraying women as laughably incompetent at computers until a man helps them. surely that’s fair? after all, some women are great at computers.” at that time it must have seemed ridiculous to make a fuss about freedom of speech when faced with such a reasonable request. but when the beast is fed it grows stronger. 2) and from the bbc: sheffield students paid to tackle racist language on campus a university is to hire 20 of its own students to challenge language on campus that could be seen as racist. the university of sheffield is to pay students to tackle so-called “microaggressions” – which it describes as “subtle but offensive comments”. they will be trained to “lead healthy conversations” about preventing racism on campus and in student accommodation. vice-chancellor koen lamberts said the initiative wanted to “change the way people think about racism”. the students will be paid £9.34 per hour as “race equality champions”, working between two and nine hours per week to tackle “microaggressions” in the university. these are described as comments or actions which might be unintentional, but which can cause offence to a minority group. it gives examples of what it means by microaggression – such as: “stop making everything a race issue” “why are you searching for things to be offended about?” “where are you really from?” “i don’t want to hear about your holiday to south africa. it’s nowhere near where i’m from” “being compared to black celebrities that i look nothing like” rather than being about controlling people’s speech, the university says it is “opening up a conversation”. judging from the first two examples, they are allowed to open the conversation but you are not allowed to close it. january 14th, 2020 | 25 comments - (comments are closed) plus ça change… patrick crozier (twickenham) · arts & entertainment i’ve been rootling around in the samizdata archives (more of which to come, perhaps) and i found this: in the bubbled, hypocritical mind of some in hollywood, the only reason gervais crossed a line is because he went after them. had he been as relentless in ripping apart sarah palin, her young children, jesus christ, or george w. bush, today the comedian would be celebrated as “edgy” and “courageous” — because only in hollywood is throwing red meat to a hard-left crowd considered “edgy” and “courageous.” but gervais didn’t do that. instead, he trained his satirical fire on hollywood power and today there’s serious talk about whether or not the comedian will be brought back to the golden globes next year as host. as you can probably guess from the mentions of sarah palin and george w. bush this is from a while ago – january 19th 2011, to be precise. ever got the feeling you’ve been cheated? january 12th, 2020 | 15 comments - (comments are closed) samizdata quote of the day samizdata illuminatus (arkham, massachusetts) · arts & entertainment · slogans & quotations you don’t go to a cultural war with the army you want, you go with the army you have. – ‘mary contrary‘ january 7th, 2020 | 24 comments - (comments are closed) ricky gervais, the best man at a wedding who shouts out “don’t marry, mate!” johnathan pearce (london) · arts & entertainment · humour ricky gervais’s opening comments at the golden globes in hollywood (i assume he is not doing them ever again) are rightly being lauded around the non-pc parts of the internet/media world for telling much of hollywood how totally, eye-wateringly awful it is. seems a tad harsh, though – he’s a bit like the guy who comes to a party, takes a lot of the decent wine, insults the guests and then leaves. seems a tad boorish. but maybe i am being squeamish and boorishness in these times may be necessary. i get the impression that a high-water mark of pcness, or “wokeness”, to coin a term, may have been reached. maybe even last december’s crushing of mr corbyn’s uk labour party was an indicator. (for anyone living on a remote desert island in recent years, here is a definition of “woke”.) so what is the context here and how do we end with a situation where a movie industry reaches the point where a british entertainer hammers practitioners in this way? one sign of what is going wrong is how famous franchises are “rebooted” – james bond is getting older and being replaced, at least in terms of the person with the iconic 007 number, by a black woman who has his serial number (possibly); terminator, star wars, dr who….the list of increasingly “woke” productions goes on. the accountants aren’t happy as far as viewing figures and box office takings are concerned, it seems. of course, as we have seen on discussions on this blog before, some business tycoons might be willing to see some of their revenues decline if it means winning a longer term war to change the “culture”, but shareholders’ patience has its limits. if proctor and gamble takes a hit by insulting men as toxic, well, even the most pc chief executives will be booted out eventually. but for the penny to drop, so to speak, it appears necessary for unvarnished truths to be dished out, and quite possibly, gervais is ultimately doing the sector a favour, even if swearing at guests is a bit, well, off. i do think that the very fact that someone such as ricky gervais can stand up in front of hollywood luvvies and more or less telll them they are a bunch of narcissistic, ignorant twats is quite something and suggests we have reached a sort of tipping point. it even got mentioned on the bbc this morning. ok, i hear you cry, is gervais’s intervention necessary? if “woke” films lose money and netflix/other hoover up the market, that is capitalism in action in its most brutal and bracing way. that of course is all true. and there have been and will be films made that upset fans and conventional wisdom, whether from a traditional conservative or socially radical point of view. so long as it is a free market, that’s fine. (but when the state intrudes with subsidies, this becomes a big problem.) but the benefit at times of having someone such as gervais drop some bombs on an awards ceremony is that paradoxically, he highlights the place of awards events in business sectors. industry awards ceremonies are marketing exercises, and there is, as with all types of business, a law of diminishing returns if there are lots of them: the more awards there are, the less each one matters over time. the decisions about who gets what gong and for what are subject to lots of political eye-gouging. a lot is at stake in terms of pr, contracts and connections. and in a slightly less venal way, awards are a chance for people to meet old friends, make some new contacts and have a glass or two in convivial surroundings (and there’s nothing wrong about that, by the way). however, for all their annoying qualities and diminishing returns, awards events can also be a chance for an industry that is a bit under the cosh to put its best faces forward, to plead a case, to show it still counts. there are awards events for every sector under the sun, from architecture to it. funnily enough some of the smarter hollywood people (yes, they exist) probably know they have a problem with how the sector has been going, and gervais touched on some of them: competition from new media; stale franchises and lack of originality, and yes, a liberal-left culture that alienates a large number of potential customers. the industry is vulnerable if actors and actresses lecture people about their carbon footprints or about sex, and then fly on private jets and hang out with the likes of jeffrey epstein. so awards ceremonies, even when someone like gervais is nasty to the guests, have their uses, sometimes if only to tell a sector that it has a dose of the flu and needs to get better. they might even encourage change if the reaction is serious enough. in my own industry of financial media, we have awards ceremonies too, and it is often quite a tricky point to know what sort of man or woman to nominate as the sort of warm-up act. a few years ago i went to a black tie gala evening run by an investment industry body. the bloke doing the warm-up gags was a hard-left socialist by the name of frankie boyle. it was like inviting lenin to talk to the institute of directors. boyle was disgusting and unpleasant, and people walked out. the golden globe audience, methinks, got off quite lightly. do read the gervais speech. it is glorious. i do think, reconsidering my article from a day ago, that gervais was pretty out of order swearing at the crowd, and part of me wishes that he hadn’t done that, and that we could have a hollywood that was classy and elegant. but rather as with donald trump, a vulgar, rough and no-nonsense person is necessary to burn down what exists before the rebuilding can take place. or to use an expression from the austrian economist joseph schumpeter, we need creative destruction. january 6th, 2020 | 14 comments - (comments are closed) the attorney general reads “‘twas the night before christmas” natalie solent (essex) · arts & entertainment · how very odd! · sui generis · uk affairs like it says on the tin, here is a video in which geoffrey cox reads ‘twas the night before christmas. no political point is being made. i just thought he read it rather well. if the politics gig doesn’t work out, a more respectable career awaits him as a voiceover artist. happy [insert festival of choice here, including but not limited to christmas and wednesday] to all our readers. december 25th, 2019 | 8 comments - (comments are closed) older entries » who are we?
