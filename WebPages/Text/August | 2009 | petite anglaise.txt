petite anglaise august 27, 2009 quickie filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 2:52 pm in honour of official ‘french kissing’ publication day, i just wanted to answer a lot of the queries i’ve been receiving on facebook and by email about the novel’s availability abroad. as things currently stand, i only have a doubleday canada release date – march 2010. the penguin uk version should be available in the high street bookshops in the uk, throughout the commonwealth and in a selection of english language bookshops abroad (including wh smiths in paris). in the meantime, if you are outside the uk and wish to get your hands on a copy, your best bet is probably to order it from the book depository – it’s reasonably priced and they will ship it anywhere in the world for free. i do hope you enjoy it. so. shameless self-promotion over. i shall now go back to fretting about what my friends and family think of it. aie! comments (37) august 19, 2009 impatience filed under: knocked up — petiteanglaiseparis @ 1:52 pm i’m fed up of being pregnant. ‘i honestly feel like time has slowed to a crawl,’ i moan to the boy as i toss and turn, trying to find a comfortable position in bed. ‘i swear, this has been the longest seven months of my entire life…’ ‘not long to wait now,’ he replies, doing his utmost to sound both positive and comforting. officially, though, d-day is still another nine, maybe ten weeks away. and that doesn’t feel like ‘not long’ at all. i know i should count my blessings. i’m not on enforced bed rest, or suffering from gestational diabetes or high blood pressure. i’m simply twelve kilos heavier, with occasional shooting pains in my left buttock (sciatica) and an odd tingly burning sensation in my left knee when i walk (also sciatica). getting to sleep at night is a challenge (not least because if i don’t manage to fall asleep before the boy, i have to work on tuning out his snoring) and i often end up surfing the internet at silly o’clock, marvelling at the veins in madonna’s arms or chuckling (quietly) at photos of lolcats to pass the time until i’m finally too exhausted to fidget and deem it time to return to bed. by day, aside from making inroads into the towering pile of books on my bedside table, developing new television addictions and doing the odd bit of book release related stuff, i’m not really gainfully employed just now. with maternity leave looming, i decided i’d rather not rush into working on a new project straight away. there couldn’t be a better time, i figured, to take step back from the whirlwind of the past three years and give myself the space to work out just where i want to go from here. but the inactivity is beginning to weigh on me, and tadpole’s prolonged absences this summer certainly haven’t helped. since we returned from our family holiday in turkey, in mid-july, she’s been away more often than not, and is currently with her french grandparents, returning to paris only a couple of days before she’s due to start ‘big school’. without a doubt she’s much better off elsewhere, doing lots of fun activities with people who can waddle more than a few metres without running short of breath. but i miss her. i miss our cuddles in the morning, her touching solicitude (‘mummy, will you be alright on the stairs?’) and the kisses she has taken to planting on my protruding bellybutton. mindful of her sometime reluctance to speak on the phone, i decided to set up a tadpolemail™ account in an attempt to spur her into keeping in touch while she’s away. typically my daughter’s messages are short, sweet, peppered with the sorts of mistakes french people usually make when speaking english and, last but not least, guaranteed to bring a tear to my eye. hello mummy i want to have my bath in a minute and i love to talk to you at the telephone lots of kisses from tadpole xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx comments (63) search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
