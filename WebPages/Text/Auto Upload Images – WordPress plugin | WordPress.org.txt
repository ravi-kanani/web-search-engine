(typically when i import a blog it's for a client who wants a site re-built from scratch but wants to keep all their old posts. sometimes thousands of posts! having to go and re-save each post, and re-attach the featured image to each post is tough. my current client also has at least one pdf on each page as well.) it works! neilius february 11, 2020 i've tried many plugins, but this is the first one that actually does what it says. thanks! it would be nice to have an option to process existing posts - have hundreds of old posts. until then i'll just open each post in turn, and press update. for me works perfect! aioex february 2, 2020 i wanted thank you for developing and maintaining this plugin. for me it works perfect and saved me a lot of time. all the best! plugin not upload this image to my server kienvictory november 7, 2019 hello, i have a product description: <img src="//ae01.alicdn.com/kf/utb896udse_4iujk43fqq6z.fpxap.jpg" /> plugin not upload this image to my server. i need to add https, and plugin start working. for example: <img src="https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/utb896udse_4iujk43fqq6z.fpxap.jpg" /> great! yondermann october 11, 2019 it does what it says and does it without failure. excellent plugin i wish i had know about it before! it would be even better if it could set the uploaded image into featured image too! read all 53 reviews contributors & developers ‚Äúauto upload images‚Äù is open source software. the following people have contributed to this plugin.contributors ali irani translate ‚Äúauto upload images‚Äù into your language. interested in development?
