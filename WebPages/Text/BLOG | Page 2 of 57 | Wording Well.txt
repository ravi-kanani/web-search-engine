firstly, starting a blog in college is a great decision. apart from improving your writing skills, it helps you form a strong network, build your personal brand, and push your creative boundaries while making money on the side. it sure is difficult to manage a busy college schedule and run a blogâ€¦ but it is not impossible! all you need to learn is how to manage your time effectively. if you do that, there is no stopping you from being productive in every aspect of your life! here are 5 tips to succeed as a blogger if you are an extremely busy college student. tip #1: allocate time to blog sometimes, in spite of having the intentions to blog, itâ€™s easy to get busy with college and ignore your blog in the process. in order to take blogging seriously, you need to set aside time specifically for doing tasks related to your blog. from brainstorming ideas and curating content to scheduling and promoting it, blogging is a time-consuming process. however, if you give yourself 2 hours every day or devote a few hours every weekend to it, you are likely to make better progress. ultimately, having a schedule and organizing your tasks lets you be more disciplined and productive. that way, you donâ€™t even feel guilty choosing one thing over the other. tip #2: prioritize wisely while you have allocated blogging time, itâ€™s important to prioritize wisely as well. after all, there is no denying that focusing on academics is of utmost importance and nothing should take precedence over that. for instance, if you need an essay written now, you need to focus on your submissions rather than spending time on your blog. so, be prepared for unexpected delays and tasks added to your to-do list. plan your days accordingly and donâ€™t lose focus of the bigger picture. tip #3: maintain an editorial calendar you might think you can hurriedly jot notes on your phone and schedule posts when you feel like it. this way of working is not only haphazard but can also affect the quality of your work. instead, why not maintain an editorial calendar? doing this will let you streamline your thoughts and consistently post in a timely manner. donâ€™t be too hard on yourself by posting every day or every second day. studies have shown that posting daily on your blog wonâ€™t work. determine the time you can allocate to blogging, decide on a posting schedule, and stick to it. give yourself deadlines so you know you have to publish a post in the given time period. read more Â« 1 2 3 4 â€¦ 57 Â» wording well: one of the top 50 freelance writing blogs! wording well: one of the top 25 copywriting blogs! search for: search click to visit: my brandyourself profile write your way to your first #1k 30 days or less to freelance writing success are you in need of some cash?
