noticed, but i have been on hiatus over the past several months, for which i apologize profusely. i wanted to thank those who continue to stop by and catch up on my posts. i started this blog back in spring of 2019 and i was writing so much, so frequently, that eventually i hit burnout about two months after my pax west trip last year. in addition, my hobby interests have turned away from gaming and writing to other things for a time, namely tarot (the happy fault of sayonara wild hearts), drawing, and online community building. i tend to go through periods of ‚Äúhobby rotation‚Äù where i‚Äôm really into one thing or another for a half year or so and then move to something else, eventually circling back to an intense focus on gaming. i do plan on writing more in the future when the burnout wears off. it would warm my heart to see some of you on instagram in the mean time. i‚Äôve included a few of my art posts from instagram between paragraphs below for anyone interested. üôÇ since you last heard from me i‚Äôve mostly been playing dead by daylight on pc with friends when i do game. i did play and finish pokemon shield, which was fun but too easy, per the usual for pokemon games, and at the middle point of the story, the game was completely and clearly a rush job, which was rather disappointing. when the dlc releases, i will move my collection over via pokemon home and likely start breeding competitive pokemon again. i have both a massive iv breeding collection as well as a hefty competitive-grade shiny collection, so i very much look forward to seeing those on the switch! during autumn i put a lot of time into the digimon cyber sleuth port for the switch, which is what i wish pokemon could be like, a more mature experience following it‚Äôs audience as they age. i started writing a post about it, though never finished it. here‚Äôs the beginning of that review for those curious: ‚Äúi need to talk about digimon, the other beloved ‚Äòmon of my life. digimon cyber sleuth complete edition released last week on the switch recently and goodness gracious is it good! this is everything i ever wanted in a digimon game, everything i‚Äôve wanted in a pok√©mon game for that matter, and the switch port is simply flawless. game industry take note, this is what a switch port should look like. it‚Äôs smooth and clean, functions perfectly, and has no bugs to speak of, with high quality graphics. the only thing it‚Äôs missing is an english dub, but i can live with that. cyber sleuth takes place in its own digimon universe that reminds me the of the meta narrative found in the digimon tamers tv series.‚Äù i‚Äôm also digging back into fire emblem three houses, starting with the ashen wolves dlc and a golden deer play through. next up on my hype list is animal crossing new horizons, and i want to do a village life ‚Äúin character‚Äù diary if i can. i hope to find some motivation to start blogging again with animal crossing, but i don‚Äôt want to force it or it will make the writing fatigue come right back. thank you for supporting backlog crusader and for bearing with me! i appreciate all of my readers very much. if you would like to stay in touch with me, please feel free to visit either of the discord servers i admin where you will find me in the chat daily. üôÇ love, angie share this: twitter facebook reddit like this: like loading... posted in:

discord communities ‚Äì open invitation! by angie | backlog crusader on december 12, 2019 long story short: i admin two sizable discord communities and i wanted to make invitations available to readers and the gaming blogger community. both of these servers are 18+ only and lgbtq+ inclusive. details below! the first discord is called the lodge of sorceresses and it is approaching three years old with a very solid core of regular active members who would love to welcome some new folks into the community. we used to be a gwent (the witcher card game) server with a focus on minority player inclusion, but have since expanded to be a general gaming server for everyone, and we have kept the witcher theme in the user roles and channel names. you can see more details about the group and its history in this post. regardless of the feminine name of the lodge, anyone is welcome! join the lodge of sorceresses here! if you read my post a while back about sayonara wild hearts, you‚Äôll know that i really love tarot cards both for their gorgeous art and their usefulness as a mental health maintenance tool. i‚Äôve started a discord community called tarotholics, we have grown to over 500 members in less than a month and a half, and we have been getting absolutely amazing feedback about our community setup and activities. if you have any interest in learning tarot (persona series fans perhaps?) or read tarot already, we would be more than happy to help you along your fool‚Äôs journey. we also have a fully prized yuletide tarot card design contest accepting entries through december 25th. join tarotholics here! hope to see you guys in one of these groups soon! ‚ù§ share this: twitter facebook reddit like this: like loading... posted in: community, discord, gamer, gaming, geek,

november 15, 2019november 21, 2019 yennefer. who is she, really? in the witcher 3 we see her relentlessly pursuing her goals across multiple continents, taking down any obstacles in her way. yes, she cares passionately for her love, geralt, but he won‚Äôt distract her from her ultimate goals. despite their closeness, she keeps extremely important secrets from the witcher during their travels, yet he trusts her implicitly. she is strong and wise, confident and skilled, and a timeless beauty. their romance is legendary in the witcher universe, literally. continue reading ‚Äúwolven storm ‚Äì

demonstrated that video games as an art form are capable of delivering writing on par with the best narratives that exist over all forms of media. the world of planescape offered prose so invigorating and eloquent, storytelling so pristine and cohesive that it captivated creative minds for decades to come. in its stead, many games posed to be the promised heroes, ready to cash in on that promise but unfortunately, no one managed to soar as high‚Ä¶ until now. of all iterations that could have been, few could imagine that the savior of video gaming prose would take upon such an interesting form: bare naked, hungover, laying in his filth in the middle of a ravaged motel room, awoken from eternal slumber by a hellish clarion call. rise and shine, detective. welcome to revachol. continue

me feeling somewhat nostalgic lately and i wanted to expand a little on my older piece about how video games influenced the different phases of my life. it is less common than you‚Äôd expect for a non-sport hobby to stay with a child into their later adult life. what is it about video games that allow them to stick with us on such a deep, sentimental level for so many years? continue reading

so enthusiasm might cloud my judgment, but i cannot help but feel that neo cab is one of the coolest games i‚Äôve played in a while. it is a game that does not only capture the general aesthetic of the setting (think neon lights, cheesy synths, high-tech gizmos), but its fundamental core: a struggle of an individual faced with a soul-crushing march of high-tech corporations. and neo cab achieves that not by projecting an image of some distant dystopian future. instead, it narrows the gap between reality and the imagination until i could not help but think that the world it has described is waiting for us just around the corner. continue reading ‚Äúneo cab (pc) review ‚Äì a dystopian uber simulator‚Äù share this: twitter facebook reddit like this: like loading... posted in: cyberpunk,
