bean sprouts one family's search for the good life friday, september 10, 2010 upcycled stained glass my sister stephanie's degree is in glass and ceramics. she did stained glass making, glass blowing, throwing pots on a wheel, all that sort of stuff. the other week she and i went to a reclamation yard and bought £25 worth of old leaded windows. then we chopped them up and reassembled them into panes for my front door. my front door used to be pretty ugly. it was varnished (unevenly) with a horrible reddish-brown varnish. it had ten long narrow panes of unattractive patterned glass, and unpleasant knobs, handles and latches. it didn't bother me that much, but it certainly didn't make me smile every time i entered or left the house. now it is painted a handsome steely blue. it has smart new brass door furniture (not in the picture) and it has beautiful and unique upcycled leaded glass in the top and bottom (only the top panes are pictured). needless to say, it makes me smile every time i walk through it, or even walk past it. posted by melanie rimmer at 6:22 pm no comments: links to this post email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest wednesday, september 08, 2010 skein of geese this morning as i was returning home from the school run i had to stop in a queue of traffic only a couple of hundred yards from my door. i only caught the occasional glimpse of the reason for the delay, but i could clearly hear the sound of a farmer herding his cows across the road. i didn't mind waiting. it was a beautiful blue-sky morning promising a fine early autumn day. the hedgerows were heavy with deep red hawthorn berries and i began to contemplate which route to take with the dog today on our daily walk. as i was waiting, a skein of geese honked noisily overhead. i love living here. posted by melanie rimmer at 11:03 am no comments: links to this post email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest newer posts older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) subscribe to bean-sprouts by email click here to send email to melanie follow bean sprouts on twitter about me melanie rimmer cheshire, united kingdom five of us live in a very small ex-council house with a very small garden on the edge of farmland. we grow some of our food. we keep chickens and bees. we try to be "green", whatever that means. view my complete profile followers recent comments loading... categories food (209) family (178) allotment (137) gardening (134) frugal (95) challenges (90) self sufficiency (79) shopping (70) crafts (69) energy (68) recycling (68) news (64) friends (58) recipes (54) chickens (52) books (44) philosophy (43) permaculture (42) vegetarian (41) bees (38) ethics (37) drinks (36) baking (34) preserving (31) brewing (30) cultures (27) music (27) organic (27) house (26) activism (25) biodiversity (24) funny (24) seeds (24) quilts (22) compost (21) trees (21) foraging (20) construction (14) transport (14) competitions (13) moon (13) weeds (12) pests (11) water (11) festivals (10) knitting (7) poetry (7) sun (7) barter (5) birds (5) cycling (4) movies (4) drawing (3) interviews (3) land (3) april 1st (2) art (2) cats (2) dyeing (1) shopping ethics (1) blog archive ► 2012 (1) ► february (1) ▼ 2010 (46) ▼ september (2) upcycled stained glass skein of geese ► july (1) ► june (16) ► april (13) ► march (7) ► february (1) ► january (6) ► 2009 (32) ► december (5) ► november (22) ► april (1) ► february (4) ► 2008 (251) ► december (2) ► november (14) ► october (10) ► august (12) ► july (21) ► june (18) ► may (41) ► april (31) ► march (32) ► february (37) ► january (33) ► 2007 (490) ► december (35) ► november (52) ► october (60) ► september (72) ► august (41) ► july (52) ► june (30) ► may (31) ► april (28) ► march (31) ► february (28) ► january (30) ► 2006 (183) ► december (28) ► november (28) ► october (28) ► september (29) ► august (24) ► july (28) ► june (18) interesting links 1 million against nuclear power abe books - like amazon but used adbusters asda watch big green switch braamekraal farm british blog directory carbolic soap co. centre for alternative technology chiltern seeds climate cartoons corporate watch craigslist - buy or sell second hand goods down the lane downsizer.net ebay - buy something second-hand ethical mall farmer's markets freeconomy - helping each other not for profit, just for the love of it freecycle - changing the world one gift at a time friends of the earth bookshop frugal living in the uk hedgewitch's forum henriette's herbal blog hugg - like digg but green i count - stop climate chaos it's not easy being green leeds sustainability network lehman's lesbian gardens lifeisland.org - support for manor garden allotments society manchester climate forum national society of allotment and leisure gardens neeps!
