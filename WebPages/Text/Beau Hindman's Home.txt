#blaugust2019 one of the best thing to do in an mmorpg is own a home. housing has always been one of those game design elements that is often done poorly, or even not at all, so it’s awesome when it’s done well. frankly, i think many players do not even use housing or do not even care about it when it’s there, but that’s fine. housing is very important for those of us who really want to feel immersed in a virtual world — especially during, say, my immersion project. black desert online has some of the best — if not the best — housing i have ever played with. i’m surprised i feel that way since it is what i call “instanced apartment blocks” but is done so well that it feels much more realistic. normally i would prefer housing that was out in the world and that took up actual space in the game world. in vanguard, for example, players literally located a plot, built a home, and then the home was there, in the world, for all players to see and visit. continue reading “is this the best housing in an online game? maybe!

5) use “role-play” speech. not thus and thou’s, but avoid modern day speech and references. try to stay in character. this is easy to do, and fun! 6) perma-death. if my character dies, he’s done. i am considering an amount of time that he would have to be “dead” for (say 2 months) before another character would have to perform a ceremony to “rez” him. otherwise, he’s just gone. i am considering this for bdo. i found it very effective, and made my play so much more fun. bdo offers a “family” group that allows me to pass on or share items with my other characters. bdo is awesome for permadeath! 7) realistic trade: my character has to make a living. trade is the most common, in a “real life” setting. so, with a little adventuring, i will be a trader. i can only sell my trade goods at brokers that are in certain cities, like khal, tawar galan… in bdo, there are so many options for trade. i think i will specialize in a crafted good and will look into the actual trade system that is built into the game. it’s a bit confusing, though. 8 ) a “home base.” i have to nominate (my home will be the place) a place that will act as my true home. i can only check my mail there, and have to go there or an inn to log out. i already have a home in bdo! the housing is instanced, but many houses share the same address. you can also open your home’s doors and windows and can literally see the outside world, including players. it’s pretty special, really, some of the best housing i’ve ever seen. 9) only use a physical, blank map that needs to be filled out by me, in real life. use landmarks and the lay of the land to get around. this has proven to be much more difficult than i thought. but fun! for bdo, i might print out a map but i am also considering using the in-game map. i can remove all markers on it, so it pretty much acts like a blank map. i can zoom in on it, which could be done with a physical map as well. the physical map is so cool, though, so i might print one out ugh, not sure! 10) mods: mods are basic programs that can be installed into a game’s base folder, that will add things to your hud or interface. basically, they are user made “helpers” that will show information such as percentage of health and other numbers that might not be allowed by a fantasy setting. even a science fiction based mmo might not show some of the information that some mods do. so i am not going to allow mods for the gathering of more information than is normally available. mod’s can be used to minimize information, such as drokui, which can take away shortcut boxes and mob percentages. so, a mod can be used to minimize but not to give extra information. not sure about mods with bdo, but it doesn’t need any, really. it has so many options already! 11) weather: if the mmo has a good weather system, or at least a good enough weather system as well as a good day/night cycle (if the game world has day/night) then there must be realistic limits put on how long a character can adventure without rest. even heroic characters need rest. for example, my little raki ranger in vanguard is not a hero. he stumbles through fights and barely escapes alive. i will allow him one and a half day’s adventuring max before he needs to rest. and to rest he would need to find a campfire, a house, or some other shelter and either physically lay down or at least restrict his movement for at least another cycle of day or night. (of course, the timing will be tweaked.) if the weather becomes poor, but is not that bad, my character can adventure like normal, but would need to cut his adventuring time down by half a day. if the weather becomes severe, he (or she!) would need to find shelter or a campfire. he would need to rest there until the weather passes. i am still working on penalties if he cannot find shelter. this is perfect for bdo — i have a backpack with some campfire kits in it, and can cook, and can even make a tent if i need to! 12) food: some mmo’s (like eq2) will already tell you when your character is hungry and thirsty. i will have to check in most of my current mmo’s but there will be a set amount of time for my character to go before he needs to rest and eat. possibly after half a day of adventuring would he need to rest and eat a meal. i will set a timer in bdo and will eat every 6 hours (in game time) or so. again, bdo has so many options for something like this, this will be easy. that’s all of them for now, but i feel confident that these rules still hold up when i need them to. i’m excited to get back into a game — into a virtual world — and settle into another good stretch of adventure. the first time i did the immersion project, i so fell in love with my character that i wrote stories about him… i still think about him! see you in game. beau posted bybeau hindman august 11, 2019 posted inwriting tags: blaugust leave a comment on using the rules of immersion in black desert online #blaugust2019 posts navigation 1 2 3 … 342 older posts search for: archives archives select month october 2019 (2) september 2019 (1) august 2019 (4) july 2019 (1) january 2019 (1) november 2018 (3) october 2018 (2) august 2018 (1) july 2018 (2) june 2018 (2) may 2018 (1) january 2018 (1) november 2017 (1) september 2017 (2) august 2017 (1) july 2017 (1) june 2017 (1) may 2017 (1) april 2017 (2) march 2017 (1) october 2016 (11) september 2016 (2) august 2016 (5) july 2016 (7) may 2016 (3) april 2016 (4) february 2016 (3) january 2016 (6) december 2015 (12) november 2015 (8) october 2015 (2) september 2015 (3) july 2015 (17) june 2015 (27) may 2015 (12) april 2015 (15) march 2015 (13) february 2015 (11) january 2015 (6) december 2014 (3) november 2014 (4) october 2014 (6) september 2014 (9) august 2014 (1) may 2014 (4) march 2014 (13) february 2014 (28) january 2014 (13) december 2013 (6) november 2013 (14) october 2013 (3) september 2013 (10) august 2013 (4) july 2013 (17) june 2013 (22) may 2013 (12) april 2013 (14) march 2013 (16) february 2013 (17) january 2013 (23) december 2012 (15) november 2012 (16) october 2012 (17) september 2012 (18) august 2012 (23) july 2012 (24) june 2012 (24) may 2012 (12) april 2012 (20) march 2012 (20) february 2012 (33) january 2012 (25) december 2011 (6) november 2011 (11) october 2011 (11) september 2011 (17) august 2011 (26) july 2011 (22) june 2011 (19) may 2011 (15) april 2011 (7) march 2011 (13) february 2011 (2) january 2011 (6) december 2010 (6) november 2010 (6) october 2010 (18) september 2010 (15) august 2010 (8) july 2010 (18) june 2010 (19) may 2010 (24) april 2010 (27) march 2010 (33) february 2010 (30) january 2010 (29) december 2009 (22) november 2009 (26) october 2009 (24) september 2009 (34) august 2009 (35) july 2009 (37) june 2009 (42) may 2009 (29) april 2009 (22) march 2009 (20) february 2009 (27) january 2009 (48) december 2008 (13) november 2008 (30) october 2008 (13) september 2008 (64) august 2008 (13) july 2008 (19) june 2008 (37) may 2008 (6) april 2008 (3) march 2008 (2) january 2008 (2) september 2007 (4) july 2007 (5) april 2007 (1) march 2007 (2) february 2007 (5) january 2007 (5) may 2005 (1) march 2005 (1) february 2005 (2) january 2005 (1) july 2004 (1) january 2004 (1) october 2003 (1) september 2003 (1) august 2003 (1) june 2003 (1) may 2003 (1) february 2003 (3) september 2002 (1) july 2002 (1) june 2002 (1) may 2002 (1) february 2002 (1) september 2001 (1) december 2000 (1) february 1999 (1) january 1998 (1) september 1996 (1) july 1996 (2) december 1994 (1) november 1993 (1) october 1993 (1) december 1992 (1) september 1992 (1) march 1992 (1) october 1991 (2) september 1990 (1) may 1990 (1) october 1989 (1) august 1986 (1) may 1983 (1) april 1980 (2) january 1980 (1) may 1979 (1) june 1974 (1) categories categories select category 2011 (18) art (9) immersion (41) live video (586) livestreams (591) mmos (73) podcast (132) postish (49) rikoo’s quest (nano 09) (17) ryzom (37) ryzompodcast (4) short story (13) uncategorized (2) vanguard (69) vidcast (645) video (633) writing (848) tags 2011 articles beau-hindman beau turkey browser browser based cash shop casual chromebook darkfall f2p free for all free realms free to play ftp game mechanics games gaming google immersion livestream mabinogi massively mmo mmofps mmorpg mmorpgs mmos mobile novel opinion podcast previews pvp role-play roleplay ryzom sandbox soe spouse aggro twitch-tv vanguard vidcast video wow beau hindman's home, proudly powered by wordpress. privacy policy
