developer, still the nanodegree helped me grasp the starting point into front end development. the project are great, they pushed me into searching a lot of topics on the internet, stackoverflow, etc - and i am planning to continue polish them in the next one month. i enjoyed the program and i am planning to take some more nanodegrees - full stack and / or data science topics. zsolt d. i am not entirely new to front end, i have taught myself for the last 3 months as much as i could but i felt that i need that extra push, and the assurance that what ii did was right not just wasting my time, i really enjoyed the first project, because it really felt like it was mine, not an idea from a course copied, can't wait to get to the next project and prove myself that i am on the right path. dimitrios m. i would like to submit a generic comment regarding this and other udacity courses. while i have not really utilised the mentor service, its existence and availability gives the whole nanodegree a different level of quality. without it, the course would feel as a collection of static content - that one can find from a good book. jennifer p. this experience has been great so far. i was nervous to start my first project without any starter code whatsoever but the project guidelines were clear and informative and starting from scratch provided the opportunity for me to be completely creative. pushing students to be bold and brave is important in a new field! belinda c. i'm really excited about this program! i like the combination of videos and written instruction and the projects. constructive feedback: the layout for the curriculum is a little clunky. i wish all the lessons were in a collapsible index on the left hand side. having to go in and out of units and lessons is tedious. carlos k. i am very happy with the program. the instructors are great, the structure of the program is well designed and my mentor is excellent. i think after i graduate from this program, i will continue to enroll in other nanodegree programs. i took web development before but i feel that i am learning a lot. next related nanodegree programs intro to programming nanodegree
