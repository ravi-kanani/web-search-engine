javier r. i wanted to have a better idea of backend web development, after working as a frontend developer and product manager for a while. i enrolled in this course in order to gain this skill to round everything up, and so far it has been a really intense, but also a greatly rewarding experience. i can't tell you how much i've learned, and how better i've become in topics that were a complete black box for me. przemyslaw w. so far, i'm really enjoying the program. i find the way the lessons are set up with the videos are really helpful. i knew python and html coming in, although key concepts that contributed to my success have been learning the mvc model and website file structure. i'm excited to start on my next project. grimberg c. the program is going well. the only need it doesn't match is that in my country and more specifically in my city the languages most wanted are ruby and php for web development. but that's a more personal complaint. besides that it's a wonderful course. ivan c. so far it's has been great. i have reinforced some previous knowledge as well as learned a lot of new things. however i think it would be good if you were a bit more strict with project submissions. feel like i could have done better myself. fred m. the program is so interesting. i have learned new things in sql and database management. my mentor is really helpful and always available. thanks to the udacity team for such a program. i am really excited to learn more new things. next related nanodegree programs front end web developer nanodegree program learn how to build
