since i didn't have any background related to data, i first took udacity's free courses such as python, statistics, sql, linear algebra etc beforehand, and after i felt i got prepared i started this nd. i think it worked. instructions were well organized, and explained with concrete and familiar examples, which helped me grab basic concepts of algorithms. at the end of each section, i had a project, where a lot of works and considerations were required. i searched and read a lot of resources that were sometimes beyond what i had learned in the lecture, which was necessary to complete the projects. i personally loved working on the projects, because reviewers always gave me precious feedback that contains a lot of suggestions and advises for further improvement as well as the words of affirmations and encouragement. it was always inspiring! keeping up with deadlines was quite tough for me actually. i dedicated all my free time to this nd and managed to graduate on schedule. as a reward, i got skills, knowledge, and confidence that i can always learn something new! i believe this is the beginning of my new career in data science. mauricio b. the program is an excellent refresher of ml concepts. i took a ml online class in 2014 (andrew ng's course) and this class was a good way to refresh the basic concepts. i am not sure how i would have performed if this was my first exposure to the themes. the exercises and projects were an excellent resource to familiarize myself with sklearn. i always wanted to become familiar with the library, but never found the focus to learn it. now i feel very confident using it. i also appreciate the very basic refresher on numpy. maybe a good reference could be provided to get more familiar with numpy and plotting techniques in general. i know this is outside the scope of the class, but i still feel not very knowledgeable about plots. manuel f. the mlnd is a great hands-on program with introductions to the key ml/ai techniques. the coding quizzes and projects showcase what's hot in tech, link out to great sources for deeper understanding, and at the same time familiarize the students with the practical and iterative type of work they can expect in ml jobs. i had started this program to enrich my ml understanding and skills, but have enjoyed working on the udacity program so much that i decided to restart my career, moving on from consulting to the tech space. looking forward:) parag a. the lectures were engaging. the projects helped to gain a better understanding of how to apply the concepts learned. the structured and guided questionnaires help a student learn about how to approach a given problem. the slack community was very helpful. the reviewers put real thought into providing constructive feedback and also provide additional links to improve the thought process and content of the projects even further. hope this experience helps me get a job track change into the ml field. pongsasit t. this program are mainly focus on hands-on practices. so learn by doing make me really understand the way how to apply to my work. this course is really proper to data scientist who want to spread the vision and skills to be machine learning engineer. i was a data scientist working in r&d team before, but my new job will be in ml engineer role, so this course really help me understand more in engineering stuffs. (sorry for my grammar) chun yip timothy n. the program is a bit different than what i expect. i was expecting a deeper dive into machine learning algorithms but it is more about the machine learning development cycle. that said, the ai programming with python nanodegree and intro to ml are almost absolute essential prerequisites for this course. next program details program overview - why should i take this program? why should i enroll? as more and more companies are looking to build machine learning products, there is a growing demand for engineers who are able to deploy machine learning models to global audiences. in this program, you’ll learn how to create an end-to-end machine learning product. you’ll deploy machine learning models to a production environment, such as a web application, and evaluate and update that model according to performance metrics. this program is designed to give you the advanced skills you need to become a machine learning engineer. what jobs will this program prepare me for?
