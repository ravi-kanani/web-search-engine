related blogs in 2020 by jamie one of the best ways to connect with other people is through food. everyone loves to eat and experience new culinary adventures. food blogs have given budding chefs, homemakers, and general enthusiasts the opportunity to make their cuisine available to foodies around the world. but it’s not just about the good eats. sharing a recipe lets you share a part of yourself. recipes can be used to showcase your culture, tell a fun story, relive fond memories, and so much more. you, too, can start your very own food blog. you can share your love of cooking and connect with other like-minded individuals who are on the constant lookout for the next great recipe. it’s even possible to turn a small food blog into something bigger. with some dedication, creativity, and the right tools, your blog can become your full-time career. if you’re thinking about taking the jump and diving head-first into the culinary blogosphere and starting a blog, all you have to do is: buy a domain name – the catchy name that all your followers will use to access your blog ( we recommend domain.com – get 25% off ) purchase reliable hosting – where all of your recipes, photos, and text will be stored – ( bluehost is highly recommended for food bloggers ) install wordpress – the tool you’ll use to craft your blog design your blog – create a fun theme and utilize plug-ins to enhance the reading experience – check out mythemeshop for food related themes. craft recipes – share treasured family recipes and new experiments your readers will love promote your blog
