jamie here’s my definitive buyers guide for laptops that are just perfect for programmers and coders of all levels programming can be a lot of fun, but you’ll need a laptop that is designed for your craft. i’m not what you call an expert “programmer” or “coder” as such, but i do know a fair bit of php, html and css. i find that having the right laptop to “code” on, speeds up tasks and processes, which in turn increases productivity. personally i use an alienware aw17r4-7005slv-pus 17″ laptop as it ticks all the boxes for me. i love gaming, building websites and creating infographics. this laptop allows me to do all those things with ease. a laptop for all uses really. and it look so sleek! for optimal results, you’ll want to consider a laptop that has a great combination of execution, performance and power. the problem is that there are hundreds of different laptops to choose from, and although many of them will allow you to code applications, they might not be the best options for your needs. if you’re on a budget, you might find that it’s especially difficult to find the best laptop for programming. to find a laptop that is ideal for your programming needs as a web developer, you must know what to look for. what to look for in a laptop for programming one of the first components that you must consider is the hard drive. many modern laptops are equipped with an ssd drive, which is also known as a solid-state drive. in terms of performance, an ssd is much better than a standard hard drive because it’s much better at accessing stored information. for programming, you’ll want to consider getting a 256gb ssd, but you can also get good results from a 1tb standard drive. when you’re trying to program an application, speed is extremely important. you’ll spend a lot of time sifting through various files and folders. since a ssd can access information very efficiently, you won’t have to spend too much time waiting for files to load. due to the increase in speed, it’s almost always better to choose a smaller ssd over a larger standard drive. whenever you click to open a file on your computer, the hard drive must sift through millions of data bits, which is why it takes a few seconds to load. an ssd stores information much more efficiently than a standard drive, so it’s able to access the information quickly. memory or ram a computer’s memory can be thought of as an extension of its hard drive. the memory is very important because it stores the information that your computer needs to function. when programming, memory is important because all applications use memory to store operating instructions. once you’ve finished writing some code, you’ll need to execute the code as a program, and your computer uses ram to store the directions that tell the program what it should do. you can think of memory like a bucket, and it’s used to hold the instructions for your software programs. memory is also important because it allows you to run several different programs at the same time, and when you have enough memory, the programs will run smoothly. a suitable amount of memory for a programming laptop is about 8gb, but ideally, you should consider getting a model that comes with 16gbs of memory. you must also realize that there are different types of ram. for example, ddr4 ram operates as a higher frequency, so it’s much faster than ddr1 ram. a higher number yields faster speeds. processing power when shopping for the best laptop for programming, you must understand that the cpu is extremely important. like the brain inside of your head, the cpu handles every aspect of functioning that your computer engages in. the processor is like the brain for your computer. the cpu is responsible for handling millions of bits of information, and if your laptop doesn’t have a good cpu, the other components are almost useless. the power of a cpu is measured in gigahertz, but a higher number doesn’t equate to a better processor. a newer processor might have a lower speed in gigahertz than an older processor, but in terms of performance, it could be far superior. if you want the best possible programming experience, consider getting a laptop with an i5 or i7 processor. all processors have cores, and the higher number of cores offers optimal speed and performance. if you don’t want an intel processor, you can get a laptop that has a newer amd processor. comfort features when shopping for a laptop for programming, the specifications are very important, but many consumers don’t look beyond the specs. the process of programming applications involves sitting in front of a computer screen for long periods of time, which is why comfort features are essential. the best laptop for coding should have built-in features for comfort. the keys should be easy to press and comfortable, and the screen should be big enough to reduce eye strain. programming can be difficult with a small screen because you’ll have trouble seeing what you’re doing. what about graphics? a graphics card is what your computer uses to handle games and graphics. for most programming purposes, the graphics card isn’t terribly important. in fact, you should be able to get away with a low-end graphics card. most of the newer cpus, such as the i5 and i7 processors, come with integrated graphics, and although they’re not good for dedicated gaming, they should work well for programming purposes. by going with integrated graphics, you can use the money that you’ll save to get a better processor, which is much more important for coding. if you must get a dedicated graphics card, consider something that has one or two gigabytes of video memory. what about battery life? to determine the importance of battery life, you’ll need to consider where you plan to use your laptop. many programmers find that they’re able to focus better when working in quiet, serene environments. for example, you might be able to perform your best work on a quiet park bench. if you’re going to spend most of your time near an electrical outlet, then battery life shouldn’t be a priority. however, if you think you’ll spend a lot of time programming away from a standard power source, then a laptop with longer battery life is worth considering. shopping for the best laptop for programming should be a fun experience, and by compiling a list of some of the top products, we hope to make your life easier. below, you’ll find a table and reviews for some of the best laptops for coding and programming. laptop image features rating/price jamie's best

2018 at 5:29 pm | reply no msi in the list…your missing some of the best systems on the market ge63vr for example.. mickle pickle december 18, 2017 at 1:25 pm | reply hi jamie (and all others in the know), i’ve recently decided that coding is the name of the game for me, and so i’m off researching my best options. i don’t have a ton of cash but i’ve found a couple that i would really appreciate your opinion(s) to help me decide which of the two you’d recommend. as for coding, obviously html/css and javascript, but i’m also set to learn mysql, php, python and others. the laptops on the radar: 1) msi the gl62 (2gb video) series seems fine, although i’d consider the gp62mvr (3gb video) and the gf62vr (6 gb video), common specs are: 15.6 screen i7 7700hq 16gb ddr4 2400 ram (not sure if necessary to go 32gb) 512-525 ssd m.2 2tb 7200 hdd (i’ll upgrade from the 1tb) or 2) lenovo ideapad y700t-15isk laptop 15.6 uhd multi-touch backlight led screen i7-6700hq 16gb ddr4 1600 1tb 5400 hdd 512gb ssd m.2 pcie i have no idea which would be the better buy, thinking about at least a couple of years worth of service, i don’t play many games so this would really be for coding with the occasional office app. being christmas season the deals are out there, meaning there’s really only a couple of hundred dollars difference between makes and models. i need to make a decision but being new to this game, i could really use and would really appreciate your input and suggestion(s). thanks! jamie february 9, 2018 at 3:02 pm | reply to be totally honest with you, both are very similar. personally the msi pips it for me. vicky morley october 31, 2017 at 7:59 am | reply my son is doing computer games design & development – bsc (hons) degree. he gets support as he is autistic. i want to buy him a laptop that will meet the requirements of his degree. i haven’t a clue! jamie november 1, 2017 at 9:02 am | reply hi vicky any of these will do, but the alienware laptop at the very top is awesome. i use that one. that will probably do the job if he’s going to do a lot of coding for game development. thanks j wes october 8, 2017 at 11:10 am | reply how about 2gen of i3 or i5 processor does it will be ok for programming jamie october 9, 2017 at 10:01 pm | reply for sure! hannah eubanks august 23, 2017 at 1:21 am | reply i’ve been going back and forth between the hp 15 and the hp 14. i’m a freshman undergrad going into my first year of my computer science degree. the 15 sounds really good because of the ssd, which the 14 doesn’t have. the 15 is about $700 on amazon not including tax and on walmart it is about $450 not including tax, but it is sold out and i have no idea when they will restock. the 14 is only about $300 on amazon. the $300 and $450 are more in my price range considering i am a college student. i want the 15 because of all it’s advantages but would the 14 still be a reliable programming and coding laptop? jamie august 23, 2017 at 4:44 pm | reply hey hannah i would go with the 14 if that is what you can afford right now. hopefully in a couple of years you’ll be able to afford the laptop of your dreams once you’ve successfully completed your degree and have a great job in technology. jamie hannah eubanks august 28, 2017 at 3:29 pm thanks so much! sarah carson august 13, 2017 at 5:56 pm | reply thanks for posting this. i’m just starting to learn about coding using the odin project, and i am hoping to get a new laptop soon so i can dig in further and eventually break free from my 9-to-5. as an extremely fresh noob, i found this post very helpful and clear! jamie february 9, 2018 at 3:00 pm | reply that’s great sarah. i wish you all the best. alasdair november 30, 2016 at 9:26 pm | reply not sure why you included a chromebook in this listing for developer laptops. since chrome os is browser-based, your most likely going to be developing in the cloud using services like orion, koding, or cloud 9. also, i just got one of the new dell xps 13’s and it’s perfect for developing. especially since i could get one that came with ubuntu 16.04 installed, which is even better for developing than windows or even newer versions of os x. i’m surprised this was left off of this list as well considering the price range. it has a small 13″ screen but it’s qhd+, touch screen, and can connect up to two 4k monitors. pierre december 11, 2016 at 1:23 pm | reply i’m looking into buying a new pc as well, and have read a lot of different opinions on that dell xps 13 developer edition. especially regrading build quality. what’s your input towards that aspect? gary o'sullivan february 5, 2017 at 3:57 pm | reply yeah chromebook isn’t probably the best programming laptop. you’re limited to web programming platforms. unless, of course, you use a linux emulator. but is it a chromebook anymore then? sunny khan november 29, 2016 at 8:09 pm | reply i=i always use hp. and it works great !!! leave a comment cancel reply
