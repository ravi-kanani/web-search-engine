below is the complete list of the top 10 international destinations for american travelers this summer. paris and london are the only two destinations outside of the americans, and they are (of course) the two most popular destinations in europe. no surprises there. i‚Äôm happy to see islands in the southern caribbean included in this list, such as aruba, because they are the most stunning places to visit in the region (in my humble opinion). for next year, i‚Äôd like to see colombia make the list (another amazing country that is becoming quite popular for americans to visit these days). in regards to mexico, there are travel warnings all over the places for americans to be careful going (and especially after another family was just found killed while on vacation) ‚Äî but places like cancun, where i‚Äôve been twice, are much safer than other regions. as for my personal recommendations for places to visit in summer, 2018 ‚Äî i would say japan, tajikistan and prague ‚Äî all are fascinating places that will be in peak season from may ‚Äì september. *methodology: the data of u.s. travelers‚Äô 2018 summer travel plans was gathered by analyzing the number of travelers that went through the online booking process of airfare and package paths for partners offering allianz global assistance travel to generate itineraries for roundtrip flights departing from us airports during 5/28/2018 ‚Äì 9/3/2018 for trips between 5-8 days in length. disclaimer: i am a partner with allianz and receive financial compensation from them. that being said, this post was written by me and all opinions are mine. about latest posts drew binsky a graduate from the university of wisconsin-madison, drew binsky has visited 190+ countries since 2012.he first caught the travel bug while studying abroad in prague, then taught english in korea, and now he's on a mission to visit every country on earth.follow his journey on youtube & instagram @drewbinsky üôÇ latest posts by drew binsky (see all) my 2018 recap: 35 new countries visited - january 3, 2019 iran is not what you think!!
