their own opinions. and that’s ok. personally, my favorite blogs about travel blend a difficult-to-achieve combination of good writing, great photography, helpful advice, and smart webdesign. they might not all be the most popular blogs, but they get me excited to discover and learn about new places. so in no particular order, below you’ll find my favorite travel blogs for 2020. follow them if you’d like to escape from reality for a while during your work break — and maybe get inspired for your next trip in the process! 1. maptia travel blog maptia is a collaborative project with a diverse group of photographers, writers, adventurers, and conservationists, who bring their readers a world of inspiring and thought-provoking stories. they are a volunteer-run travel blog spending hundreds of hours over the past 4 years to self-publish impactful travel stories in an independent, ad-free environment. current favorite post: life among the trees 2. roads & kingdoms roads & kingdoms’ message is simple: the more you know, the better you travel. r&k use talented local journalists, deep storytelling, and the good things in life —- food, music, booze — to inform and inspire about destinations around the globe. winners of a 2018 primetime emmy, a 2019 national magazine award and the 2017 james beard publication of the year award. current favorite post: the bootleggers of madagascar 3. notes from the road by road, by kayak, by seaplane and most of all on foot, erik gauger tackles the themes of city and country in the modern world on his blog notes from the road. erik shares “the messy truth of travel, told by a regular guy.” his photography and writing are some of the best i’ve seen online from an independent travel blog. you’ll get lost for hours reading his stories. current favorite post: sancti spiritus & the psychedelic flyer 4. uncornered market originally from the united states, daniel noll and audrey scott are the husband-and-wife storytelling team behind uncornered market. through their stories, and speaking about sustainable tourism, they are creating a movement of travelers who live at the intersection of adventure, deep travel and life experiences. more than 90 countries later, they are still going… and still married. current favorite post: how to be a good global traveler 5. atlas & boots atlas & boots is an outdoor travel blog covering thrilling activities in far-flung places be it swimming with whales in tonga or trekking volcanoes in vanuatu. although peter watson and kia abdullah started on opposite ends of the outdoor spectrum, over the years they drew each other towards the middle; to what they describe as outdoorsy-ish. current favorite post: a walk among giants in the karakoram 6. wandering earl in 1999, derek left the united states for a three-month, post-graduation trip to asia. the idea was to backpack around thailand, cambodia and vietnam and then return home. however that adventure is still going on today. it’s now been over 18 years of nonstop travel and derek has visited 100+ countries, sharing his experiences & thoughts on a wonderful travel blog called wandering earl. current favorite post: us customs found a bullet in my pocket 7. nomadic matt growing up in boston, matt didn’t take his first overseas trip until he was 23, but he is certainly making up for it now. as a new york times best-selling author of how to travel the world on $50 a day and founder of one of the biggest travel blogs online, nomadic matt has helped millions of people to travel more with his useful tips and advice. i’ve been reading his blog for years! current favorite post: is flying really bad for the environment? 8. i am aileen aileen adalid is a filipina travel blogger behind the cool site i am aileen. along with a wonderful design and great photos, she shares helpful tips from her travels around the world, as well as advice for becoming a digital nomad (she sells custom gear on amazon). i particularly love her content from japan and antarctica. current favorite post: exploring kyoto with the last samurai 9. anywhere we roam mark and paul are always looking for answers. whether discussing politics with locals in a city bar, understanding unusual rock formations in spectacular scenery or working out the meaning of life in an obscure gallery in the middle east. their questions drive their passion for independent travel and invoke their curiosity to see the world through the eyes of locals — and sharing it with you. current favorite post: hiking cappadocia: three favorite walks 10. bucketlistly travel blog with over 65+ countries knocked off his own bucket list, pete is an inspiration, traveling for 7 years, going from one country to another while working on bucketlistly blog and many other business ventures. he is a travel filmmaker, a photographer, a digital nomad, a design freelancer, and a solo traveler, telling his travel stories through a combination of award-winning travel videos, gorgeous photography and immersive writing all in one. current favorite post: traveling on a third-world passport 11. lost with purpose alex travels around the world, “alternating between swashbuckling skullduggery and gallant gallivanting depending on the alignment of the stars”. originally from the united states, she decided to quit her desk job to travel the world for a while, living out of a backpack, wandering aimlessly, and often getting lost with a purpose. her current trajectory is taking her completely off the beaten path, with stories from destinations like afghanistan, pakistan, and iran. current favorite post: my self-exile to lake baikal, siberia 12. against the compass you’re probably starting to see a pattern in my favorite blogs! i love to follow people who are going against the grain, taking on destinations that don’t get as much love as others do. against the compass is exactly that. it is an alternative travel blog, which aims to help you to travel to the most unusual and off the beaten track destinations. joan works hard to break stereotypes and inspire you to get out of the comfort zone. current favorite post: how to visit chernobyl responsibly 13. the travel episodes expect inspiring travel reports by a selection of different authors as they recount their adventures using text, film and photography. unlike many other travel blogs, the focus of this website is on the story, with none of the other distracting elements you find on many blogs. it encourages readers to scroll and control the pace of the story themselves. it’s incredible to see how johannes klaus has put together this engaging site for telling great travel stories, and it’s easy to get lost for hours reading. current favorite post: moab utah: where adventure begins 14. sidetracked magazine sidetracked is a wonderful tri-annual adventure travel magazine and online journal that features a collection of personal stories of adventure travel, exploration, journeys and expeditions from different writers. the concept is simple: to capture the emotion and experience of adventure and expeditions throughout the world… and of course to inspire you to head out on your own adventures too. current favorite post: the draw of the faroes 15. along dusty roads it all changed for andrew and emily on a rain-soaked and gin-fueled evening in east london back in 2014, when they decided to make life more interesting and take a chance on doing what they love – embracing travel and photography. fast forward a year later and they were on a one-way flight to mexico with several cameras, a couple of laptops and enough money to last 2 years. since then, quite a lot has changed, but their approach to travel and adventure has stayed the same, and i always love reading their blog. current favorite post: an african dream travel blog directory list (2020) it doesn’t matter if you’re interested in budget travel, luxury travel,
