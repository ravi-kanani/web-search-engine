lara durgavich (@tinkeringprim8) march 24, 2020 in what i think is the most interesting battle of the night, the cuttlefish faces off against the thylacine. these two are nearly opposites and it‚Äôs

22, 2020 by rambling redshirt posted in daily ramble 1 comment back in november, i kicked off a five game challenge that was quite a bit of fun. i focused on five plus one games, and instead of locking into a set of games for a year, i tried to tackle it based on my usual planning timeframe ‚Äì 12 weeks. i think i stuck with the games pretty well, but towards the end of the time period, things started to break down. now, with lockdowns in place, viruses in on every surface, and a crackdown on in-person interaction, i think it might be the perfect time to revisit the experiment. a look back at november‚Äôs games last year, i followed in the footsteps of some of my favorite bloggers (the gaming diaries, endgame viable, time to loot, princess in a castle, contains moderate peril) and tried out a five game challenge. it actually ended up being a 5+1 challenge since i had just purchased a game and didn‚Äôt want to wait three months to try it out. the five games i selected were the secret world, civilization vi, lord of the rings online, star wars: the old republic, the witcher iii, and my plus one was moons of madness. over the next few posts, i want to cover my thoughts on my experience in these games during the challenge, but today i wanted to move ahead into another challenge. plus two even before the china flu lockdown, i had been working on another experiment in the same genre as the five plus one challenge i gave myself last year. this turned into a five plus two challenge. now i know the original challenge was for the five games you would want to have if you were trapped on a desert island. i perverted that last time around with my 5+1 and am doing so again with 5+2, but i just can‚Äôt seem to stick with the conventional five games. this time around, i picked out four new games and 3 i had in my last experiment. i looked at lord of the rings online, the secret world, and the witcher iii from last time. i enjoyed each of these games in the previous few months, and since they are all pretty extensive and i had just cracked the surface, i figured i could easily find more to do in each of them during the next 12 weeks. the other set of games i wanted to add this time around were total war: three kingdoms, slay the spire, nioh, and greedfall. new additions with the new games i picked, i kinda wanted to ensure a breadth of diversity, but i also saw that there was at least one sequel coming out that i wanted to get ready for. apparently, nioh is gonna have a sequel soon, and i‚Äôm excited to revisit this world and get some more enjoyment out of the ‚Äúdark souls‚Äù type of gameplay. it was a fun game back when it came out, but i never got all the way through. hopefully, i‚Äôll be able to at least get to where i was last time during this 12 week test. total war: three kingdoms is a current instance of a long-running game series that i have always wanted to play. i‚Äôve bought a bunch of the versions on steam over the years but have yet to dip my toe into the worlds they provide. this time will be the charm as i am dedicating myself to getting this one going. slay the spire is a game i purchased on steam a while ago and just haven‚Äôt given a chance to. i‚Äôve heard all kinds of good things about the game and recently have heard a couple of gamers on podcasts talking about completing the game. i‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what this game is all about. finally, the last game is greedfall, which was specifically something i heard about from the tales of the aggronaut and the podcast he runs. he speaks pretty highly about this game, so i am looking forward to seeing how this squares up with my gaming tastes. it‚Äôs a wrap so there are the five plus two games i‚Äôm focusing (or at least trying to focus) on during this current 12 weeks. i‚Äôll be going over my progress as the weeks go on, and with the china flu lockdown in place, i may have more of an opportunity to get some gaming in the near future. last time around, at the 9‚Äì10 week point, i started jumping around to other games, so hopefully this time i‚Äôll be more dedicated. ramble 2020.01.30 | revisiting my five games civilization vi gaming
