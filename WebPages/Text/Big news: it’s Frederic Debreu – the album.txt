menu home news frederic debreu sex and bowls english chansons jonnyb contact big news: it’s frederic debreu – the album posted on november 22, 2017november 23, 2017 by alex i’m over the moon – and still a bit gobsmacked – to announce the release of the very first cd of frederic debreu’s songs. that’s eleven selected works from the great master himself, translated into english, performed and produced by the artists behind jake thackray’s album of ‘lost songs’. it's fronted by the terrific john watterson, who recorded the vocals in time out from his never-ending uk tour of festivals and folk clubs. i penned lyrics for nine of the songs (and very occasionally donned my musician’s hat during the production stage to send helpful email feedback like ‘why don’t you make that first line of the chorus go sort of om-tee-tom-tee-tooo rather than om-pom-diddle-i-pom?’ – i really have no idea how the performers would have managed without my astute musical nous.) the end result is an imagining of what debreu might have sounded like in translation, as recorded in the present day and performed by british artists. a concept album based on the book, i suppose? the very first fictitious french chansonnier english-yorkshire-norfolk concept album. it’s an odd experience, seeing other people take forward a vision of yours. but i’ve been watching in utter delight as things came to fruition. paul thompson – the man behind the melodies and guitar playing – is steeped in french chanson; incredibly knowledgeable about the form, he took the idea, and ran with it. a couple of us book reviewers had previously mentioned that they had to google to see if debreu was ‘real’ – i absolutely cherished reading that, and can now answer ‘yes’, in that fred’s taken on a life independent of me. and i am as flattered as hell that these proper musicians thought enough of the book to think: ‘aha! we could develop an album based on this, and sell and perform it alongside the jake thackray stuff!’ that is quite something to me, and it would be ridiculous and dishonest to pretend to be all cool about it. find out about the album here; there's a small youtube sampler of the music, and the lyrics are on the site if you're interested. an ideal christmas gift? see what you think. more info... click to share on twitter (opens in new window) click to share on facebook (opens in new window) click to share on reddit (opens in new window) related post navigation school visit, or ‘i become a failed bear.’ frédéric debreu: live in cheshire get news via email very occasional updates from me. no spam. your email subscribe recent news i have a new privacy policy!!! frédéric debreu: live in cheshire big news: it’s frederic debreu – the album school visit, or ‘i become a failed bear.’ a summary of events. on leonard cohen, and music before words the lost will and testament of jake thackray “so she slammed the tailgate, but unfortunately that thrust the canoe forwards through the windscreen…” my latest book "in the grand tradition of british comic novels..." click the image to find out more. the jonnyb archives the jonnyb archives select month may 2018 (1) january 2018 (1) november 2017 (1) june 2017 (1) march 2017 (1) november 2016 (1) october 2016 (1) september 2016 (1) august 2016 (2) july 2016 (1) june 2016 (1) may 2016 (2) april 2016 (6) march 2016 (3) february 2016 (1) january 2016 (3) december 2015 (1) october 2014 (1) may 2014 (1) july 2013 (1) may 2013 (1) april 2013 (3) march 2012 (1) february 2012 (1) january 2012 (2) december 2011 (2) november 2011 (3) september 2011 (2) august 2011 (2) july 2011 (1) june 2011 (2) may 2011 (3) march 2011 (3) february 2011 (3) january 2011 (3) december 2010 (4) november 2010 (5) october 2010 (6) september 2010 (4) august 2010 (5) july 2010 (5) june 2010 (5) may 2010 (4) april 2010 (5) march 2010 (9) february 2010 (5) january 2010 (4) december 2009 (6) november 2009 (8) october 2009 (4) september 2009 (6) august 2009 (6) july 2009 (5) june 2009 (6) may 2009 (7) april 2009 (5) march 2009 (7) february 2009 (4) january 2009 (4) december 2008 (8) november 2008 (5) october 2008 (6) september 2008 (7) august 2008 (4) july 2008 (6) june 2008 (7) may 2008 (8) april 2008 (8) march 2008 (8) february 2008 (9) january 2008 (9) december 2007 (8) november 2007 (10) october 2007 (13) september 2007 (10) august 2007 (8) july 2007 (10) june 2007 (6) may 2007 (11) april 2007 (9) march 2007 (9) february 2007 (9) january 2007 (12) december 2006 (9) november 2006 (11) october 2006 (10) september 2006 (11) august 2006 (12) july 2006 (13) june 2006 (12) may 2006 (15) april 2006 (11) march 2006 (13) february 2006 (9) january 2006 (12) december 2005 (15) november 2005 (15) october 2005 (18) september 2005 (22) august 2005 (16) july 2005 (18) june 2005 (17) may 2005 (16) april 2005 (15) march 2005 (22) february 2005 (13) january 2005 (18) december 2004 (19) november 2004 (19) october 2004 (18) september 2004 (22) august 2004 (15) july 2004 (22) june 2004 (22) may 2004 (19) april 2004 (19) march 2004 (17) february 2004 (4) january 2004 (1) copyright (c) 2017 by alex marsh
