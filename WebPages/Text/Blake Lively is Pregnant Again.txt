hecklerspray grown up gossip & internet villainy blake lively is pregnant again may 3rd, 2019 by krysta fitzpatrick damn, look who’s back? after what seemed like a 10 year hiatus, ya girl is back! yep, that’s right. i’m writing a shitty celebrity gossip blog, and blake lively is pregnant again! some things never change. it seems like every time i turn around ryan reynolds has knocked blake lively up again. i’m pretty sure this is like their 7th kid (ok, it’ll be their third). there have literally been no whispers about blake being pregnant for a third time, then she shows up at the detective pikachu premiere super pregnant. i mean, maybe she’s kylie jenner level stealthy, or maybe she’s only like three months pregnant and just popped last week. i mean, visibly she looks 5-6 months pregnant, but this is her third kid. i’ve heard by the third kid you look 9 months pregnant by the time you hit your 5th month, so home girl could really be like 12 weeks along, who knows? blake and ryan already have two painfully cute daughters, james, 4, and inez, 2, and i’m sure this baby will be equally stunning because, i mean, come on, look at these people! blake once joked in an interview years ago that her and ryan would probably have a big family because they were “breeders” and apparently she was serious about that. leave a comment cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * notify me of new posts by email. a mediocre rundown of the 2019 oscars so the jodyn and tristan thing is probably true tristan thompson allegedly cheats on khloe kardashian with jordyn woods lil xan is having a kid and i can't deal with that katy perry and orlando bloom are engaged blogroll rumorfix hecklerspray.com copyright © 2019 · · terms · privacy · dmca · contact
