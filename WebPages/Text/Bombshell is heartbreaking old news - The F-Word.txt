carlson has less internal conflict and perhaps more clarity in how she handles herself so, although she is sympathetic, she is more straightforward compared to kelly and pospisil. carlson is the first to sue roger ailes for sexual harassment, but she’s warned that without testimonies of fellow fox news workers her case does not stand a chance. she continues forward fearlessly, regardless of the consequences. carlson’s all-female team at fox news includes margot robbie’s fictional character of kayla pospisil. her character stands as a symbol for all the young anchors who were victims of the abuse at the time, while still protecting their real identities. pospisil is young and ambitious, ready to make the world her own, and is desperate to be the face of young republicans for fox news. her character represents some of the most vulnerable people in the workplace. roach manages to make the scenes of her abuse as uncomfortable as physically possible, having ailes’ grunts of approval and pospisil’s short breath the only thing the audience can hear. the camera focuses not on the young reporter’s dress, but on her teary-eyed face in complete shock. to see a predator so comfortably taking advantage of someone so vulnerable and alone is a painful reminder of the stories behind #metoo. as we see all at fox news rallying behind ailes following gretchen carlson’s allegations, kelly faces criticism and exclusion for not supporting ailes along with everyone else. her conflicting feelings about whether to back carlson in her claims is compelling; knowing that it would be the catalyst needed to bring all the victims justice. having spent her career putting herself first, kelly is faced with a decision which would affect more than just her. eventually she supports carlson with her allegations. as a consequence, floods of current and former fox employees come forth with their allegations – if megyn kelly can do it, so can they. to see these women’s unity being the ‘bombshell’ that brought their abuser down is not just empowering, but a relief. bombshell’s biggest achievement is forcing the audience to empathise with the isolation and loneliness that comes with battling workplace harassment and abuse. carlson is ridiculed for leading a losing fight, pospisil is rejected by her friend when reaching out for help and kelly stays silent for her own protection. anybody, regardless of political opinion or career can fall victim to sexual assault. but the film reminds us that supporting other women, listening to other women and being there for other women is the one thing that we can do to help each other. regardless, bombshell still leaves a sour taste in your mouth – as the post-credits remind us fox paid $50 million in compensation to the victims but offered $65 million to ailes. in case it wasn’t clear, the fight for equal treatment in the workplace is far from over. images courtesy of hilary bronwyn gayle via lionsgate. image description: 1. a close up of the film’s poster, which portrays the overlapping faces of the three lead actresses and plays on their similarities, such as blue eyes and bleached blonde hair. 2. charlize theron as megyn kelly. she sits behind a fox news desk. she’s elegant and composed. a hint of a smile on her face. there’s a lit cityscape in the background. 3. the fox news offices. all the employees appear to be confused and shook. in the foreground are nicole kidman as carlson and margot robbie as pospisil. #metoobombshellcinemafilmsexual harassment ashleigh riseley ashleigh riseley is a politics & international relations student. she enjoys applying her research and knowledge to pop culture, with a passion for film related posts queen and slim is no bonnie and clyde ashleigh riseley22 march 2020 abuse is the real invisible monster alessia galatini1 march 2020 leave a reply cancel reply you must be logged in to post a comment. compilation ©2001-2018 the f-word. all rights reserved. | built by agilityweb
