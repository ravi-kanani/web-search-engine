thank you for sharing! i guess i am anxious when i‚Äôm in fixing mode. i never really thought of myself as anxious. but there‚Äôs definitely a fear of failing and feeling uncomfortable feelings. like my biggest fear is of feeling things that could lead to me feeling down. i do feel exhausted. this makes so much sense. blessings to you! march 23, 2020 at 2:44 pm #344822 anita participant dear fiest: if you find ways to lessen your anxiety on a regular basis, you will experiencing lasting energy that will keep you going and going. when i participated in my first quality psychotherapy, my therapist at the time had me listen to a series of mindfulness guided meditations by mark williams, as a way to lessen my anxiety. you may want to try that or some other guided meditations that will work for you, as a start. anita march 23, 2020 at 3:21 pm #344834 fiest participant i will do this! focus on how i use my energy‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs something i never thought of. thank you again! march 23, 2020 at 3:30 pm #344842 anita participant you are welcome, fiest. please let me know how the mindfulness guided meditation (or some other calming guided meditation) works for you. anita march 24, 2020 at 5:40 pm #345212 fiest participant today i noticed how excited and wound up i get when i communicate with people via text. and i noticed my energy usage doing that. that lead me to realized that i kind of thrive on this anxious weird adrenaline-like energy. it makes me excited and friendly, but also kind of crazy. was wondering if i‚Äôm maybe kind of addicted to this state. today i feel really really good. i feel less needy and worried. and i‚Äôve been mindful of balancing my energy all day. last night i spent time watching my thoughts, sort of like a self-guided mindfulness meditation. it had been a while since i had just laid in bed, doing nothing. no reading, no fixing. i came to a realization about my relationships today, which i wanted to post a question about in the forums for feedback. thank you again! üôÇ march 24, 2020 at 7:12 pm #345238 anita participant dear fiest: you are welcome. when you do ‚Äúthrive on this anxious weird adrenaline-like energy‚Äù, feeling ‚Äúexcited and friendly.. feel really really good‚Äù- it is not anxiety that you are experiencing, it is joy! fear/ anxiety is a kind of excitement that feels bad; joy is a kind of excitement that feels good. anita march 25, 2020 at 1:09 pm #345372 peter participant hi fiest you seem to have a good handle on how to proceed. i just wanted to add that most people assume they understand what hope is and how to hope. more often then not it gets entangled with existential angst, ego, control, desire for certainty, fear of uncertainty, desire to have life conform to our demands of how it ‚Äòshould‚Äô be‚Ä¶ hope confuse as a kind of passive wishing.. waiting for that ‚Äòsomething‚Äô other then what it is. hope is paradoxical. it is neither passive waiting nor is it unrealistic forcing of circumstances. hope is like the crouched tiger, which will jump only when the moment for jumping has come. to hope means to be ready at every moment for that which is not yet born, yet hope is not desperate. those who hope unskillfully settle down for self comfort (verses self care) or for violence; those whose hope is skillful see and cherish all signs of new life and are ready every moment to help the birth of that which is ready to be born. to hope is a state of being, an inner readiness. ‚Äúand yet it would not be wrong to say that the tree hopes for the sunlight and expresses this hope by twisting its trunk toward the sun‚Äù ‚Äì erich fromm the practice of hope is a art.. perhaps related to the idea of zen‚Äôs doing by not doing‚Ä¶ keeping ones eyes open while continuing to engage with life. this reply was modified 2 days, 1 hour ago by peter. author posts viewing 9 posts - 1 through 9 (of 9 total) you must be logged in to reply to this topic. please log in or register. disclaimer this site is not intended to provide and does not constitute medical, legal, or other professional advice. the content on tiny buddha is designed to support, not replace, medical or psychiatric treatment. please seek professional care if you believe you may have a condition. before using the site, please read our privacy policy and terms of use. click to opt-out of google analytics tracking. who runs tiny buddha? though i run this site, it is not mine. it's ours. it's not about me. it's about us. your stories and your wisdom are just as meaningful as mine. click here to read more. get more tiny buddha twitter facebook youtube rss feed credits & copyright hosting by presslabs. design by joshua denney. copyright ¬© 2019 tiny buddha, llc think web strategy back to top
