(very), it turns out. things like bribing them with dog-sweets to stop them misbehaving, which turned out to mean you are rewarding them with dog-sweets for misbehaving. guess what the dogs continued to do. until the english version of the dog whisperer started working his dog-magic. while watching that, i was rootling through tweets i’ve been saving, to see if any were deserving of the immortality that comes with being mentioned here at bmnb. these ones seemed good, and they chimed in rather nicely with that dog show i was also one-third-attending to. clarissa: currently experiencing the usual reward for demonstrating competence at work. … graeme: more work? clarissa: bingo. graeme: well i hope you learned from your mistake! well, clarissa is not a dog, so maybe not. maybe she was rewarded for the more work that she did. but if not … hey, what with all this coronavirus disruption, maybe clarissa has managed to hang on to her job. posted on friday 27 march 2020friday 27 march 2020 categories: categories business, current events, how the mind works, social media, society leave a comment photos are back! (again) i know, you’ve heard this before. here’s hoping it lasts this time. i celebrate with this photo, taken in the south of france, perpignan i think, nearly fifteen years ago in june 2005: i love that, though i say it myself, and although (among another thing) it’s of myself, several times over. those frenchies do love their motorbikes. posted on thursday 26 march 2020friday 27 march 2020 categories: categories computer graphics, france, my photographs, technology, this blog, travel leave a comment john lewis gaddis on the failure of the spanish armada stephen davies, seeking to explain europe’s technological and economic breakthrough into modernity, and john lewis gaddis reflecting on the emergence of the usa as the world’s current superpower, both identify the defeat of the spanish armada as a key moment. davies says that the failure of catholic spain to subdue protestant england meant that europe, unlike all the other great civilisations of the world, remained disunited and hence internally competitive. and gaddis argues, in his book on grand strategy, argues, at the beginning of his chapter entitled “new worlds” (pp. 151-152) that the defeat of the armada “made possible the creation of the united states” as we now know it: it’s not counterfactual to claim that the real events of 1588 in the english channel echoed loudly and long enough “to shake a hemisphere.” the previous century had seen the portuguese and the spanish, neither hitherto seismically significant, exploiting a new understanding of ships, sails, winds, and currents to explore and conquer immensities of strange new things.’ “non sufficit orbis,” philip ii’s motto for his iberian kingdoms and the empire they’d acquired, was eloquently apt: eurasia, the old world into which all earlier empires had fit, had indeed not been enough. as the armada left lisbon that summer, few from whom it faded from sight would have anticipated anything other than enduring catholic monarchies throughout what had become known as america. for how could god not be on the side of the christian kingdoms of castile and aragon that had, in the single year 1492, expelled their muslim neighbors, ejected their jews, and almost as an aside expanded the size of the earth? or, in the year that followed, gained title to the new territories, together with portugal, by papal edict? or, as spain, required only three years to conquer mexico and not many more to control peru, thereby ensuring apparently endless supplies of gold and silver? or, using these riches, imposed administrative and even architectural uniformity on two unfamiliar continents? or mapped out, for their diverse inhabitants, a single path to salvation? accomplishments on this scale require more than self-confidence: they presume knowledge of, and correspondence with, god’s will. two hundred and thirty-five years after the armada sailed, however, a staunchly protestant statesman, in the swampy new capital of a secular state, was drafting an equally presumptuous proclamation for his republican sovereign: “that the american continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european powers.” when secretary of state john quincy adams made the monroe doctrine a motto for the “united states of america” in 1823, that country lacked the means of securing the “new world” against its “old” masters. it had the self-confidence, though, of spain in its prime, and that, adams saw, would suffice. “the failure of the spanish armada,” geoffrey parker has argued, “laid the american continent open to invasion and colonization by northern europeans, and thus made possible the creation of the united states.” if that’s right, then the future pivoted on a single evening – august 7, 1588 – owing to a favorable wind, a clever lord admiral, and a few fiery ships. had he succeeded, philip would have required elizabeth to end all english voyages to america.’ but from the moment his captains cut their anchor cables, spain began a slow decline, and a new world order its gradual ascendancy. this book (which i have just ordered from amazon) presumably being one of the places where geoffrey parker (a new name to me) makes this argument. posted on thursday 26 march 2020 categories: categories bits from books, books, europe, history, religion, usa, war leave a comment a twenty-first century moment central to understanding it is that i still don’t understand it. okay, so earlier this evening my phone rang. i picked it up, and said, to some suspiciously silent silence, “hello”. no answer. “hello”. no answer. down goes the phone. who was that? oh well. if this had been the twentieth century, this would have been a “crossed line”. but, i thought, this is not the twentieth century. this is the twenty-first century. do we still have crossed lines? i rather think not. oh well. a bit later, the phone rings again, and it’s goddaughter 2. i know this because i recognise her voice. (my phone has no idea who’s ringing.) i asked: did you ring earlier? no. well, i said “hello” and “hello” to somebody, but heard nothing back. she said, in an “omg” voice: oh my god. i was just talking to my dad, she said. and he said he heard you talking, she said. while we were talking, she said, on some twenty first century computer programme the name of which i (as in: not gd2 – as in: i) forget, but which i (ditto) surmise enables third parties to join in the conversation, so you can have a group chat. in among the talk between gd2 and gd2’s dad, the phrase “ring brian” was used, for some reason i didn’t catch and still don’t understand (see above). so, the programme promptly rang brian, aka me. but i don’t have the programme on my twentieth century telephone, so i could hear nothing. but gd2’s dad heard me saying “hello” “hello”. later, gd2’s dad’s phone rang me again, and i answered, “hello” “hello” etc, and a strange young man’s voice came on saying what must have been “who are you?”, while i was busy saying “who are you?” gds’s dad’s phone had rung gd2’s dad too, helpfully putting us in touch, given that it had failed last time. gd2’s brother aka gd2’s dad’s son answered at that end, which make the whole situation really clear, to both of us. not. oh well. gd2’s dad and i had a chat, because we are both polite and could neither of us just say: but i wasn’t trying to talk to you. this must be what they call artificial intelligence. please understand (see above about how i don’t actually understand) that the above description is only my guess about what was really happening. posted on wednesday 25 march 2020thursday 26 march 2020 categories: categories friends, getting old, history, society, software, technology leave a comment my favourite coronavirus tweet so far robert colvile: on of the few positives of this godawful epidemic – at least they might cancel the hundred. read my opinions about this deranged contrivance here. i guess the idea is that it’s existing cricket fans who put off all those new cricket fans just bursting to attend cricket games, if only those other fans would disappear. so, devise a cricket competition so stupid that all existing cricket fans are disgusted and don’t show up. will all the kool kids then turn up in their droves? or, will nobody care? i believe: the latter. posted on tuesday 24 march 2020tuesday 24 march 2020 categories: categories business, quote unquote, sport leave a comment quota silliness pc dave wise: is it pronounced shrewsbury or shrewsbury? i asked [the] shrewsbury cops but they told me it could be either … or either. tomatoes tomatoes potatoes potatoes. seriously, i thought it was shrows-bury. but the football commentators all call it as spelt. which is surely very un-english. i still treasure the moment when an american asked me where lie sester square was. it’s been a busy day. still getting that self-isolation thing organised. posted on monday 23 march 2020 categories: categories comedy, current events, language, social media leave a comment locomotive with viewing gallery i tried to load the photo here, but it seems that i am once again suffering from photo loading difficulties. the photo in question is a of an historical (1910) steam locomotive with a carriage piggy-backing on it. it’s not a real carriage even though it looks like one from the outside, because slap in the middle of it, unless i am much mistaken, there is a regular locomotive type boiler. all you can do is stand beside the boiler and look out through the windows. would that this blog was a similarly effective viewing gallery. i hope that this will soon be sorted. again. posted on sunday 22 march 2020sunday 22 march 2020 categories: categories computer graphics, history, this blog, transport leave a comment bmnbqotd emily yoffe: after 25 years of marriage, my husband and i are getting to know each other with a depth that is best avoided. the comments vary, from the laughter of recognition to the usual twitter denunciation of strangers on the basis of wildly insufficient evidence. was she just joking? very possibly. lots of fine marriages seem to work all the better for them not spending all day together. i’m okay. my new tabletop freezer just arrived this morning. soon, i will start getting to know it in depth. posted on saturday 21 march 2020sunday 22 march 2020 categories: categories family, food and drink, quote unquote, social media, technology leave a comment bird photos sublime (although not for the unfortunate fish): ridiculous (although the ducks don’t seem to mind much): i found the sublime one by first admiring this amazing photo of a mosquito’s foot at mick hartley’s blog. i followed the link there (and i recommend you do this also), and then wandered (ditto). if you like wild and wonderful creatures, that is. (many of of them are of course not wild at all.) posted on friday 20 march 2020 categories: categories australasia, food and drink, other creatures leave a comment man carries tired boy i can’t now remember when photoing other people’s children, even photoing them completely by mistake while photoing something else entirely, became something you couldn’t and wouldn’t ever do. but it must have been some time in the noughts, and definitely well before july 2014, when i photoed this photo: but i don’t think there’s any harm in showing this photo. no faces are at all visible, let alone recognisable. and of course faces are not the point of this photo, the view of the top of the kid’s head being exactly what makes it work so well. posted on thursday 19 march 2020saturday 21 march 2020 categories: categories london, my photographs, society leave a comment posts navigation page 1 page 2 … page 114 next page proudly powered by wordpress
