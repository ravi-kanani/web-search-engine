some strains of the bug, however, are not so fine. should one of these strains of e coli get into our systems, typically via the ingestion of contaminated water or food, those stricken by the bug can suffer symptoms ranging fa quick bout of the trots to serious issues with symptoms including severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. so, maybe serve up a kale, iceberg or coleslaw salad this year, instead. it'll give everyone gathered around your table one more reason to be thankful. image via wikipedia commons read the rest share / tweet / 44 comments bad things / cdc / e. coli / luttuce be thankful / romaine lettuce / thanksgiving / today in vomit seamus bellamy / 12:35 pm mon, sep 10, 2018 two more planes full of sick people land in the united states bringing the zombie apocalypse one step closer you may have heard that an emirates flight ek 203 was quarantined by the center for disease control at john f. kennedy airport immediately after landing earlier this week. at first, it was crazy town: abc news reported that 100 people on the flight were sick with fevers and uncontrollable coughing. vanilla ice was on board! but as the cdc and the nypd began to get a handle on what was going on, things felt a little less scary. only 10 people in total--maybe--were sick. only 11 of the 100 sick individuals were taken to the hospital. more than half of the passengers were found to be healthy. those who were healthy enough to forgo medical attention were released to go about their lives, provided they reported any worsening systems to the cdc. also, vanilla ice is just fine. according to the cdc, all signs point to the illness being a flu. knowing this doesn't make me feel any better about the fact that two more planes landing in the united states were placed under heavy scrutiny by health officials. from the verge: both of today’s flights were on american airlines: one from munich and another from paris. they landed at philadelphia international airport with about a dozen people in total on board who felt sick, according to a statement from the airport. that in itself is not that unusual because of the dry air and the prevalence of cat dander on planes, allen parmet, an aerospace medicine expert, told the verge in an interview yesterday: “it’s actually pretty common to have somebody coughing in a plane.” read the rest share / tweet / 35 comments air travel / cdc / get a flu shot / zombie flu / zombies cory doctorow / 9:28 am wed, jan 31, 2018 cdc chief brenda fitzgerald quits after outed for buying into a tobacco company brenda fitzgerald was donald trump's director of the centers for disease control and prevention, charged with reducing smoking among americans and doing work that directly affected the financial fortunes of tobacco companies when she bought a stake in japan tobacco. read the rest share / tweet / 24 comments brenda fitzgerald / business / cdc / conflict of interest / corruption / regulatory capture / trumpism cory doctorow / 8:20 am sat, dec 16, 2017 the cdc is why you and your loved ones aren't dead. trump just banned them from using the phrase "science-based." epidemiology is intrinsically at odds with right-wing ideology: the idea that all humans have a shared microbial and viral destiny, one that entwines the poorest and richest among us, which cannot be severed by the highest walls or all the private security in the world is a significant barrier to anyone who dreams of going galt and declaring themselves to be responsible only to themselves -- there is no ayn rand novel thick enough to stop you from getting antibiotic resistant tb. read the rest share / tweet / 130 comments cdc / epidemiology has a well-known left-wing bias / quackspeak / reality-based community / rightspeak / science / trump / trumpism / wishful thinking andrea james / 6:02 am fri, apr 10, 2015 the 17 states where guns kill more people than cars do motor vehicle deaths continue to drop in the us this century. firearm deaths continue to rise. if the cdc's wisqars data holds its path since 2013, guns will soon be america's top killing machine. the 17 states (and one district) in order are: read the rest share / tweet / 39 comments cars / cdc / gun / gun policy / guns / violence maggie koerth / 9:20 am thu, feb 21, 2013 you're not a doctor, but you can play one on the ipad the epidemic intelligence service is the crack cdc team that investigates new diseases.
