(a note: i’m neither an epidemiologist nor a physician. i remain open to a wide range of claims about plausible scenarios both of just how contagious is the coronavirus and of its lethality. but i am an economist who has spent his adult lifetime – now one that’s been quite long – observing governments. as vincent geloso argues in the piece linked above, we must all expect that most government officials will opt for worst-case scenarios and trumpet these as though these scenarios are the only ones that are legitimate. further, we should all – although, alas, we won’t all – recognize the grave danger of the viral expansion of government power.) i was recently interviewed by dan proft. hans eicholz reviews the great stephen davies’s the wealth explosion. add a comment share quotation of the day… by don boudreaux on march 27, 2020 in country problems, nanny state, other people's money, philosophy of freedom, reality is not optional, seen and unseen, social responsibility tweet … is from pages 262-263 of george will’s excellent 2019 book, the conservative sensibility: [welfare] states presuppose economic dynamism sufficient to generate investments, job creation, corporate profits, and individuals’ incomes from which come tax revenues needed to fund entitlements. but welfare states produce in citizens an entitlement mentality and a low pain threshold. that mentality inflames appetites for more entitlements, broadly construed to include all government benefits and protections that contribute to welfare understood as material well-being, enhanced security, and enlarged leisure. the low pain threshold causes a recoil from the rigors, insecurities, and dislocations inherent in the creative destruction of dynamic capitalism. the recoil takes the form of protectionism, regulations, and other government-imposed inefficiencies that impede the economic growth that the welfare state requires. dbx: yes. ‘redistribution’ requires the existence of something to be redistributed. and because cash, as such, can’t be used as food, clothing, shelter, or for any other human purposes beyond kindling for fires or flooring for the cages of pet hamsters, meaningful ‘redistribution’ requires the existence of real goods and services. the existence of real goods and services, in turn, requires production. and production – to be worthy of its name – must be of real goods and services that are useful to human beings. ‘producing’ chocolate-covered pine cones is, in economic reality, to produce nothing; it is instead to waste human labor and chocolate. to ensure that toiling human minds and hands actually produce, rather than waste, requires that the toiling hands and minds have knowledge not only of what people want, but of what people want most – how people rank their consumption possibilities. to toil to produce goods and services ranked low at the cost of not producing goods and services ranked more highly is waste almost as bad as toiling to produce goods and services not wanted at all. in short, toiling, in order not to be wasteful, must be guided by knowledge of what people wish most to consume. to the extent that toiling is not so guided, it is wasteful. the best means that humanity has stumbled upon for both informing people what to produce and giving people appropriate incentive to produce what ‘should’ be produced is the competitive market system and the money prices that it generates. (and, yes, the market – no less than language – was indeed stumbled upon and crafted largely by evolution; it was not designed and consciously implemented.) ironically, perhaps the biggest flaw in this system is the fact that it works so marvelously well. the material fruits that it generates are so magnificent in form and volume that they appear to those of us blessed to live in market-oriented societies as being automatic, a feature of reality like oxygen or rain. seeming so, the material fruits of markets are far too seldom explored to discover their actual origins. the resulting ignorance of the operation and benefits of markets is rather like a virus that is potentially lethal to the very markets which do too little to dispel this ignorance. add a comment share some links by don boudreaux on march 26, 2020 in country problems, current affairs, fda, innovation, monetary policy, reality is not optional, seen and unseen tweet writing in the wall street journal, charley hooper and david henderson wisely make the case against the absurd 1962 kefauver-harris amendment that fda approval be given, not to drugs that are proven merely to be “safe,” but only to those that are proven to be both “safe and effective.” a slice: further, the kefauver-harris amendments dramatically increased the time and cost of getting new drugs approved. evidence provided by university of chicago economist sam peltzman suggests that the number of new drugs approved dropped by 60% in the decade following the law change. we have fewer ineffective drugs, but also far fewer effective ones than we could have had. also rightly critical of the fda is my intrepid mercatus center colleague veronique de rugy. gmu econ alum ryan young and cei are among those who are on the job trying to rid the land of the pestilence of regulations that are harmful to americans’ health. t. norman van cott makes clear that economic prosperity is impossible without production. john o. mcginnis explains the perils of “second-best” arguments. george selgin busts the latest manifestation of what can be politely and generously described as darned lunatic notions of monetary policy. add a comment share quotation of the day… by don boudreaux on march 26, 2020 in complexity & emergence, economics, prices, reality is not optional, seen and unseen tweet … is from page 131 of the 11th (2006) edition of one of greatest economics textbooks of all time: paul heyne’s, peter boettke’s, and david prychitko’s the economic way of thinking (original emphasis): we are extremely dependent on changing money prices to secure effective cooperation in our complex, interdependent society and economy. when prices are not permitted to signal a change in relative scarcities, suppliers and demanders receive inappropriate signals. they do not find, because they have no incentive to look for, ways to make accommodations to one another more effectively. it is important that people receive some such incentive, because there are so many little ways and big ways in which people can accommodate – ways that no central planner can possibly anticipate, but which in their combined effect make the difference between chaos and coordination. changing money prices, continuously responding to changing conditions of demand or supply, provides just such an incentive. dbx: no principle of economics is more important than the one explained here by heyne, boettke, and prychitko, and few principles are as important. further, absolutely nothing learned in advanced economic classes should in any way diminish the centrality, power, and practical relevance of this insight. none of the many formal demonstrations that any competently trained assistant professor of economics can scribble on a scratch pad to show conditions under which this government-imposed maximum price and that government-mandated minimum wage might yield “net welfare benefits” has any practical relevance. well, perhaps this ability does have the practical trait of allowing assistant professors either to demonstrate their pedantry or to get an audience with politicians seeking academic cover for interventions into markets. but in the real world, market-set prices and wages are the only practical means to inform as well as to incite producers and consumers to adjust as well as is humanly possible to the realities of resource availabilities, of technical constraints, and of each other’s wants, expectations, and abilities. government restrictions on prices and wages inevitably spread misinformation and create discoordination and discord. the fact that price controls and minimum wages are often politically popular means only that too many people are ignorant of vital economic principles. government officials, of course, pander to this economic ignorance. add a comment share an open letter to florida’s attorney general by don boudreaux on march 25, 2020 in current affairs, myths and fallacies, prices, reality is not optional, seen and unseen tweet ms. ashley moody, attorney general state of florida tallahassee, fl ms. moody: you issued more than 40 subpoenas in response to so-called “price gouging.” and you justified your actions with this written statement: “floridians are searching for essential products needed to stay safe and healthy during this covid-19 pandemic. sadly, when they find these products for sale online, they often discover that the price tag makes them unattainable. this is unacceptable and unlawful.” your economics is mistaken: the price tag about which you complain is what prevents these products from being “unattainable.” the high prices that you aim to push lower entice suppliers to exert the extra efforts necessary to ramp up production of such products and to speed them to market. these high prices also encourage consumers to use these products more prudently. your efforts to push these prices lower, therefore, will ensure that such products very soon become “unattainable.” products available for sale at unusually high prices are obtainable, for they actually are for sale (if only at these high prices). in contrast, products unavailable for sale at ‘normal’ prices are not actually for sale; they are utterly unobtainable – which means that their prices then are infinite. if you truly wish to ensure maximum access of floridians to the goods and services that they seek, cease and desist from interfering with market prices. sincerely, donald j. boudreaux professor of economics and martha and nelson getchell chair

inequality, other people's money, philosophy of freedom tweet … is mark twain’s response to someone who asked him how he could be friends with standard oil vice-president henry h. rogers, whose immense fortune was falsely believed – simply because it was chiefly earned as a result of rogers’ work at standard oil – to be “tainted”: his money is tainted, it taint mine and it taint yours. dbx: it’s a damn shame that this civilized respect for others’ property is today not more widespread. rather than, like samuel clemens, respect and not envy other people’s unusually great material prosperity, today americans read books, articles, and columns by ivy league credentialed academics that actively encourage envy and covetousness of that which one hasn’t earned. and too many americans cast ballots for politicians who solemnly promise to pillage the earnings of peaceful people. this institutionalized envy and pillage is called “progressive.” measuring differences in monetary incomes and wealth, and explaining how the god-state will “redistribute” it all, seems oh-so advanced and scientific. indeed, many people convince themselves that such “redistribution” is positively humane. or so i gather it appears to many. well. this attitude from top to bottom and from back to front, in full, disgusts me. and it should disgust every civilized human being. add a comment share don’t bail out the airlines by don boudreaux on march 25, 2020 in crony capitalism, other people's money, seen and unseen, subsidies tweet two of my mercatus center colleagues – the intrepid veronique de rugy, along with gary leff – make the case against a government bailout of u.s.-based commercial airlines. here are two slices: when the federal government bails out an industry, it shifts resources away from nonsubsidized industries to the subsidized one. because politics drives the bailout decision, this shifting of resources is done largely independently of the merit of the industry or of its claims of special distress. if it were not for the government action, the resources used in bailouts would be directed naturally by the market to other, more productive uses. so while it is easy to see the companies and the jobs that are today saved by bailing out the airlines, we don’t know what goods and services are thereby not produced and consumed because of the bailout, what non-airline companies don’t survive because of the bailout, and what jobs aren’t created and sustained in nonsubsidized industries. the history of bailouts also suggests that they prop up weak firms long enough to make their dysfunctions worse, thus requiring further intervention in the long run. economist bill shughart, for instance, looked at the history of bank bailouts in the united states and found that “the record of government bailouts of private financial institutions in the 1930s, of continental illinois bank in 1984 (which cost $8 billion) and of the entire u.s. savings & loan industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s (which cost $125 billion) teaches that emergency loans keep weak institutions alive just long enough for their problems to increase. bailouts encourage more risk-taking and eliminate the freedom to fail that is just as essential to a free-market economy as the freedom to succeed.” ….. no one should be surprised that the airline industry was the first to ask for a government bailout, considering its long history as a government-protected industry. today, despite “deregulation” (which largely means that the government no longer tells airlines where they are permitted to fly and how much they should charge), airlines remain intricately intertwined with government as a means of subsidy and protection from competition. a bailout of airlines funnels taxpayer money to private airline investors and creditors, and it is not necessary to prevent an economic contagion. many large us airlines have demonstrated an ability to successfully fly through bankruptcy. and bailing out airlines is an inefficient way to protect workers because it focuses on a single industry’s employees, and only the most visible of those workers, while ignoring the many airline-industry contractors who have already lost their jobs and won’t have work in times of reduced demand. while airlines should not receive a bailout as a matter of public policy, if politics dictates one, then the process should not become a grab bag of interests and preferred policy prescriptions stapled on in haste. such bailout packages risk doing long-term damage to the industry that the bailout is trying to save. add a comment share some links by don boudreaux on march 25, 2020 in country problems, crime, current affairs, data, environment, health, legal issues, myths and fallacies, risk and safety, seen and unseen, the economy tweet notre dame university law professor stephen smith (a fellow graduate with me of uva law’s class of 1992) busts the mythical claim that the united states has no abnormally – and unnecessarily – high rate of incarceration. here’s his well-grounded conclusion: we would be much better off as a society—both safer and truer to our libertarian ideals—if we reserved prisons and jails exclusively for our most dangerous and most incorrigible criminals, made serious efforts to rehabilitate instead of merely warehouse inmates, and relied on less-invasive means to address other social problems. also helping to bust the myth that incarceration rates in the u.s. aren’t too high by any reasonable standard is clark neily. ben zycher isn’t impressed with house republicans’ proposals for climate policy. “personally what i fear the most is the way in which people will respond, at the end of the emergency, to the major economic wreckage we will have to deal with. lots of observers tend to assume that the virus has damaged populism, as now demagogues (including trump) were forced to pick “experts” who are at the helm of our countries. but interventions validated by experts may backfire too. we may end up with a society which is less dynamic, more fearful, and more dependent on government than ever” – so writes the ever-wise alberto mingardi. writing in the wall street journal, stanford university medical professors eran bendavid and jay bhattacharya make the case that covid-19 is likely much less lethal than is now commonly supposed. here’s their conclusion: a universal quarantine may not be worth the costs it imposes on the economy, community and individual mental and physical health. we should undertake immediate steps to evaluate the empirical basis of the current lockdowns. add a comment share quotation of the day… by don boudreaux on march 25, 2020 in complexity & emergence, curious task, hubris and humility, myths and fallacies, reality is not optional, seen and unseen tweet … is from page 92 of my late nobel-laureate colleague jim buchanan’s 1996 article “economic freedom and federalism: prospects for the new century,” as this article is reprinted in james m. buchanan, federalism, liberty, and law (2001), which is volume 18 of the collected works of james m. buchanan: [t]he centrally planned economy failed because it did not, and cannot, utilise either the knowledge of opportunities or the incentive structures that emerge more or less naturally in markets. dbx: yesterday i was interviewed by juliette sellgren for her forthcoming podcast series, juliette’s uncommon knowledge. juliette is a high-school junior with uncommonly good sense about the economy. the first question she asked me is what’s the one thing that kids her age should know that they don’t. i replied: “how incredibly complex and productive is the world we live in.” (i don’t recall my exact words, but they were something along these lines.) this complexity goes unnoticed, ironically, because it is so all-encompassing, and because market economies work with such amazing smoothness and reliability. (note that i do not here say – and i do not mean to imply – that markets are perfect, by whatever criteria you might use to assess their performance.) flip the switch and there’s light. indeed, it’s increasingly commonplace literally just to issue a mere voice command in order to summon light! (“let there be light!” – and there is.) or even better – as is true for my offices at george mason university – is that mere motion turns on the lights. i walk into my office and light happens. or this: press a few buttons on a computer connected in real time to billions of sites around the globe and, at a cost of less than an ordinary american’s hourly wage, arrange for the market to deliver within 48 hours to your doorstep a new pair of jeans. for a few extra bucks you can have the jeans delivered to you in no more than half that time. and the jeans: who made them? answer: no one. no one. the jeans delivered to your front door literally are the product of the creativity and effort of tens of millions – more likely, hundreds of millions – of individuals spread across the face of the earth. the cotton farmer; the unknown innovator who developed the specific kind of thread used to stitch together the pieces of cotton fabric; the chemist whose efforts are an important input into creating blue dye; each of the actuaries who enable each of the many insurers of all the different enterprises – from farmer to delivery service – to operate profitably; the oil-field workers who toil to drill for oil that is refined into the gasoline that powers the delivery truck; the jeans’ designer; the software engineers whose efforts assist the jeans’ designer, and the other software engineers whose efforts helped to make the navigation system for the delivery truck; the developer of the machine that coated the delivery truck with paint that protects the vehicle from rust; the many employees of the unheralded company that makes the button for the jeans; the many employees for the other unheralded company that makes the zipper for the jeans; the many employees of yet another unheralded company that makes the metal or composite-material matter that form the zipper’s teeth; the … you get the idea. the notion that any human mind, or committee of human geniuses, can gather all the detailed knowledge and information that the market uses every moment in the process of making available a ‘simple’ pair of jeans is beyond preposterous. i know no word to fully capture how absurd such a notion is. and so the conceit that a human mind or committee of human geniuses can plan and operate an entire economy – or can surgically intervene in ways that are productive into this stupendously complex globe-spanning market process of human cooperation and competition – would be utterly laughable were this conceit not so dangerous to human prosperity. words – often so beautiful and alway indispensable to our humanity – are sometimes deeply misleading. “the u.s. economy” – “the kentucky economy” – “the aluminum industry” – “middle-income workers” – “the annual volume of peru’s imports” – “u.s. exporters” – “average real wages” – “the interest rate” – “the price of bacon” – “middle managers” – “the health-care sector” – “the distribution of income in france.” each of these terms, and many others akin to them, have some real and useful meaning when considered carefully. but they too-often mislead, for at least two reasons: first, word and terms such as these create the illusion that these phenomena are things defined by nature rather than by human convention and purposes. second, words and terms such as these hide the enormous swirling complexity that gives rise to the measurable surface manifestations. these two false impressions create the fatal conceit that human beings can consciously intervene in ways that are likely to improve matters – to move reality closer to some imagined state of perfection. bernie bros and thomas piketty want a more equal ‘distribution’ of income: no problem, use the state to take money from some people and give it to others. simple. mission accomplished. no or few unintended negative consequences. oren cass and other nationalist conservatives want to slow the rate at which economic change – especially that which is fueled directly by international trade – causes job churn: no problem, use the state to slow this change. simple. mission accomplished. no or few unintended negative consequences. “progressives” want a greater abundance and more widespread availability of high-quality health-care: no problem, hire a few elite-school economists to draw up a scheme for using government power to overhaul “the” health-care sector and, voilà, high-quality health-care is more abundant and available. neocons perceive that the political and economic conditions of some foreign countries are not ideal – or at least not ideal for americans: no problem, send in u.s. “advisors,” “aid,” and, if necessary, troops. we – our best and our brightest and our bravest – will fix the problem! there will be no or few unintended negative consequences. (and if you insist otherwise, well, that reveals you to be unpatriotic as well as ignorant of america’s glorious history.) how naive are such conceits borne of the failure to grasp the enormous complexity of social and economic realities. add a comment share ← previous entries enter your email address to subscribe: blogroll a force for good aier alt-m askblog beacon big questions bleeding heart libertarians carpe diem cato@liberty chicago boyz conversable economist coordination problem coyote blog econlog econstories econtalk fee fred blog free advice free association greg mankiw grumpy economist hit & run ideas kids prefer cheese knowledge problem learn liberty blog mad about trade marginal revolution mishtalk money illusion newmark's door notes on liberty overcoming bias prudentia rational optimist the sports economist thinkmarkets volokh conspiracy warren's space categories categories select category a protectionist is… adam smith agriculture antitrust archaeological economics archived writings balance of payments beautiful bleg books budget issues business as usual cafe conversation charity civil asset forfeiture civil society cleaned by capitalism competition complexity & emergence cooperation country problems creative destruction crime crony capitalism cuba curious task current affairs data debt and deficits dinner table economics doux commerce economic exercises economics education energy entertainment environment everyday life fables family fda film financial markets food and drink fooled by randomness foreign aid freeman frenetic fiddling gambling with other’s $ games government intervention great depression growth hayek hayeku health history housing hubris and humility hunger immigration inequality inflation innovation intervention inventive intervention law legal issues less than meets the eye looking for your help man of system markets in everything media monetary policy movies music myths and fallacies nanny state not from the onion other people’s money parenting philosophy of freedom podcast politics population prices property rights question for protectionists reality is not optional regulation religion risk and safety science scientism seen and unseen self-deception social responsibility social security sports standard of living state of macro stimulus subsidies taxes technology terrorism the crisis the economy the future the hollow middle the profit motive trade travel truth-seeking & ideology uncategorized video virginia political economy wal-mart war web/tech weblogs work recent posts what about economists’ expertise?
