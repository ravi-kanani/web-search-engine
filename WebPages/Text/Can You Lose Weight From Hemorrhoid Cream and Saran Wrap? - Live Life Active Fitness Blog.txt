december 16, 2013 by erin weiss 5 comments with two christmas parties this past weekend, i found myself not wanting to do much on sunday. it was nice to be able to just relax on the couch and catch up on some of my crazy reality tv shows 🙂 true story. i was then caught off guard when a show started talking about losing weight with hemorrhoid cream and saran wrap. let me explain… i found myself watching a new show called courtney loves dallas on bravo. this is a show about a fashion blogger who is balancing her blogging career as well as trying to find love. i found myself watching several episodes because of the blogging side of it all since that’s what i do as well! the show was entertaining and was required zero thinking…that’s my kind of thing on sundays! i was entertained until courtney’s personal trainer told her she should lather herself up with hemorrhoid cream and then wrap herself in saran wrap to lose some weight before her upcoming photo shoot. photo source & taken by molly miller of a piece of toast my first reaction was “what?!? are you frickin’ kidding me?” i wouldn’t have been that surprised if courtney had come up with this little idea herself since a lot of women would try anything to drop a couple pounds. maybe i was the most disappointed that this suggestion came from her personal trainer! as a result, i decided to do some research on this topic. i wanted to see if this personal trainer’s suggestion was based on truth at all. at home hemorrhoid cream and saran wrap remedy how to do a body wrap at home: lather your stomach, legs & butt (any problem areas) with prep h or another hemorrhoid cream. wrap your body in saran wrap. drink a lot of water while the wrap is on. remove after a night’s sleep or in 24 hours can you lose inches and tighten up your body by rubbing hemorrhoid cream on your body and then wrapping saran wrap around yourself? wow that sounded weird! i’m going to have to say that will be the one and only time i’ll ever type that sentence in my life 🙂 let’s talk about the science behind the cream. hemorrhoid cream is used for inflammation in the lower rectum/anus area caused by swollen veins. preparation h is one popular brand and it contains astringents which help shrink swollen tissues. it is recommended to only use in the rectum area due to the type of tissues. i have heard of preparation h to be used under swollen eyes to reduce puffiness. i’ve have never tried this, but i also never thought it was that crazy of an idea. in the end, i guess it’s not too unlikely that people would think that you can tighten other areas of your body with the same approach. there’s a part of me where i guess i can see where courtney’s trainer was going with this idea… not that i agree with it at all though… the reason body wraps are popular is because they cause water loss in your body. the saran wrap helps you lose water weight temporarily but the results will not last. as soon as you start drinking water and have a meal, the skin will rehydrate. it will then return to where it was before the wrap treatment. the only reason you will be able to lose inches and keep it off for more than a couple hours is by eating well and exercising often. there is no way to spot reduce and maintain the loss. in order to lose inches, you’ll have to shed body fat throughout your body. once again…i do not recommend doing this. just go sweat it out at the gym! courtney admitted on her blog that she did not see or feel any changes after trying this. do you think it’s possible to lose weight from hemorrhoid cream?

as a personal trainer i would never suggest such a thing! reply erin says december 16, 2013 at 12:16 pm haha me either 🙂 reply deana pereira says january 26, 2017 at 7:34 pm hello…as i type i am wrapping in vicks n satan wrap…normally i add coffee grinds…wet…to add to the mix in drawing out fluids. not only does it draw water, it stimulates elimination of toxins, helps bowels and is amazing at stretch mark appearance. i’ve lost 72 pounds and have tried everything…this is making me happier in the overall skin look. i swear by wraps and green tea. drinking water helps hydrate and remove toxins. i wrap every other day. just a little personal testimonial…ooh. ..preparation h works for eye puffiness and minor wrinkles. cream is best as original is petroleum based and not good if you wear make up… and i did the nutella hair color trick…it works great to go brown. hope it helps…or gives you a laugh. reply joe molina says august 29, 2018 at 3:08 am i’ve never tried it, but i was at the gym tonight and i saw 2 guys using this cream around the stomach area and using saran wrap, and i had to ask them. hey is that a sweat cream. he said no it preparation h cream it helps thin out the skin for a better definition and fat burn when you go in the steam room. i was shock so i started to do research and that’s how i found your blog. weird but i wouldn’t mine trying it. lol reply morgan says may 22, 2019 at 11:35 pm so this is an army trick used durimg height and weight. hemorrhoid creams (like preh) used to have steroids and that was the key ingredient. steroids are not only an anti inflammatory, but can also cause a reaction known as fat cell necrosis or fat cell reduction. steroids literally shrink fat cells, that’s why people who use them for muscle building are so toned and trimmed. so while preparation h will not work anymore (they removed the steroids) and actual steroid cream will. reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website popular posts 1. eating clean grocery list – approved foods list 2. 101 gym quotes 3. how exercise can affect a woman’s menstrual cycle – live life active fitness blog 4. can you lose weight from hemorrhoid cream and saran wrap?
