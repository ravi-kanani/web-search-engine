those with data science knowledge is growing in almost every industry. there’s never been a better time to have data skills. according to gartner, “50% of organizations …lack sufficient ai and data literacy skills to achieve business value.” businesses are eager to hire employees who can fill those skill gaps. plus, forbes reports that data science roles and related jobs have grown more than 650% in the last 8 years, while the number of qualified individuals is not enough to fill the need. with an abundance of opportunity and high growth potential, now is a great time to invest in your data skills. cloud security “the cloud” has been a buzzword for years, but that doesn’t keep it from still being a top trend. in the past two decades, more and more companies have migrated to the cloud and made it a key part of their infrastructure. in fact, according to kaspersky lab, “over three quarters (78%) of businesses…already make use of at least one form of cloud service and the same number (75%) are planning to move more applications to the cloud in the future.” with all of this data going into the cloud, the demand for professionals with knowledge of the cloud and a speciality in security is skyrocketing. entrepreneur predicts that cloud cyber-security platforms are “expected to become a $460 million industry,” and they are all looking to hire. making it the perfect time to pursue a career in cloud computing. artificial intelligence roles for people with skills in artificial intelligence have been steadily rising for years, and they’re not stopping now. according to

just machine learning engineers. according to guy berger, the principal economist at linkedin, “ai has infiltrated every industry, and right now the demand for people skilled in ai is outpacing the supply for it.” forbes reports that hiring growth for ai roles “encompasses a few different titles within the space that all have a very specific set of skills despite being spread across industries.” after all, ai is used for more than just self-driving cars and pandora’s radio algorithm. these days, it’s common for enterprise companies to use it to automate everything from hr to their own applications. with that in mind, the opportunities in ai are endless. ready to look for a job? if these job trends for 2020 have you excited about the possibility of finding a new role, then it’s time
