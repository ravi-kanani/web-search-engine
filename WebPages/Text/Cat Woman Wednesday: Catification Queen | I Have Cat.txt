(i love how they have place for the humans to hang too so everyone can enjoy the outdoors together!) not only is her home optimized for cat stimulation and relaxation, she also spoils them with cat birthday parties and of course they receive gifts on christmas morning ‚Äì including presents from their 2-legged grandpa! priscilla‚Äôs love of cats extends to her wardrobe, which includes hundreds of articles of clothing with a feline flare! even her walls are adorned with a large collection of cat art, including three different gallery walls filled with original cat art, prints, and commissioned portraits of her cats. priscilla is also talented photographer so check out her cat-filled instagram page @pjfore. even one of her cats mickey (whose birthday photos are included in this post) has his own instagram account @mickey_the_blue_eyed_kitty. if you‚Äôre a cool cat man or cat woman ‚Äì or know one ‚Äì i accept guest posts so send them my way to tamar@ihavecat.com. they should be approximately 500-800 words in length with photos (of course!). we like featuring cat men and women who buck the traditional stereotypes. check out previous cat man monday and cat women wednesday posts for inspiration! this entry was posted in cats and tagged cat birthday, cat lady, cat man, cat woman wednesday, catification, decorating wtih cats. bookmark the permalink. ‚Üê 5 ways cats can improve your (human) relationships ‚Äúshop cats of new york‚Äù is here! ‚Üí 15 responses to cat woman wednesday: catification queen momma kat and her bear cat says: november 16, 2016 at 5:58 am i‚Äôm jealous ‚Ä¶ i have cat says: november 16, 2016 at 9:45 pm i know right?
