(my poor parents!). with this business i realized i’d achieved my lifelong dream and could hang around the house all day doing cat stuff with my cat buds and so, housecat club! a lot of my inspiration for toys comes from the people i love, whether it be their favorite foods or things that remind me of them. the first toy i ever made, a pierogi, is for my friend andrew who is a proud ukrainian and dances the polka with me every year at his church’s annual pierogi festival. baloney enjoying a vegan catnip deviled egg i mentioned being a vegan, and because of that all of my toys are handcrafted using vegan and recycled materials with certified usa organic catnip. may people as, “what makes your cat toys vegan?” whereas most cat toys are made from wool felt, ours are made from either eco felt, which is produced from recycled bottles, or viscose which comes from tree fibers. but let me back up a moment to the fiancé part. i had my current cats when i met my now fiancé patrick. we met online, long-distance, and before i agreed to meet him i made sure he was not only accepting of but embraced my three cats, a number that will undoubtedly multiply. my fiancé patrick with uncle nino he said that he figured they were a deal-breaker since my online dating profile said “i’m looking for a decent father figure for my cat sons,” and told me that although he had never lived with cats, he loved all animals and thought he’d be a good fit for the part. in the past people have been really freaked out by my hairless cats, so i was a bit worried that he wouldn’t know how to react to them. he soon quelled all of my doubts and the first time he met them he picked them up and kissed them! in that moment, i knew he was my soul mate. *********** hmmm, i wonder if patrick has a single older brother…..! don’t forget to check out ashlynn’s toys and use ihavecat at checkout for free shipping for the next month!
