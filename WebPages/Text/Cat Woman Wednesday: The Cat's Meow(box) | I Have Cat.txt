(instagram @zacandharvey) meowbox was conceived when she was on facebook one night (i‚Äôm seeing a theme!) and kept seeing ads for doggie subscription boxes. she was surprised to learn there weren‚Äôt similar products for cats at that time. so right at that very moment she decided she could do it, and so she did! while olivia may have been a trailblazer, others have followed her lead into the subscription cat box market place. when asked what makes meowbox unique, olivia responds here are a few things that set them apart from their competition, ‚Äúeach and every single meowbox has the cats‚Äô names handwritten inside the lid. it‚Äôs important that the cats know that the meowbox is just for them. the other cool thing we do is donate a can of food to a shelter for each box sold. the program is called one box can and so far we‚Äôve fed over 50,000 kitties in shelters. we like this program because customers can actually see precisely where they are making a difference.‚Äù meowbox subscribers receive a unique ‚Äúcan code‚Äù for the can donated on their behalf, allowing them to literally track it as it makes its journey to the rescue! if you‚Äôre a rescue that would like to benefit from the one box can program, apply to be considered here! as a (still) singleton living in the city ‚Äì with cats, i had to ask olivia about dating with felines. her experience has been that, ‚Äúcats have zero correlation with my ability to score a date. as an entertaining joke, i have told men that i have 10 cats, which isn‚Äôt outlandish given the line of work i‚Äôm in, and no one seems to bat an eyelash.‚Äù when i challenged her about men not thinking she was a ‚Äúcrazy cat lady‚Äù upon the mention of 10 cats, she offered to run an experiment to prove her point. that would certainly make for an interesting blog entry‚Ä¶ zac posing with his very own meowbox (instagram @zacandharvey) as an aside, with the holidays right around the corner, meowbox subscriptions make a great gift for any kitty on your list! they have a range of subscriptions to choose from! you can even gift just one box! this entry was posted in cats, holiday gift guide and tagged cat lady, cat toys, cat treats, cat woman, cat woman wednesday, gift guide, holiday gifts. bookmark the permalink. ‚Üê cat woman wednesday: housecat club founder ashlynn brink i owe my first book to: a shower, gone girl & grumpy cat‚Äôs birthday ‚Üí 11 responses to cat woman wednesday: the cat‚Äôs meow(box) pingback: cat woman wednesday: the cat‚Äôs meow(box) - cats n things pingback: cat woman wednesday: the cat‚Äôs meow(box) | cats n things jmuhj says: october 5, 2016 at 1:07 pm what an amazing idea!
