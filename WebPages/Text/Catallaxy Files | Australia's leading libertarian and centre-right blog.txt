posted on 7:37 am, march 28, 2020 by rafe champion has any of our family been infected? any member of our immediate family and close friendship network? any of our more diffuse family, secondary friends, casual acquaintances, workmates and clubmates? how many feel a sense of threat due to red flags – age, lung and respiratory conditions, compromised immune systems? how voluntarily embraced the more extreme forms of lockdown in advance of directions? all ok personally although some close family have multiple predisposing conditions and started to take a lot of care very early in the piece. something a bit lighter from jo nova. courtesy of heath robinson , not just the inventor of whacky machines! share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in australian story, covid-19, rafe | 1 comment a wonton insult posted on 2:22 am, march 28, 2020 by currencylad g-7 failed to agree on statement after us insisted on calling coronavirus ‘wuhan virus.’ in the chop/stick terminology stand-off, the former claim they want to avert asian-americans being assaulted over the chinese illness. it goes without saying that this is an invention packaged for the media – who will and already have loyally promoted it. the real reason is that when it comes to china, the g-6 is yellow. share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in covid-19, fake news, politics of the left | 3 comments do not resuscitate posted on 1:50 am, march 28, 2020 by currencylad share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in international, shut it down. fire them all. | 8 comments open forum: march 28, 2020 posted on 12:01 am, march 28, 2020 by sinclair davidson share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in open forum | 95 comments at long last a practical suggestion to deal with the economic consequences of the cv posted on 6:16 pm, march 27, 2020 by steve kates from the onion, of course. this, however, not from the onion, but seems related. it is a story you will see today, if you see it at all, and never again after: former senate staffer who opposes trump accuses biden of sexual assault. this is a story that @readealexandra has been trying to tell since it happened in 1993. it's a story about sexual assault, retaliation and silencing. #metoo https://t.co/yhz3ifi9a5 — katie halper (@kthalps) march 25, 2020 why anyone thinks this is newsworthy is completely beyond me. share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in american politics, economics and economy, ethics and morality | 7 comments ruse in the top paddock posted on 5:21 pm, march 27, 2020 by currencylad to refresh my memory, i was doing some crisis management research yesterday into the near-starvation of the earliest european australians in 1788. i was mainly interested in the details of how governor phillip managed the situation and how one would categorise his strategy, philosophically. i had read enough keith hancock and n.g. butlin to know economics in australia had a dirigiste tilt from the start. during the initial years of an era butlin described as the “bridgehead economy,” the commissariat oversaw and supplied all necessities. simple markets, private ownership, self-improvement and industry were by no means discouraged but it would be fair to say they had a secondary – even novel – status in the scheme of things, tiny though the scheme was in those days. ignorance of australian conditions, lack of foresight and bad luck eventually led to a collapse in livestock production and agriculture. many seeds brought from england were lifeless when the colonists planted them and transported provisions generally had run down to desperation levels by september 1788. enter the cargo cult. phillip dispatched the sirius to the cape where extra supplies were purchased – four months’ worth – but this was no long-term solution. michael crowley continues: governor phillip then conducted an experiment – he wanted to see how long it would take a man to become self-sufficient. he had an acre-and-a-half cleared for james ruse, and promised that if he could feed himself, he would be rewarded with a land grant of 30 acres. it was generally thought impossible for a man to live off the land but ruse accomplished it. he is known as the continent’s first settled self-sufficient farmer, and today there is a james ruse high school. captain watkin tench devotes a page to the ‘humble adventurer’, much of it in ruse’s own words: ‘i was bred a husbandman, near launcester in cornwall. i cleared my land as well as i could with the help afforded me. i have now an acre and a half in bearded wheat, half an acre in maize and a small kitchen garden…’ it would have been a psychological turning point in the colony and gradually more convicts became settlers following in ruse’s path. it occurred to me that following the present pandemic – when thousands will be looking for opportunities and the nation should be looking to imbue itself with a new, vigorous self-sufficiency – perhaps we could revive the phillips/ruse experiment. what if parcels of land currently lying fallow and useless in ‘our’ national parks were granted to young settlers on the understanding that they could stay – and own – if they made it work? true, the skillset necessary would mean only experienced graziers and farmers would meet the selection criteria but the employment opportunities for others would still be substantial. the plan would also improve land management across vast swathes of the country, protecting communities from the ravages of neglect-fuelled bushfires. as for the question of phillips’ economic philosophy – back where i started – was his experiment ‘mutual obligation’ welfarism or primitive capitalism? was it both? it did the trick either way. share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in economics and economy, history | 28 comments bug boffins: trump tests positive for being right posted on 5:04 pm, march 27, 2020 by currencylad paul kelly, 17 days ago: working-class virus crisis threatens donald trump. this is a new test for trump. so far, he has looked out of his depth, peddling as late as monday foolish tweets including a dismissal of coronavirus in comparison with the common flu. anthony s. fauci, m.d. et alia, editorial of the new england journal of medicine, today: if one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. this suggests that the overall clinical consequences of covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to sars or mers, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively. share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in covid-19, fake news | 12 comments the empire strikes back posted on 3:57 pm, march 27, 2020 by rafe champion academics are not a complete waste of space. the medical crisis does not demonstrate that free trade, open capital accounts and liberal immigration policies are a mistake. people taking to social media to suggest that closed economies could have better protected themselves are plain wrong. the fact of the matter is that toilet paper is manufactured in australia. i have yet to see a shortage of imported manufactured goods. the arguments for free trade remain as strong today as they did last year. share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in classical economics, rafe | 19 comments models officially dumped posted on 2:37 pm, march 27, 2020 by currencylad coronavirus data doesn’t match the doomsday media predictions. johns hopkins center for health security: we’ve got this. coordinator for the white house coronavirus task force, deborah birx: the predictions of the models don’t match the reality on the ground in china, south korea, or italy. we’re about 5 times the size of italy. if we were italy, and you did those divisions, italy should have close to 400,000 deaths. they’re not close to achieving that. models are models. [t]here is enough data of the real experience with the coronavirus on the ground to really make these predictions much more sound. so when people start talking about 20% of a population getting infected, it’s very scary, but we don’t have data that matches that based on our experience. italy has recorded 8,215 deaths. many of these are suspected of having been attributed to the virus loosely . share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in covid-19, fake news | 33 comments friday forum: march 27, 2020 posted on 12:00 pm, march 27, 2020 by sinclair davidson share this: twitter facebook google reddit linkedin posted in open forum | 1,081 comments ← older posts liberty quote an economy breathes through its tax loopholes. — barry bracewell-milnes recent comments crossie on open forum: march 28, 2020 egg_ on open forum: march 28, 2020 up the workers! on how is the cat family travelling?
