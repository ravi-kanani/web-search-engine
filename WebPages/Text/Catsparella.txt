(via @proplancat) we were also there gathering stories for @proplancat, which just went live on twitter and instagram last week! i'd love for you to follow us and tag your cat photos with #mygreatcat for a chance to be featured in the community. as an added incentive, if you also mention @catsparella in your tweets or instagram posts, i'll send you a surprise when we launch the pro plan cat facebook page in april! as for the rest of the conference, it truly was a cat lovers paradise. after taking in an inspiring discussion with nasty gal ceo sophia amoruso, we headed to the infamous mashable house, aka heaven on earth for a pop culture enthusiasts who spend the bulk of their waking hours on the internet. i came in like a wrecking ball... after signing signing my life away on a release form, i had the opportunity to swing on a wrecking ball, miley style. s.h. + g.c. = best frans forever next, i turned into a real life cat emoji when i got to take a picture with grumpy cat! the internet's most famous feline was there representing friskies (another purina brand, natch), and delivering food to needy cats in the austin area. the iron throne just got a whole lot cattier. i thought i couldn't take any more excitement after that, but boy, was i wrong. a stop at the game of thrones exhibit across town was another highlight of the trip, and a chance to sit on the iron throne brought out my inner cersei (after a brief hiatus, my cattitude is back!). cat cash: the economy of internet cat videos panel afterwards, i rushed back to the austin convention center for the most highly anticipated session of the conference: cat cash: the economy of internet cat videos. the panel included will braden (henri, le chat noir), ben lashes (meme manager to grumpy cat, nyan cat, keyboard cat and more), grace suriel (director of social media at animal planet), and scott stulen (curator of the internet cat video festival). lil bub's dude, mike bridavasky, was also in the crowd, but nothing caused more pandemonium than when grumpy cat made a surprise appearance. quincy insisted that i get her good side. the rain wouldn't let up, but an an emergency umbrella run led us to wild about music, where we were greeted by an awesome shop cat named quincy! this spunky girl made my already unforgettable day complete, and wouldn't you know it - she's a social media maven like myself, with her very own twitter account! a+ cat swag day 2 of the conference consisted of a heavy day of sessions (including one about twitter and sharknado, because why not), but once the sun went down, it was time to get my cat party on. the cool cats at animal planet were kind enough to send me a vip invite to their cats live here party, a celebration of all things feline. needless to say, the kitty-themed bash was all i could have dreamed of and more. the glamourpuss was the must-have cocktail of the night (by me). guests were treated to cat-themed cocktails, quirky buttons, and cake pops. kicking it with lil bub in the vip lounge. there was even an appearance in the vip lounge by none other than lil bub! a view from the top of the best cat party ever. the culmination of the bash was a rousing performance from 80s cover band, the spazmatics. i must say, if you're in texas, you must check these guys out. after dancing the night away, i ended up standing in line for a free cronut at 2 a.m. (alas, it did not come to pass). but if that's the worst thing that happened all weekend, i think i did ok. thanks for stopping by to see what i've been up to! if you'd like to keep up with my latest project, follow @proplancat on twitter and instagram, and tag your pics with #mygreatcat for a chance to be featured in our new community! grumpy cat, cash cats & cat parties: sxsw from a cat lady's perspective email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest posted by catsparella at 10:37 pm 6 comments tags: cat party, grumpy cat, personal, pro plan cat, purina, sxsw saturday, february 22, 2014 it's caturday! she lives!! i know it's been quiet around these parts for awhile, but i've been busy at work, consumed with all things dog! earlier this month i covered the westminster kennel club dog show with the purina pro plan social media team, and and even met last year's winner, banana joe! the delightful affenpinscher has catlike qualities which i admire, and his handler, ernesto lara, couldn't have been nicer. oh look, it's me and 'nana joe. now that the dog show is done, i'm turning my attention back to cats as we get ready to launch the pro plan cat community on twitter, facebook, and instagram. it's just one more place where i'll be able to help cat lovers share their stories with the world, and to say i'm excited would be an understatement! shinobii this week's featured feline is a self proclaimed "black beauty," who is "on a mission to show the world how loving and sweet black cats truly are and erase all traces of superstition." daniela writes: this is my gorgeous black beauty, shinobii. she's changed my life with her beauty, elegance, love, and sweet personality. in the words of the fashion queens, "10s across the board!" she walks with confidence and never gets tired of hearing how beautiful she is. her regal attitude is only fit for a queen. curious sophisticated i hope that those who see her as queen see the true beauty of black cats. playful uninhibited i hope that those who see shinobii see how beautiful and sophisticated black cats are and begin to opening their hearts towards them. coy fierce if you can't get enough of this regal feline, you can find her on instagram (@shinobiicat) and facebook, or visit daniela's gatinela cat fashion & accessories boutique, where shinobii is the star!

catsparella has been on hiatus for the past few weeks while i've been settling into my new life in st. louis. as i mentioned in my last update, i moved here at the beginning of december for a job opportunity -- which as some of you correctly guessed is at nestlé purina petcare! i started this blog from my bedroom in 2010 as a creative outlet, and as a way to escape an unfulfilling job in human resources. i am extremely grateful and humbled that i was able to channel my passion for cats into a blog, and eventually a career. it was difficult for me to leave everything i've ever known back in new jersey, but i'm also very excited to start this new chapter in my life. purina is home to iconic cat brands such as cat chow, tidy cats, friskies, and fancy feast, and as part of my role as community manager, i will be leading the pro plan cat community. we are gearing up to launch a brand new page on facebook and twitter in the coming months, and i hope you will join me there! as i look back over the past 3 and a half years, more than anything, i am so thankful for all of the wonderful individuals (human and feline) that i have met. it's been an honor telling your stories, and sharing all of my favorite cat finds with you week after week. that being said, this isn't a goodbye. while i continue to figure out my new life here, i will still pop in with news and updates (and caturday posts!), and hope you will stop by to say hello and see what's new. thank you again to everyone who has gone down this road with me, and taken the time to read, comment, and share one of my posts. catsparella has been one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and i am forever changed because of it. wishing everyone and their kitties a very happy new year filled with cats, cupcakes, and love!

we interrupt this blogging break to bring you a very special caturday, featuring the fabulous monster lekiwi! monster lekiwi erika writes: monster lekiwi is a very special kitten. she was born to a barn cat - a gray tabby - and came from a litter full of orange and gray tabbies. she was the only different one - cream colored and she later developed her beautiful seal points, snowshoes, and kept her blue eyes. i think her father might have been a ragdoll because she goes limp in the typical ragdoll way when she is picked up. monster's uniqueness comes from more than just her beauty though. monster loves to wear clothes. she wears t-shirts and sweatshirts all the time, and it's clear that she loves them the way she walks around showing them off and is very helpful when you put them on her! another unique thing about monster is that she loves car rides. she watches out the window, sits on your lap, and often sits on the storage compartment between the front seats of the car just observing. she also loves going in the pet stores. she walks on her leash, gets carried, or sits in the cart. she does very well with people petting her and i am always complimented on how well-behaved she is and people always say they can't believe it because their cat would be freaking out. the other thing monster loves to do is go outside and go on walks in her harness. we started her doing that as a kitten and she loves it. she likes to just explore and is good at keeping up. monster also is very protective of me - almost like a dog. i only found that out a couple of days ago. i was play-fighting over something with someone and yelling stop and such and monster must have thought i was hurt because next thing i know i see her try to get between me and my friend, and she began biting up and down my friend's arm and attacking them! i have never heard of a cat acting so protective and it was so sweet to me to know she would try to protect me if i were hurt! monster is my best friend, and those are just a few of the things that make her unique and the things that i love about her! special thanks to erika for sharing the inimitable monster lekiwi with us this week! you can follow her on twitter @monsterlekiwi. i hope everyone is having a great caturday, and i will be back with more updates soon!
