our center studies systems like economies, the brain, ecosystems, political systems, social networks, and the internet that consist of many interacting parts, which in turn produce collective behaviors that exceed the capabilities of the constituent parts. centrality measures developed by t. martin and m. newman illustration of a new centrality measure for finding the most important nodes in a network, overcoming some of the problems of previous measures. geographic divisions in online dating cscs professors elizabeth bruch and mark newman analyzed patterns of communication between millions of users of an online dating site and found distinct geographic regions of daters, including separate regions for north and south california, texas, florida, and michigan. slide 0 slide 1 slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 previous slide next slide recent news luis zaman’s pioneering research is highlighted in the latest issue of eeb’s ‘natural selections’ publication. gail kuhnlein, eeb communications, wrote a wonderful comprehensive piece about the work in the zaman lab and how luis came to be a pioneer in the study of core biological questions using computer systems, and so much more. cscs’s james s. mcdonnell foundation postdoctoral fellow jean-gabriel young, and co-authors publish in nature physics "interacting contagions are indistinguishable from social reinforcement" just released in nature physics - is discussed in press release "when coronavirus is not alone: team of complexity scientists present 'meme' model for multiple diseases" all news complex systems is hiring. click here for information. welcome to the center for the study of complex systems the center for the study of complex systems (cscs) is a broadly interdisciplinary program in the college of literature, science and the arts (lsa) at the university of michigan in ann arbor, michigan. our mission is to encourage and facilitate research and education in the general area of nonlinear, dynamical and adaptive systems. subscribe to receive emails about upcoming events at complex systems! click to watch the video animation: plant-pollinator systems under threat this video was created for complex systems professor fernanda valdovinos and valdovinos lab. valdovinos lab studies the structure and dynamics of ecological networks at ecological and evolutionary scales, including their resilience to biodiversity loss, biological invasions, climate change, and exploitation by humans. show your support we strive to support our students and faculty on the front lines of learning and research and to steward our planet, our community, our campus. to do this, the center for the study of complex systems needs your support. learn more give online events mar 27 sph webinar | "applications of complex systems approaches to address public health challenges" joshua epstein, director of the new york university laboratory on agent-based modeling 1:00 pm all events twitter facebook tweets by umichcs university of michigan college of literature, science, and the arts center for the study of complex systems weiser hall suite 700 500 church st ann arbor, mi 48109-1042 cscs@umich.edu click to call 734.763.3301 734.763.3301 734.763.9267 sitemap facebook twitter information for prospective students current students faculty and staff alumni and friends more about lsa about lsa how do i apply?
