there is a real selector that does the former: :nth-child(2 of .bar) { } safari only. here are the tickets for chrome and firefox. ‚Ä¶ read article ‚Äúcss :nth-of-class selector‚Äù our notes / read at www.bram.us nth-child link march 23, 2020 css can influence screenreaders shared by chris coyier ben myers covers some clear examples of where css totally changes what some screen readers announce. for example, some screenreader will see text-transform: uppercase; on a button label that says "add" and read it like an abbreviation, "a.d.d." these cases of css messing with our screenreader announcements are initially shocking, perplexing, and maybe even appalling. after all, they seem to conflict with our mental model of css, one that's likely been instilled in us since we started learning web development: ‚Ä¶ read article ‚Äúcss can influence screenreaders‚Äù our notes / read at blog.benmyers.dev accessibility screen readers 1 2 3 ... 320 older how do you stay up to date in this fast‚Å†-‚Å†moving industry?
