as we yield many liberties, could the state perhaps yield back a few others they have taken? might the police who will now ask, “is your journey really necessary under our latest emergency regulations?”, include all who were previously asking, “is your remark really permissible under our modern hate speech laws?” any chance the power of the state, when not enforcing the new rules, could be wholly focussed on fighting things the public consider criminal, not things the politically correct consider offensive?

(one other thought: the she-it-he person who demanded the bakery bake a trans cake has apparently also demanded that it bake a satanist cake, but afaics the commission has not taken action over that. is the commission prejudiced against satanists?) august 15th, 2018 | 24 comments - (comments are closed) a slap in the face becomes a kick in the balls for the education nomenklatura mr ed · civil liberties · education & academia · liberty · self-ownership a fresh instalment in the case of the man, the heroic jon platt, prosecuted for taking his chid out of school in term time for a holiday, but was acquitted by magistrates. scandalously, bureaucrats on the isle of wight appealed against the decision of the magistrates to throw out the case, only to find that the high court has found ‘no error of law’ in the magistrates’ decision, so the acquittal remains. this has now blown back in the face of the bureaucrats, as this decision sets an unwelcome precedent with two high court judges giving a ruling on the law, and meaning that for years, bureaucrats have harassed parents and got many to pay fixed-penalty notices on what was likely, in most cases, to be a wholly wrong interpretation of the law. as mr platt put it: “is there really 100,000 parents who are so criminally incompetent that it warrants dragging them to court?” it appears that the scale of the problem is vast: according to local authority data, almost 64,000 fines were imposed for unauthorised absences between september 2013 and august 2014. and are the bureaucrats saying ‘oh well, the law is the law, we must respect it’? if they are, i can’t hear them. this is, of course, great news for parents in england and wales who may now take their children on holiday in term-time without a realistic prospect of a prosecution. it also means that the old and absurd complaint about prices and supply-and-demand, ‘oh look, holiday prices go up at half-term, how exploitative blah, blah, blah, regulate the holiday industry…‘ will be less easy for buffoons and villains to make out, and there will be a more economic use of resources in the holiday industry, taking use one more step away from the stone age. what’s not to like when the light of freedom flickers more brightly? may 14th, 2016 | 35 comments - (comments are closed) ‘no offence’ – in northern ireland… mr ed · civil liberties · civil liberty & regulation · historical perspective · irish affairs · liberty · slogans & quotations · uk affairs thirteen members of a loyalist marching band, the young conway volunteers, have had their criminal convictions for ‘doing a provocative act likely to cause public disorder or a breach of the peace‘ quashed after the public prosecutor agreed not to oppose their appeals. the non-offence occurred after the marching band found themselves marching in a circle outside st patrick’s church (catholic) in north belfast, whilst playing (allegedly aggravated by hostility) a tune alleged to have been ‘the famine song’ with the presumably catchy refrain ‘the famine’s over, why don’t you go home?‘, but what they said was the beach boys ‘sloop john b‘ (reportedly an easy mistake to make, the basic tune is widely used). how this was proved at the original trial when they presumably were playing a tune on instruments and not singing was not made clear. although now acquitted, the band members agreed to be bound over to keep the peace for 2 years (not a conviction but a promise of good behaviour, breach of which could lead to a 7 day jail term). whilst this acquittal in the face of ‘hate legislation’ is certainly a good thing for liberty, i note the apologetic tone of the response of the orange lodge, which presumably has some connection to the band: in a statement, the county grand orange lodge of belfast welcomed the successful appeal. “we are glad that justice has finally been achieved for these band members who had been wrongly vilified by the media and nationalism,” it said. “there never was an intent to cause offence.” one might ask what on earth were they marching for if not to ‘cause offence‘ (in the subjective sense) on 12th july by their celebration of the lifting of the siege of londonderry? to say that there was ‘no intent to cause offence‘ appears to concede that offence was caused, rather than taken or even perhaps rejoiced in as an opportunity to throw the legal machinery of the state at the band. why not say that this legislation is oppressive, tyrannical and makes the law itself a politicised weapon, a sword, not a shield? to me as an englishman, the whole shebang seems utterly alien, the intolerance and fanaticism on both poles of the ulster divide mark them as having more in common with each other than with insipid, fundamentally apolitical england. whether or not that is a good thing for northern ireland, or for england, may in the long run be another matter. december 1st, 2015 | 10 comments - (comments are closed) trial? what do you mean, trial? guy herbert (london) · civil liberties civil libertarians had noticed that the blair administration is impatient with conviction rates. we have seen real attempts to reduce the availability of jury trials and to lower the burden of proof. and we have had strong hints from the prime minister that he doesn’t regard the principle of innocent until proven guilty as applicable in the modern world. astonishingly, however, none of those is enough. a guilty plea may in future permit prosecutors to operate without court process. idiotically the bbc captions this as “petty criminals could avoid court“: but a better headline would be “criminal convictions without courts”. people will be convicted and punished by prosecutors and police if prosecutors or police can persuade them to confess. this is a recipe for abuse. magistrate’s courts may not be the most reliable finders of fact or interpreters of law, but they have no direct interest in the guilt of the defendant or in clearing up unsolved crimes. they can and do hear defenses and pleas in mitigation. they can, and very occasionally do, insist on entering a not-guilty plea if the defendant appears to be have been browbeaten or to be incapable of understanding his position. the inevitable consequence of introducing summary police punishment will be an assertion on behalf of the authorities that those who are convicted at trial instead of submitting to official processing ought to be more heavily punished because they have somehow wasted the court’s time. which will place the accused under more pressure to make admissions regardless of guilt, regardless of whether prosecutors abuse their position. january 16th, 2006 | comments are closed a new kind of freedom guy herbert (london) · big brother · civil liberties · historical perspective · identity cards as the report stage of the identity cards bill approaches in the lords, a reminder of one highlight from the first day of the committee stage hansard, 15 nov 2005, col.1012: lord gould of brookwood: both the previous speakers—the latter with great emotion—were arguing for freedom. we have to ask what greater freedom is there than the freedom to place a vote for a political party in a ballot box upon the basis of a mandate and a manifesto. that is the crux of it: the people have supported this measure. that is what the noble earl’s father fought for. but that is too trivial an answer. i know that. the fundamental argument is that the truth is that people believe that these identity cards will affirm their identity. the noble lord opposite said that he likes to be in this house and how he is recognised in this house because it is a community that recognises him. that is how the people of this nation feel. they feel that they are part of communities, and they want recognition. for them, recognition comes in the form of this identity card. noble lords may think that that is strange, but it is what they feel. this is their kind of freedom. they want their good, hard work and determination to be recognised, rewarded and respected. that is what this does. of course it is right and honourable for noble lords to have their views, but i say there is another view, and it is the view of the majority of this country. they want to have the respect, recognition and freedom that this card will give them. times have changed. politics have changed. what would not work 50 years ago, works now. it is not just me. i have the words of the leader of your party: “i have listened to the police and security service chiefs. they have told me that id cards can and will help their efforts to protect the lives of british citizens against terrorist acts. how can i disregard that?”. this is not some silly idea of the phoney left. it is a mainstream idea of modern times. it is a new kind of identity and a new kind of freedom. i respect the noble lords’ views, but it would help if they respected the fact that the bill and the identity cards represent the future: a new kind of freedom and a new kind of identity. this is the sort of rhetoric that makes my blood run cold. here’s a prefiguring example: in our state the individual is not deprived of freedom. in fact, he has greater liberty than an isolated man, because the state protects him and he is part of the state. isolated man is without defence. – benito mussolini. terry eagleton (from a review of paxton’s anatomy of fascism in the new statesman) elucidates the connection: conservatives disdain the popular masses, while fascists mobilise and manipulate them. some conservatives believe in ideas, but fascists have a marked preference for myths. if they think at all, they think through their blood, not their brain. fascists regard themselves as a youthful, revolutionary avant-garde out to erase the botched past and create an unimaginably new future. all supporters of the old-fashioned conception of individual liberty, whether they think of themselves as left or right, conservative or progressive, must do what can be done. resist. we should not expect any quarter for outdated ideas under a new kind of freedom.

(one cannot call it a theory.) take saudi arabia. civil liberty does not exist there. it is an alien concept, and, in common with other alien concepts, banned. there is no protection of citizen from state, and no limit to the actions that can be taken. yet terrorism is in robust health. the kingdom’s official figures for the last two years (which one would expect to paint the rosiest picture) are 129 dead and 720 injured among civilians and security forces. more than twice britain’s casualties among a population that may be around a third of ours–reliable figures on anything saudi being hard to come by.

(comments are closed) civilcon/eurocon philip chaston (london) · civil liberties if your political antennae have been sensitive to the undercurrents shimmering across the blogosphere, then you will have picked up the few postings alerting readers to the implications of the civil contingencies bill. the dangers of this giant step towards authoritarianism have been publicised far more effectively both by david carr and on iain murray’s personal weblog, the edge of englands sword: lord lucas has described the civil contingencies bill as comparable to hitler’s enabling act of 1933 which enabled him to transform germany’s weimar republic into his own personal tyranny. i have now read it, and i have to say that he is not exaggerating. readers could argue that this is an invocation of godwin’s law and that, by quoting this passage, i have lost the argument. however, this opinion is that of torquil dirk-erikson, “a noted eurosceptic writer and learned silk”. however, in considering the passage of this act, it should also be noted that the european constitution has a section on ‘civil protection’ as one of the coordinating powers for the european authorities. the government wishes to push through an updated civil contingencies bill in 2004. it does not mention the eu, but the draft eu constitution includes ‘civil protection’ as an area for ‘coordinating action’ and the current treaty mentions the topic vaguely. the bill also enables the creation of arbitrary imprisonable criminal offences. it enables regulations that can delegate powers to anyone or confer jurisdiction on any court or tribunal. this could be an eu body, unaccountable to government or the people. although the draft constitution gives us a veto on a european public prosecutor (the government says it ‘currently’ sees no reason for one) blair has said that he opposes permanent ‘opt-outs’ or being isolated in europe. although the amended bill states that it will not change criminal procedure, the government is happy for the eu to have over-riding powers to do this via the eu constitution. these developments happen at a time when the government is trying to introduce universal id cards and a ‘population register’, and has just announced a national database to carry information on all children, not merely those ‘at risk’ (sunday times, 25.7.04). again there are worrying parallels with european developments. amazingly, mi5’s website, which is listed in preparing for emergencies assures us that “the subversive threat to parliamentary democracy is now negligible”. one giant step along ‘chavez’ blair’s road to a ‘managed democracy’. cross-posted to samizdata. october 16th, 2004 | one comment - (comments are closed) another first philip chaston (london) · civil liberties the british government is advocating the vaccination of children against particular behaviours using the forthcoming array of pharmacotherapy vaccines. these would innoculate children against a host of behaviours that the government defines as anti-social: drinking, smoking, drugs, blogging and so on. the article explains that “doctors would immunize children at risk of becoming smokers or drug users with an injection” and that the program would operate in a way similar to the “current nationwide measles, mumps and rubella vaccination programme.” further the authors reveal that “such vaccinations are being developed by pharmaceutical companies and are due to hit the market within two years.” developments like this are monitored by the centre for cognitive liberty and ethics, whose response was clear: richard glen boire, a legal scholar at the ccle, believes that vaccinating children with “anti-drug” drugs would be “alarming and unlawful, and would signal the first time that neuropharmaceuticals were overtly used to enforce government policy.” aside from the human rights concerns, the uk plan raises serious health questions regarding the long-term effects of these drugs on the complex neurochemistry of the brain. the ccle warns that advances in the neurosciences will challenge the ability of individuals to maintain their cognitive freedom. governments will redefine mental health to use drugs and other neurotechnologies in order to police and channel people’s behaviours.
