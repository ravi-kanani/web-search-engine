pratique. apparently not, unless tim worstall’s denial is merely evidence that he is in on the joke. he writes in today’s times: among the measures introduced in france to deal with the coronavirus is a requirement to fill in a form before going out for a walk. no, really, this is not a joke. as part of the lockdown it is necessary, before leaving the house, to complete and sign a download from the ministry of the interior. name, address, what you think you’re doing and so on. this is not filed with anyone, nor registered. it must simply be carried during the errand. absence, if caught, will lead to a €135 fine. a new form is required for every exit from the house. and yes, there’s a box to tick for “aux besoins des animaux de compagnie” which my memories of exchange visits have as “for the needs of our furry friends”. the solution to a global pandemic is a form for walking the dog. of course, it is easy to mock the french but there is an important point here, for this is an example of a pernicious worldview. that we, the people, are only able to cope if we are told what to do, what we may do. all must be decided and enforced by the clever people in power and nothing left to ordinary folks to get on with. our own tradition is vehemently different. i have surprised people in a number of countries by pointing out that a british policeman isn’t actually allowed to ask — or at least not to insist upon knowing — what it is that you are doing. if accosted, a cheery “going about my lawful business, constable” is all that is required. such liberties might not apply in moments of crisis but they are indicative of a different manner of thinking. a similar restriction is being applied in italy, according to the local.it: now that justification is required simply to be on the street, you’ll need to have a copy ready as soon as you leave the house. if you have access to a printer, you can download the form here. ther’s also now an application able to generate an electronic version of the ‘autocertificazione’ form as many times as needed, to keep handy on your phone with a digital signature. police at checkpoints (such as those at train stations) should also have a stack of paper forms available, and you can ask to take a few. but what if you do not have access to the internet? alternatively you can copy out the whole thing by hand: make sure to write everything exactly as it appears on the form, in full. march 19th, 2020 | 74 comments samizdata quote of the day perry de havilland (london) · civil liberty & regulation · slogans & quotations call a

satel 10 years. by the time her immune system rejected it, aged 60, she had found another donor. satel is now on her third right kidney and is feeling fine. she was fortunate – twice. but as a policy expert the experience left satel deeply dissatisfied with a system that relies on luck and the kindness of strangers. the reason so few kidneys are available for transplant, she contends, is that under the national organ transplant act of 1984, paying for organs is illegal. the us is not exceptional – iran is the only country that allows such transactions and it has no kidney shortage. satel is not advocating an iranian-style market for body parts. but i am. by the way, the “postrel” mentioned as having given sally satel her first donated kidney is virginia postrel, whose writing will be familiar to many of you. february 18th, 2020 | 21 comments down the slippery slope samizdata illuminatus (arkham, massachusetts) · civil liberty & regulation · privacy & panopticon i was in ankara on december 23 last year, in the commercial centre of town in the middle of the day. i walked past a street with a number of cafe/restaurants. i realised i was hungry. i sat down at an outdoor table, looking away from the street. i ordered a sandwich. my sandwich came. it was mediocre, but satisfied the “i am hungry” problem. (this was slightly disappointing of me. turkey is a country of terrific food, and one should plan one’s meals better than just going for the nearest food when one finds oneself hungry). i got out my phone and started reading a book on the kindle app as i was having my lunch. after an indeterminate period of time, i realised i was hearing a high pitched scream behind me. it was probably a woman, but i couldn’t be sure about that. i turned around. there was an almost literal phalanx of riot police, separating the public from what was going on. there was a police van on the other side of the riot police. the person who was screaming was somewhat violently pushed into the van. the rear doors of the van were then closed fairly violently. the van drove off. the riot police then dispersed. they looked like this was heavily rehearsed, and this was something they did every day. there was no riot. there was no demonstration. i don’t know how this started, because i was looking in the opposite direction and i was distracted until i heard the screaming. this looked like a well planned operation to grab a particular person off the street. in broad daylight. in the middle of a busy city. so that people would notice. when i saw that this was happening, i noticed that other people in the cafe were taking pictures with their phones. so i briefly stood up and took a picture with my phone. the police were looking in other directions. one day i will get myself into trouble doing things like this, but in this case, well, i think the police wanted to be noticed. by locals, at least. maybe not foreigners such as myself. a few days later, after visiting a few wonderful archaeological sites in parts of turkey, i was on a bus travelling along the turkish black sea coast from trabzon to the georgian city of batumi. during this journey there were two stops at police checkpoints. at the first one, a police officer got on the bus and everyone was required to show id. the turkish people had bar codes on their id cards scanned electronically by a reader being carried by the police officer. (i held out my passport – the policeman looked at it and nodded). at the second one our id documents were taken off the bus and into the police checkpoint building, before being brought back on the bus. when you book a train ticket in turkey and you are turkish, you don’t even need a ticket. you simply give your id card number when booking the train, and when you board they scan the id card and associate it with the booking. turkey tracks the internal movements of its citizens electronically. they do it like this if you catch a bus or train or plane. if you drive your own car, i suspect it is done with number plate recognition. turkey is a wonderful country full of magnificent things. i visit often. it is also a police state, and a very nasty one. i enjoyed my trip to turkey, but i felt some relief when i reached georgia. a much freer country. february 16th, 2020 | 7 comments i hope so natalie solent (essex) · civil liberty & regulation · opinions on liberty · privacy & panopticon · sexuality · twitter nonsense · uk affairs harry miller: “this is a warershed moment for liberty” the police response to an ex-officer’s allegedly transphobic tweets was unlawful, the high court has ruled. harry miller, from lincolnshire, was contacted by humberside police in january last year after a complaint about his tweets. he was told he had not committed a crime, but it would be recorded as a non-crime “hate incident”. the court found the force’s actions were a “disproportionate interference” on his right to freedom of expression. in a separate story from the one i quote above, the bbc goes on to report that mr justice julian knowles said the effect of police turning up at mr miller’s place of work “because of his political opinions must not be underestimated”. he added: “to do so would be to undervalue a cardinal democratic freedom. “in this country we have never had a cheka, a gestapo or a stasi. we have never lived in an orwellian society.” i did not know we still had judges like that. edit: this is the text of the judgement: miller -v- college of policing, 14 february 2020. february 15th, 2020 | 28 comments samizdata quote of the day samizdata illuminatus (arkham,

bringing a criminal to justice at the cost of telling their victims what they would rather not have known natalie solent (essex) · civil liberty & regulation · privacy & panopticon · self defence & security · self ownership · sexuality · uk affairs a horrible thought occurred to me while reading press accounts of the recent trial and conviction of reynhard sinaga, who may have been britain’s most prolific rapist. sinaga’s modus operandi was as follows: he would wait for men leaving nightclubs and bars before leading them to his flat, often offering them somewhere to have a drink or call a taxi. giving them a drugged drink, believed to have been spiked with ghb, sinaga would then assault the victims while they were unconscious and video the attack with a mobile phone. in this fashion he got away with more than a hundred rapes because his victims did not know they had been raped. finally, in june 2017, his last victim, an 18-year old, regained consciousness during the rape, fought off his attacker, and reported the incident to the police. sinaga was badly beaten and was taken to hospital, while police initially arrested his victim on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. subsequent examination of sinaga’s iphone by the police led to the discovery of more than 3 terabytes of digital video evidence of his assaults and rapes. many of his victims were traceable because sinaga kept their phones, watches, id cards, etc., and he had used social media to reach his unknowing victims online. note the word “unknowing”. the horrible thought that occurred to me was this: some (not all, but a substantial number) of sinaga’s victims have said that their lives were seriously damaged by the police tracing them and telling them that they had been raped while drugged and unconscious. they would have preferred not to know. more painful yet, the fact that they had been raped became public knowledge at the trial. but if the police had not traced sinaga’s victims and marshalled the evidence against him for the judge and the jury to see, he would have been able to continue with his crimes indefinitely. in the end, i would say that in sinaga’s case the public interest had to take precedence: he had to be stopped. yet i think that situations could occur where it might be justifiable to let a criminal go unpunished in order to save his or her unknowing victims from the pain of discovering that they had been wronged. february 12th, 2020 | 39 comments li’s anti-government behaviour brian micklethwait (london) · chinese affairs · civil liberty & regulation · health & medical austin bay at instapundit: li’s anti-government behavior was using a private internet chat group to tell a handful of doctors and medical students that he was seeing signs of a viral epidemic. rather than listening to the message and taking immediate action, the government of china instead spent crucial days suppressing that message and punishing the messenger. dr li wenliang and seven other doctors were arrested for spreading rumours, rumours which turned out to be accurate observations. li has since died of the very disease that he noticed starting to spread. china: don’t just get mad, get even. february 7th, 2020 | 11 comments if women own their bodies they can choose to modify them natalie solent (essex) · civil liberty & regulation · health & medical · middle east & islamic · religion · self ownership · sexuality the bbc reports, calls for ‘virginity repair’ surgery to be banned campaigners are urging the government to outlaw “virginity repair” surgery. many muslim women risk being outcast, or in extreme cases killed, if their spouses or families discover they have had sex before marriage. and some are opting for a medical procedure in which doctors restore a layer of membrane at the entrance to the vagina. but there are concerns a ban would increase the dangers to muslim women by driving the procedure underground. guidelines from the general medical council (gmc) state a patient’s consent to undergo a procedure should come into question if it is suspected of being “given under pressure or duress exerted by another person”. those gmc guidelines are correct. forcing a woman to have her hymen repaired is a serious crime, as is threatening her with violence because she had sex outside marriage to get it broken in the first place. that violent threats so often go unpunished is a national scandal. but the fact remains that most women who go to have their hymens repaired want it done. in less drastic cases they want the procedure for such reasons as to get and keep a husband, to avoid letting their parents know that they no longer adhere to traditional muslim mores, or to avoid a breach with their husband’s family. you may say that it is a bad thing that such crushing social pressure for a bride to be a virgin remains prevalent in some communities in the uk. but the principle that an adult human being owns their own body does not cease to apply because he or she gives in to social pressure. plenty of women get boob jobs and bum lifts because of social pressure, too. are these bad decisions? possibly. cosmetic surgery has risks. but good or bad, the decision is theirs to make. in more drastic cases women want their hymens repaired because it is the only way to protect themselves from the twisted “honour” of their fathers and husbands. of course no woman should have to resort to such desperate measures in order to be safe from murder. but what sort of idiocy is it to see a person taking extreme measures to protect themselves from murder and then to think the course of action that best serves justice is to prosecute the victim – or the surgeon who is helping her keep safe? the usual sort, unfortunately. january 27th, 2020 | 31 comments how dare they solve our problem! natalie solent (essex) · civil liberty & regulation · health & medical · science & technology there is a fascinating article in today’s observer, “out of the lab and into your frying pan: the advance of cultured meat”. (the best comment is from “tintenfische”: “you call that cultured meat? pah, not even close. last week my steak took me to the ballet and a symposium on the evolution of beat poetry as seen through the eye of the beat.”) the author of the article, zoë corbyn – i’ve always liked the name zoë – describes the background: to a certain extent, the science of culturing meat is relatively well understood. the process begins when a cell is taken from an animal and grown up in a lab to permanently establish a culture (called a cell line). the cells can come from a range of sources: biopsies of living animals, pieces of fresh meat, cell banks and even the roots of feathers, which just has been experimenting with. cell lines can either be based on primary cells – for example muscle or fat cells – or on stem cells. stem cells have the advantage that with different nutrients, or genetic modifications, they are able to mature into any cell type. there is also no limit to how long stem-cell lines can live, so it is possible to use them indefinitely to produce a product. once a good cell line – for example, one that grows fast and is tasty – has been selected, a sample is introduced into a bioreactor, a vat of culture medium where the cells proliferate exponentially and can be harvested. the resulting meat cell mush can be formed into a plethora of unstructured items, from patties to sausages – with or without other ingredients added for texture. conventional meat has a variety of cell types from which it derives its flavour, including both muscle and fat, and the companies are trying to broadly replicate that. not everybody is happy that this hoary science fiction trope seems to be on the point of commercial viability. apparently an advertisement in the brussels metro… …contrasts a barn of cows surrounded by greenery to a “meat lab” surrounded by transmission towers. it is the work of the european livestock voice campaign – set up last year by a number of european farming industry groups to stress the potential social impacts of upending the meat industry. cannon to right of them, cannon to left of them. the would-be purveyors of a guilt-free equivalent of meat to vegetarians are also opposed from the other side: the website clean meat hoax was launched last year by an informal group of 16 animal rights scholars and activists. it rails against cultured meat on the grounds that it still suggests that meat is desirable, and that animals are a resource people can draw on. it contrasts with the more pragmatic position other animal rights groups such as people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta) have taken in favour of the technology on the grounds that animals’ lives will be saved. “what is incredible to me is how uncritically this technology is being celebrated and i don’t think that’s an accident – we don’t want to consider the possibility that we can stop eating animals,” says site founder john sanbonmatsu, a philosopher at worcester polytechnic institute in massachusetts. “less pragmatic than peta”: not a concept one meets often. i think the clean meat hoax people have something in common with the opponents of vaping. what really distresses them is that after all their years of exhortations to make the smokers or meat eaters repent, the jammy bastards might be enabled to cease doing the bad thing just like that, with no redeeming pain. january 19th, 2020 | 41 comments - (comments are closed) two snapshots of our times natalie solent (essex) · arts & entertainment · civil liberty & regulation · education & academia · mindless "inequality" blather · sexuality · uk affairs 1) eurogamer reports, pc specialist ad banned for perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes an advert for a bespoke pc retailer was banned for perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes of women. the tv ad, below, for uk retailer pc specialist, begins with a computer exploding, then shows three men getting excited over using a pc specialist pc for gaming, making music and coding. […] the advertising standards authority received eight complaints from people who said the ad perpetuated harmful gender stereotypes by depicting men in roles that were stereotypically male, and implied it was only men who were interested in technology and computers. pc specialist responded to the watchdog to say its customer base was 87.5 per cent male, aged between 15 and 35 years, and “their product, branding and service had been developed for and aimed at that target audience and the characters in the ad therefore represented a cross-section of the pc specialist core customer base”. ten years ago the advertising standards authority would have said something like, “we just want you to stop portraying women as laughably incompetent at computers until a man helps them. surely that’s fair? after all, some women are great at computers.” at that time it must have seemed ridiculous to make a fuss about freedom of speech when faced with such a reasonable request. but when the beast is fed it grows stronger. 2) and from the bbc: sheffield students paid to tackle racist language on campus a university is to hire 20 of its own students to challenge language on campus that could be seen as racist. the university of sheffield is to pay students to tackle so-called “microaggressions” – which it describes as “subtle but offensive comments”. they will be trained to “lead healthy conversations” about preventing racism on campus and in student accommodation. vice-chancellor koen lamberts said the initiative wanted to “change the way people think about racism”. the students will be paid £9.34 per hour as “race equality champions”, working between two and nine hours per week to tackle “microaggressions” in the university. these are described as comments or actions which might be unintentional, but which can cause offence to a minority group. it gives examples of what it means by microaggression – such as: “stop making everything a race issue” “why are you searching for things to be offended about?” “where are you really from?” “i don’t want to hear about your holiday to south africa. it’s nowhere near where i’m from” “being compared to black celebrities that i look nothing like” rather than being about controlling people’s speech, the university says it is “opening up a conversation”. judging from the first two examples, they are allowed to open the conversation but you are not allowed to close it. january 14th, 2020 | 25 comments - (comments are closed) older entries » who are we? the samizdata people are a bunch of sinister and heavily armed globalist illuminati who seek to infect the entire world with the values of personal liberty and several property. amongst our many crimes is a sense of humour and the intermittent use of british spelling. we are also a varied group made up of social individualists, classical liberals, whigs, libertarians, extropians, futurists, ‘porcupines’, karl popper fetishists, recovering neo-conservatives, crazed ayn rand worshipers, over-caffeinated virginia postrel devotees, witty frédéric bastiat wannabes, cypherpunks, minarchists, kritarchists and wild-eyed anarcho-capitalists from britain, north america, australia and europe. categories categories select category ~ glossary categories (114) a (2) b (28) c (7) d (3) e (4) f (5) g (2) h (1) i (3) j (1) k (4) l (6) m (12) n (1) o (1) p (9) r (5) s (6) t (7) v (1) w (5) x (1) ~ meme hacks categories (14) detournement (3) evil empire (5) hippopotami (1) propaganda (5) ~ photos #1 categories (8) ~ photos #2 categories (11) ~ photos #3 categories (2) ~ white rose categories (667) activism (17) administrative (9) big brother (43) biometrics (40) civil liberties (103) constitution (6) european union (45) events (5) historical perspective (27) identity cards (168) liberty (16) privacy (95) security (17) self-defence (5) self-ownership (8) slogans & quotations (21) surveillance (98) technology (50) abortion (14) activism (244) administrative (132) aerospace & astronautics (541) afghanistan (80) african affairs (187) anglosphere (134) antics & parties (152) architecture (86) arts & entertainment (919) asian affairs (268) aus/nz affairs (130) balkans (44) best of samizdata.net (82) blogging & bloggers (535) book reviews (145) children’s issues (121) chinese affairs (21) civil liberty & regulation (1,075) deleted by the pc media (48) eastern europe (128) economics, business & globalization (1,698) education & academia (336) environment (236) european affairs (383) european union (780) events (117) french affairs (263) german affairs (83) health & medical (378) hippos (19) historical views (721) how very odd!
