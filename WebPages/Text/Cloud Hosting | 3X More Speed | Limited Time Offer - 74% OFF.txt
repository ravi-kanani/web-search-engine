at hostinger , we use cloudlinux with lve containers. each account gets a dedicated container and is served from there. each container has resource boundaries to make sure the host stays healthy at all times (even if, one of the accounts is under a ddos attack). in case the host needs to be put down, the account with its container can be easily migrated to a different host, to avoid unnecessary downtime. our shared hosting accounts share hosts between several customers, whereas our cloud hosting clients are served solely from the host, meaning that only their accounts are put in the whole host. can i upgrade from shared hosting to cloud hosting? if you have a shared web hosting plan on hostinger, upgrading to cloud hosting is extremely simple. all you have to do is order an upgrade from the control panel, and everything will be migrated automatically! the main difference between two is that cloud hosting plan provides you with dedicated resources and the ability to manage them as you see fit. meanwhile shared hosting typically hosts multiple servers on one dedicated machine and requires the user to share resources with other servers on the machine. how many websites can i host with a cloud hosting package? you can host up to 300 websites. and if you ever need more, we got your back! what if i need assistance? since cloud hosting is fully managed, you’ll have a dedicated support team ready to help with all your needs 24/7/365. hosting web hosting vps hosting cloud hosting wordpress hosting email hosting cms hosting ecommerce hosting free website hosting website builder cheap web hosting buy hosting windows vps minecraft server hosting web design services domains domain checker domain transfer free domain xyz domain cheap ssl certificate buy domain name whois checker domain name search 99 cent domains free ssl certificate information server status affiliate program payment methods wall of love reviews student discount pricing youtube creators our mission is to make life easier for website developers and their customers. we do it by offering easy to use, fast and reliable web hosting services. and more help report abuse knowledge base tutorials blog company about hostinger contact us our technology career legal privacy policy terms of service © 2004-2020 hostinger.com - premium web hosting, cloud, vps & domain registration services. prices are listed without vat
