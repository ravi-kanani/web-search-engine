(martin is evidently serious about criminal-justice reform: on “ellen” last week, he presented ellen degeneres with a copy of michelle alexander’s book “the new jim crow,” telling the host, “it’s all about how too many people are in prison.”) the gig was part of coldplay’s socal staycation in support of “everyday life,” which uses textures from africa and the middle east to punch up songs about gun violence and police brutality. when the album came out in november, martin told the bbc that the group had decided not to travel the world until it could figure out how to do so in an environmentally sustainable fashion. × you have run out of free articles. you can support our newsroom by joining at our lowest rate! already a subscriber?
