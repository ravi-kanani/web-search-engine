reply rc says: march 11, 2020 at 8:20 am “don’t be selective. refuse to do all things that won’t get you immediately fired.” reply kenny says: march 11, 2020 at 8:45 am i think this especially applies to work situations as long as it won’t get you fired. the goal is to become comfortable saying no to people who constantly add more to your plate. and learning to say no to a boss or colleagues sets boundaries and puts you on the path to freeing up more time. reply mary pat kanaley says: march 11, 2020 at 8:22 am instead of saying your sorry, just say “it’s not possible, or i can’t, thanks for understanding”. it is amazing how push back drops. reply heatherly21 says: march 11, 2020 at 8:33 am no! reply vincent says: march 11, 2020 at 8:48 am no reply joanna free says: march 11, 2020 at 1:43 pm hahahaha @heatherly21 – that was going to be my first response, but you got there first! reply melissa says: march 11, 2020 at 10:01 am i’m at work and took two plus minutes to watch this. as i unplugged and the screen was still up, my secretary asked, “can i bother you for a second.” i turned and looked and said – “no.” i immediately went back to working. if you could have seen her face! this is going to be an extremely difficult challenge. i will report back in after two days. reply janet says: march 19, 2020 at 5:06 pm good to remember that many of us will be dealing with the people we’re saying “no” to long after this challenge is over. although i’m all about the whole “shifting the monkey” trap of taking on others’ responsibilities, if someone asks if they can talk to me, i will more likely give them the same response i do now and ask if they can shoot me a text or email. gives me a chance to decide if i can help or to decline with a brief, but kind, refusal. this is also easier on the asker who isn’t put off by the awkwardness of the short shrift. reply scott d says: march 11, 2020 at 10:19 am i get that we all need to say no sometimes. that we can over commit with yes. but, no is a negative and limiting response. want to learn something new? no. want to achieve something great? no. saying yes, while perhaps opening too many doors, does give an open response to opportunity. obviously, i am cool on the challenge. but. i will commit to being more intentional with my yes or no responses. reply ilona says: march 11, 2020 at 11:03 am hi tim, i am a fan of your podcasts , they are inspiring and very true! right now i am in the middle of reading “4 hour workweek” , it has a great number of fascinating and incredible challenges!! thank you for them , ‘cause they just remind me that everything is much more easier then we think! today’s challenge is to contact a top person! i would like to contact you for just a few minutes, i promise it won’t take much time. i would like to ask you just one question as now i am in the process of writing my own book, the question is – how did you choose what stories from your life should be written in the book “4 hour workweek”? thank you for advance for your time! reply lidia says: march 16, 2020 at 12:48 pm ehm. so.. the objective of this post is to say no to anything. and exactly this post is the one you choose to ask for something. interesting. sarah fryer says: march 11, 2020 at 4:34 pm as a parent, this might be challenging to say no to my kids, too😆 but i can provide their basic needs and say no to the rest for a couple of days! or say “no” to cuddles and cuddle anyway 😁 reply robin turner says: march 11, 2020 at 11:01 am “i really can’t do this challenge—i’ve got too much on my plate right now” reply psilo says: march 11, 2020 at 11:01 am do you have a minute to read about my trippy psilocybin experience? 😉 hope the weeks goin’ well. reply mannan javid says: march 11, 2020 at 11:04 am ways to say no: – i really can’t sorry – i have too much on my plate right now – i’ve made a lot of commitments, i’m over calendared – i’m trying to take on my current commitments before i take on anything new as a policy (policy’s make it harder for people to challenge) the goal here is to focus on the process for two days, not so much trying to find intricate amazing things to say no to. just say no to as much as possible (including to the guy’s boss that someone mentioned below). reply john says: march 11, 2020 at 11:51 am i wish i’d seen this before i said “yes” to hrape in ayahuasca ceremony last saturday… i can’t. sorry. too much in my bucket already. reply wendy says: march 11, 2020 at 12:17 pm when i retired, i was overwhelmed with requests for my time and talents. i decided to say no to all requests for the first year. after a lifetime of working within the establishment, i wanted the luxury of being on a schedule that i controlled and determined. this is the advice i give to anyone i know who is retiring. of course as a woman, mother, teacher, dog owner, etc, no was a easy word to come out of my mouth. in turn, i have also never accepted the word no, being told to me. no can be very empowering when you say it, but not so much when you hear it. reply sarah says: march 11, 2020 at 1:20 pm want to meet my mum in law to reconcile an awkward relationship. emm, no! reply that phoenix girl says: march 11, 2020 at 1:24 pm i said no to my trip to california so that said no to my 1st guided trip. i said no to my trip next week to go see my amazing son in d. c. i’ve also said no to all gatherings outside my house except for my daily walk in nature. it’s super easy to say no because i’m immuno-compromised. i wish the rest of the world would give themselves permission to say no right now for all non-essential contact with others. it would sure help curb the spread of #coronavirus reply joanna free says: march 11, 2020 at 1:41 pm hi tim, i’d love to offer you some rich feedback on this inspiring post and exercise, and to share my delighted experience of it, though (in spite of my no’s) my day is filled with other opportunities for connection. however, if you’d like to have me on the blog, i think we could make it a win for everyone involved. please – do feel free to say no;) joanna niccitina free reply imaginativesag says: march 11, 2020 at 2:15 pm i really like this challenge. some years ago i starting practicing saying ‘no’ and feeling comfortable doing so but it is a nice opportunity to concentrate on this challenge during the next 2 days and see if i am really doing this 🙂 reply lucian ionita says: march 11, 2020 at 3:19 pm someone: tim, can you post challenge #3? tim: no, sorry, i’ve got too much on my plate. reply gregg says: march 12, 2020 at 3:11 am i’ve mastered the art of saying no over my lifetime. my girlfriend asks me to deal with pushy store attendants when shopping because i feel nothing to say no and without explanation. in business and in all aspects of life i’m also completely comfortable saying no. when people ask why i simply say because i don’t want to or it doesn’t work for me. don’t complicate your reasons i reckon. my friends don’t question me anymore when i say no. they realize there is nothing to it. reply kai.koßert says: march 12, 2020 at 3:22 am hello mr.ferris, my name is kai i‘am 23 from germany. i write you on linked.in, twitter mails are to short. i am sorry. i read the tfhw multiple times and it confirmed my thinking about life. long story short, all my ideas we’re implemented by people with more possibility’s. my question is, what could i do to find my muse? i’m depressed and very afraid about my future. i really don’t want to work in a regular job and spend all my life in dissatisfaction. i went back to school, just for getting permission to study in a university. i was thinking, this plan would generate time to spend it on self-realization. thank you for being such an idol. please excuse my bad english, i hope you could understand my issue and respond me. greetings kai koßert reply david a davis says: march 12, 2020 at 12:24 pm covid link: https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca very interesting and informative. reply booklover says: march 15, 2020 at 8:25 am imagine everyone on the world would start doing the challenge at the same time … reply post navigation previous postprevious the tim ferriss show transcripts: the random show — new year’s resolutions, 2010–2019 lessons learned, finding joy, energy management, and much more (#408) next postnext jack kornfield — how to find peace amidst covid-19, how to cultivate calm in chaos (#414) join 1.5m+ subscribers and receive exclusive tools, tips, and resources directly from tim: type your email address yes, sign me up for tim's free email newsletter. i agree to the privacy policy. get access twitter instagram facebook youtube linkedin click to subscribe apple podcasts spotify overcast popular podcasts brené brown — striving versus self-acceptance, saving marriages, and more (#409) how to support healthcare workers now — plus urgent suggestions for uber eats, hilton, amazon, and more (#416) jack kornfield — how to find peace amidst covid-19, how to cultivate calm in chaos (#414) the top 25 episodes of the tim ferriss show from 2019 most popular in comfort challenges comfort challenge #1: learn to eye gaze comfort challenge #2: learn to propose comfort challenge #4: revisit the terrible twos comfort challenge #5: use the criticism sandwich topics 30-day challenges (2) 4-hour case studies (50) automation (7) comfort challenges (4) dance (3) e-mail detox (23) entrepreneurship (60) fearless (2) filling the void (93) gadgets (15) geoarbitrage (8) interviews (29) investing (18) language (16) low-information diet (42) marketing (54) mental performance (42) mini-retirements (24) muse examples (9) nonsense (5) opening the kimono – otk (4) outsourcing life (17) physical performance (51) practical philosophy (39) presentations (3) protecting time (14) psychedelics (14) quarterly shipments (3) random (29) remote offices (7) rockstar living in… (5) rust and iron (2) science (5) the 4-hour body – 4hb (48) the 4-hour chef – 4hc (39) the 4-hour chef recipes (1) the book – 4hww (44) the slow-carb diet (4) the tim ferriss experiment – tfx (11) the tim ferriss show (394) the tim ferriss show transcripts (256) tim ferriss book club (6) tools of titans (8) travel (67) tribe of mentors (10) writing and blogging (35) books by tim ferriss the 4-hour workweek the 4-hour body the 4-hour chef tools of titans tribe of mentors we use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it. see our cookie policy here. sitemap site terms of service privacy policy copyright © 2007–2020 tim ferriss. the 4-hour® is a registered trademark of tim ferriss. all rights reserved. privacy policy proudly powered by wordpress | hosted by pressable send to email address your name your email address cancel post was not sent - check your email addresses! email check failed, please try again sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.
