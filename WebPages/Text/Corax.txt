power to the search for extraterrestial life, reasons include diminishing returns and need to focus more on analyzing the results already achieved largest explosion ever observed came from supermassive black hole in galaxy cluster ophiuchus 390 million lightyears from earth, according to researches who studied it using four radio telescopes including two in orbit, one i australia and one in india two distinct forms of schizophrenia exists and are associated with different changes in brain structure, one with lower volume of grey matter and the other with increased volumes in some structure but normal volume overall, according to researches who studied 307 schizophrenics and 364 healthy subjects with magnetic resonance imaging covid-19 stimulates new culture of research where results are published faster and more researchers collaborate, central roles are played by prepublishing services like biorxiv and medrxiv as well as communication platforms like slack and twitter

method for identifying genetic overlap, africans got neanderthal genes due to migration from europe study shows ambient lighting modulates fatty acid secretion within fat cells, infrequent exposure to full-spectrum light leads to increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome among mice, whether the same mechanism obtains for human metabolism is yet to be determined cerebral cortex not as
