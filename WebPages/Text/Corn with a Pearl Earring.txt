(via colossal) update: this is fun (courtesy of @jschulenklopper): in dutch (vermeer’s native language) this one is even better. the original painting is called “meisje met de parel” in dutch, and corn is “mais”. so this one could be named “maisje met de parel” which is pronounced almost identically. more about... art johannes vermeer nanan kang remix ads via carbon kottke.org, loving you since 1998homeaboutarchives + tagsshopmembership! homeaboutarchivesshopmembership! homeaboutarchives
