uncle in 1833. the success of the company was crucial to him who began targeting foreign markets as early as then. the russians were particularly fascinated by the roederer champagne. however, the unrest in russia made it unsafe for alexander ii russia’s emperor to enjoy the wine; he feared assassination. as a result, he requested this famous wine making company to make special prestige cuvee packaged in crystal clear bottles instead of ordinary glass for his three emperors dinner. the idea was to prevent his enemies from hiding bombs beneath the bottles as it was possible with the previous dark green indented bottles. it was then that the name cristal was formed. louis roederer asked a flemish glassmaker to make champagne bottles made of lead glass with flat bottoms. while the champagne was introduced in 1876, it only became commercially available in 1945. apart from the use of crystal clear bottles, louis spent a lot of time developing a unique character and taste for the wine. it was this quest to produce the best wine in the region that caused louis to acquire some vineyards from champagne grande cru. this approach was rather different from trading practices at the time because most other winemaking companies preferred buying grapes. louis understood that, if he could nurture his vineyards, then it was easy to produce wine with the desired taste, character and style. he believed that the quality of the soil greatly affected the quality of wine produced. this gave him an edge over other wine houses as the flagship champagne dominated foreign markets in the united states and russia in the 1870s. today, the winemaking plant sits on a 240-hectare piece of land providing two-thirds of the grapes required for production. the remaining one-third of the grapes are purchased from established farms. the 1920s saw leon olry-roederer, luois’s heir introduce, brut premier, a highly balanced wine that comprised of a mixture of several vintages; 20% of pinot meunier, 40 % of pinot noir and 40% of chardonnay. it was this wine that contributed to the rebirth of the house of louis roederer house. louis died in 1933, leaving the management of the winery to his widow camille. her grandson, jean-claude rouzaud, then took over the management of the estate. the company remains a family-owned business passed on from one generation to another and reports total exports of up to three million bottles around the world every year. wines produced brut premier it was produced after the first world war that destroyed more than half of the estate. at this time, leon olryroederer was in charge and was left with the difficult task of reconstructing the vineyards. since the reconstruction process would take a long time, leon decided to buy grapes to ensure continuity of the winemaking process. it was during this period that the brut premier, which was a multi-vintage blend of other wines; pinot noir, pinot meunier and chardonnay, was produced. brut is made of wine that has been matured in oak tuns from three champagne grape varieties. the wine is aged for three years in cellars and another six months after disgorging. it is this winemaking process that gives the brut premier its characteristic balance of an aged and youthful taste. the wine also features the round and complex structure common in most vintage wines made by the company.
