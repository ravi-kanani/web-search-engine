petite anglaise december 24, 2008 hiatus interruptus filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 4:34 pm okay, i admit it. i’ve been “on a break”. i’m not going to apologise, or offer a bouquet of excuses. i happen to think that when you find you’ve run out of things to say or temporarily lost the desire to say them to the world at large, then it’s best to simply hold your tongue for a while. i would however like to take a break from my break and wish everyone who has followed petite anglaise online and/or enjoyed the book (in any language) a very happy holiday season. i will be back in early 2009, not least to remind you of the impending arrival of petite in paperback as of february 5th (see sidebar right), and of the publication of my first novel, rendez-vous, hot on petite’s heels in august 2009… comments (61) search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com. post to cancel
