(i recently learned why cats destroy furniture in the most prominent and difficult to conceal areas of our furniture. read to the end to end to find out why!). having reupholstered my beloved chaise lounge once many years ago, it was painfully evident that intervention was needed once again. not wanting to spend the cash on reupholstery, i was excited when the folks at cat friendly sofa reached out to me about their tailor made anti-scratch sofa covers. cat friendly sofa was started in 2014 by lusine manukyan (a fellow armenian – woot!) and her husband luigi delfino who reside in putignano, italy. as parents to five cats, they understood a cat’s desire to scratch was natural and served several purposes (i love that they discuss the reasons cats scratch on their website in an effort to educate). knowing declawing wasn’t an option, they saw the need for a product that would accommodate their cats natural behavior without jeopardizing their furniture. luigi with frittella (left) and plume (right) on-the-job doing quality control they took a great deal of time in research and development taking into consideration cat scratching behavior and testing various types of materials in order to find one that’s 100% cat proof. and now they make custom covers for various kinds of furniture to cat loving clients around the world. for custom covers, you just take measurements and pick a color! lusine and luigi are happy their product facilitates adoptions (not to mention keeping cat’s claws intact!). they also support gatto randagio onlus, a non-profit organization that takes care of abandoned cats in northern italy, encouraging those who visit their site to donate 1 euro (about $1.25usd) to the group so they can continue their good works. to get a quote, check out the cat friendly sofa website or email info@catfriendlysofa.com. given the durability of the fabric, it is a bit stiff, so you may want to consider only covering the areas your cats scratch the most opposed to the entire piece of furniture. kip and haddie enjoying the finished product so, why do cats always scratch furniture in the most obvious places (the arms and never the back of the sofa)? it turns out that in the wild, cats mark their territory by scratching prominent landmarks (like large trees) to make sure cats in the area get their message loud and clear. so it only makes sense they do the same thing in our homes. what’s the point if nobody sees it! does your cat have a preferred piece of furniture to scratch? tell us about it in the comment section. i think kip’s is pretty obvious! this entry was posted in cats and tagged cat scratching, catification, decorating with cats. bookmark the permalink. ← in memoriam: to my sweet, soulful petie (2006-2016) comments are closed. find i have cat on: check out my first book today! about i have cat tamar began "i have cat" as a way to chronicle her life as a 30-something nyc singleton looking for love despite the complication of owning cat (s). read about how it all began>> search for: visit our fab sponsors! advertise with me! subscribe by email! enter your email address: we’re talking about… 9/11 advertising advocacy cat accessories cat art cat book cat books cat cafe catification cat lady cat man cat man monday cat men catnip cat photography cats cat toy cat toys cat woman cat woman wednesday celebrity cat christmas crazy cat lady dating decorating with cats food foster cats giveaway guest post holiday gift guide humor lists men mother's day new york new york city nyc relationships reviews single tamar valentine valentines day vegan wine blogroll it's martini time cat versus human love meow my himalayan cat goma freya cat crafting with cat hair moderncat sparkle tabby's place – felis catus under cover kitty riverfront cats, downtown miami modcatlove recent posts decorating with cats: cat friendly sofa in memoriam: to my sweet, soulful petie (2006-2016) in his words: kip’s first interview the cone by wiski: a modern cat scratcher & bed cats in film: 2016 kedi: much more than a film about cats in istanbul i had my bachelorette party…at a cat cafe advocacy blogroll blind cat rescue city critters rikki's refuge tabby's place tiny timmy archives archives select month march 2018 july 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 © 2020 - i have cat
