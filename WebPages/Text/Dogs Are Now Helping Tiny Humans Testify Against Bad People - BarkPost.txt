how are they trained and what do they do? courthouse dogs are professionally trained facility dogs that have graduated from an accredited service dog organization. they assist crime victims and witnesses during criminal investigations and trials. while they do provide support, facility dogs are not service dogs. they do not assist people with disabilities or have public access. instead, they assist professionals by enhancing the quality of their work. a courthouse dog’s handler is a working professional in the criminal field. check out the video below to learn more about these awesome puppers: to learn more about the standards and training of courthouse dogs visit courthousedogs.org h/t the washington post featured image via courthouse dogs comments want to read more stories?
