you see i rent server space on hostrocket who’ve generally been very good about support issues. at the moment what we’re faced with is the fact that someone else on the server is using mysql as backing store for their webpages – or some other activity that presumably could not have been done by anything so mundane as a “filesystem” – and thus the load-average every few minutes spikes to some incredible number: 17:31:01 up 9:57, 3 users, load average: 23.49, 18.92, 22.75 17:31:18 up 9:57, 3 users, load average: 36.38, 22.10, 23.72 17:31:31 up 9:57, 3 users, load average: 43.29, 24.05, 24.33 17:31:44 up 9:57, 3 users, load average: 63.72, 30.37, 26.42 17:33:14 up 9:59, 2 users, load average: 81.13, 46.58, 32.61 …causing my (at least) piddling little cgi script to fail, because the process table is full; the logfiles are showing: [error] (11)resource temporarily unavailable: exec of cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi failed …where “11” equates to eagain, the unix error code that i’ve always found most disappointing. of course this only afflicts cgi content, the static stuff seems to be serving up pretty well. hostrocket have installed a watchdog-style cronjob to monitor for this situation, but it tends to run into problems when the process table fills up; personally i’d slap a fair-share scheduler and process ulimits on all the users – in fact, going down the solaris route i would put them all in zones – but i am not in a position to suggest what hostrocket will be doing to control this in future. this had been getting progressively more common since december, and it’s ironic that this peaks on the day that i get small links to my wesite from both schneier and slashdot. hohum. i’ve asked to be relocated to a different server, and will let you know what happens. share this post: click to share on twitter (opens in new window) click to share on facebook (opens in new window) click to share on reddit (opens in new window) click to share on whatsapp (opens in new window) more click to share on linkedin (opens in new window) click to share on pocket (opens in new window) click to share on telegram (opens in new window) click to share on pinterest (opens in new window) click to share on skype (opens in new window) click to email this to a friend (opens in new window) click to share on tumblr (opens in new window) click to print (opens in new window) categoriesuncategorised leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website post navigation previous postprevious thought for the day… next postnext 159mph pc’s acquittal overturned recent posts how to use rsync on a mac / macos to sync files with a locally mounted fat32 disk, and deal sensibly with unicode characters, umlauts, accents, etc. 2019/07/14 installing a mkcert certificate into tor browser 2019/05/05 dark web vs: deep web – 2018 edition 2018/12/20 irony is a dish best served cold 2018/09/21 test image 2018/07/02 recent comments alec muffett on how to use rsync on a mac / macos to sync files with a locally mounted fat32 disk, and deal sensibly with unicode characters, umlauts, accents, etc. howard brazee on wanted: fix for “itunes has stopped updating this podcast because…” wendy m. grossman on dark web vs: deep web – 2018 edition david cant on portrait of a catholic boys’ school michael cant on portrait of a catholic boys’ school about dropsafe is the personal blog of alec muffett with occasional contributions from friends & guest bloggers;
