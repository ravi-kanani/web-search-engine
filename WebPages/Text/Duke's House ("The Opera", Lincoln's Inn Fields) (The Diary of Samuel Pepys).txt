portugal street in lincoln's inn fields in london. originally built as a real tennis court, it was used as a playhouse during two periods, 1661–1674 and 1695–1705. during the early period, the theatre was called lincoln's inn fields playhouse, also known as the duke's playhouse, the new theatre or the opera. the building was demolished and replaced by a purpose-built theatre for a third period, 1714–1728. the tennis court theatre was the first public playhouse in london to feature the moveable scenery that would become a standard feature of restoration theatres. contents 1 historical

interregnum, meaning "between kings." at this time, there was no monarch on the throne, and theatre was against the law. spanning from 1642 to 1649, the english civil war occurred. this war was an uprising against the current king of england, king charles i, led by oliver cromwell, a puritan. cromwell's opposition to the throne was religious but political, as well, which led him to build up an army with the ability to imprison king charles, who was beheaded in 1649, ending the war. after his death, the king's wife and children were given permission to leave the country, so they travelled to france to escape and receive protection. the years following became known as the commonwealth era (1649-1660) because cromwell, who established himself as the monarch figure without assuming any official authority, ruled the nation with parliament support and renamed the england republic to the english commonwealth. these were tough times for england as cromwell persecuted many families, especially those who fought on the behalf of king charles i and irish families that held rustic catholic beliefs. needless to say, oliver cromwell quickly fell out of the majority's favour, and he died in 1658 of natural causes. two years later, charles ii, the beheaded king's son, returned to england and began the restoration by restoring the throne and claiming his role as the proper king of england. in addition, king charles ii's return restored the legality of theatre. this history is significant because it explains that since charles ii spent most of his life in france, he, as king, appreciated french culture, which prominently impressed upon england during the restoration, particularly restoration theatre. structure there are no extant photos, elaborate diagrams, paintings, or other forms of visual evidence of the inside of the lincoln's inn theatre, but certain aspects are understood of the theatre according to its time period. however, a great example of the layout of the inside is the theatre royal in richmond, england, which contains components of restoration theatre spaces and still stands today. lincoln's inn fields playhouse was very small. in fact, milhous believes that "the smaller seating capacity… hurt the [duke’s] company in the long run" as they moved as newer theatres came along (milhous 71). it was around 75 feet long by 30 feet wide with about a 650-person audience seating maximum capacity (the restoration theater; wilson and goldfarb 249). it was originally an indoor tennis court; courts were used as theatre spaces because they had a similar structure with a narrow, rectangular shape and gallery seating. the stage was raked, sloping upward toward the back of the stage, in order to help with perspective. the audience was divided into the pit, boxes, and galleries. the pit had backless benches and a raked floor that rose toward the back of the audience to help sightlines. mostly single men sat here, and it was the noisiest, rowdiest area in the theatre. boxes sat upper class aristocrats—mostly married couples with wives who wanted to be seen. galleries held the lower class, including servants of the upper classes in attendance. the english stage, unlike french or italian theatres, had a very deep apron to provide adequate acting space, and the background and perspective scenery served as solely as scenery. the lincoln's inn fields playhouse orchestra was housed beneath the stage, and the apron was extended two feet to cover completely the orchestra pit and obtain close proximity between the actors and the audience, creating an intimate atmosphere. another uniqueness of english theatres is that there were typically two pairs of doors, one on each side of the stage, called proscenium doors with balconies above them for the actors to utilize in performances. proscenium doors served as entrances and exits disregarding the possibility of multiple locations. candelabras provided light for the space, and manual moveable scenery was used to move the show along (the restoration theater). the duke's company the building was constructed as a real tennis court in 1656. thomas lisle's wife anne tyler and a man named james hooker developed the indoor court in the winter of 1656 and 1657.[1] tudor-style real tennis courts were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions — about 75 by 30 feet — are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than a modern tennis court.[2] after the english restoration in 1660, lincoln's inn fields playhouse received its first company through the efforts of the king himself and two men who dedicated themselves to theatre. sir william davenant had received a patent from charles the i in 1639 when he was in power, but he had never used it due to the theatre ban. when theatre was restored, davenant and a man named thomas killigrew wanted to create theatre in england and thus, killigrew obtained a warrant expressing that he could "raise a company and a theatre, provided that his company and davenant’s should be the only ones allowed to play in london" (hotson 199). davenant, then, drafted their joint warrant and after much debate over whether or not their role in theatre infringed on the master of the revels’ power, they appealed to charles ii. charles ii determined their letters of patent were valid and created two companies to perform "legitimate drama" in london: the duke's company of his brother, the duke of york, led by william davenant, and his company, the king's company, led by thomas killigrew. original intentions were positive, but competition was quickly apparent between the two. both companies briefly performed in the theatrical spaces that had survived the interregnum and civil war (including the cockpit and salisbury court), but scrambled to quickly acquire facilities that were more to current tastes. taking a hint from their new king's taste, killigrew and davenant both chose a solution that had been used in france: converting tennis courts into theatres. in march 1660, sir william davenant contracted to lease lisle's tennis court in order to renovate it into a theatre, and he bought adjoining land to expand the building into the garden area. killigrew's theatre on vere street (gibbon's tennis court) opened first, in november 1660. davenant apparently spent more time in his remodelling: lincoln's inn fields opened on 28 june 1661, with the first "moveable" or "changeable" scenery used on the british public stage, and the first proscenium arch. wings or shutters ran in grooves and could be smoothly and mechanically changed between or even within acts. the production was a revamped version of davenant's own five-year-old opera the siege of rhodes where the soon-to-be famous actor, thomas betterton, performed the prologue.[3] the result was such a sensation that it brought charles ii to a public theatre for the first time.[4] this production at lincoln's inn fields playhouse "emptied killigrew’s theatre" according to milhous (19). milhous also explains that the companies and other theatres "deliberately engaged in vicious head-on collision[s], mounting the same plays" (19). the competing king's company suddenly found itself playing to empty houses, as diarist and devoted playgoer samuel pepys notes on 4 july: i went to the theatre [in vere street] and there i saw claracilla (the first time i ever saw it), well acted. but strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun—and so will continue for a while i believe.[5] the siege of rhodes "continued acting 12 days without interruption with great applause" according to the prompter john downes in his "historical review of the stage" roscius anglicanus (1708). this was a remarkable run for the limited potential audience of the time. more acclaimed productions by the duke's company "with scenes" followed at lincoln's inn fields in the course of 1661 (including hamlet and twelfth night), all highly admired by pepys.[6] the king's company was forced to abandon their own, technically unsophisticated tennis-court theatre and commission the construction of a new theatre in bridges street, where the theatre royal opened in 1663. prince cosimo iii of tuscany visited the lisle theatre in 1669, and his official diarist left us this account: [the pit] is surrounded within by separate compartments in which there are several degrees [steps] of seating for the greater comfort of the ladies and gentlemen who, according to the liberal custom of the country, share the same boxes. down below [in the pit] there remains a broad space for other members of the audience. the scenery is entirely changeable, with various transformations and lovely perspectives. before the play begins, to render the waiting less annoying and inconvenient, there are very graceful instrumental pieces to be heard, with the result that many go early just to enjoy this part of the entertainment.[7] thomas betterton painted by sir godfrey kneller. the theatre was implicated by the grand jury of middlesex on 7 july 1703 for showcasing "profane, irrelevant, lewd, indecent, and immoral expressions". it was also a hot target for riots and disorderly assemblies, murders, and other misdemeanors, but despite its troubles, the theatre remained very popular including hosting the first paid performance of purcell's dido and aeneas in 1700 and handel's final two operas (pedicord 41). davenant died in 1668 and the duke's company, now under thomas betterton, performed out of lincoln's inns fields until 1671, when they relocated to the elaborate new dorset garden theatre which was more popular at the time. in 1672, the theatre in bridges street burnt down, and the king's company temporarily occupied the recently vacated lincoln's inn field, until their new theatre opened in 1674. betterton and rich the building was converted back to a tennis court and remained one for almost 20 years. during that time, the duke's company, occupying the dorset theatre, subsumed the king's company, housed in the newly rebuilt theatre royal, to form the united company, performing out of drury lane. betterton, a famous english actor, was forced out as the head of the company in 1688, staying on as an actor (and filling a day-to-day managerial role) while a succession of leaders embezzled funds and cut costs by cutting actors' salaries. this uniting created many conflicts between the members of the companies. for example, each company would have one actor who would always play hamlet, but when the companies are combined, who claims the role? due to rivalry and competition within the united company, thomas betterton petitioned to the king to separate and create his own company. so, under christopher rich, the united company split. betterton left with a band of actors and a newly issued license to perform, and from 1695 to 1705 his company performed back at lincoln's inn fields playhouse, refurbishing the abandoned building back into a theatre. the new theatre in lincoln's inn fields opened in april 1695 with william congreve's love for love.[8] it was later the first venue for congreve's plays the mourning bride (1697) and the way of the world (1700). the building went unused as a theatre from 1705 until it was demolished in 1714 or shortly before, in preparation to build a new theatre. the man behind the new construction was none other than christopher rich, who after 16 years of management, had been pushed out of drury lane. rich died in 1714, but his son john rich led a company at the theatre until 1728. on 29 january 1728, rich's theatre hosted the first, very successful, production of john gay's the beggar's opera (making "rich gay and gay rich"). the theatre was finally abandoned in december 1732, when the company moved to the new covent garden theatre, built by rich using the capital generated by the beggar's opera.[14] the old building was used as a barracks, an auction room, a warehouse for china, and was finally demolished in 1848 to make room for an extension to the neighbouring premises of the royal college of surgeons.[15][16] references ^ hartnoll. portions available online. ^ styan p. 238. ^ pepys first records attending "the opera" on its fourth day of opening, to watch the second half of the

(both theatres seem to have been built on tennis courts!) brian's map link above would seem to be the "duke's house." king's house (theatre royal, vere st): http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1611/ ✹ bill on 16 nov 2015 • link davenant's company, called from being under the patronage of the duke of york, the duke's company, began to play at salisbury court theatre on november 15th, 1660. the company removed to portugal row, lincoln's inn fields, in june, 1661. davenant's theatre is usually called the opera, to distinguish it from the theatre of the king's company. ---wheatley, 1893. log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1661 jul 2 4 aug 15 17 23 24 sep 11 oct 21 23 25 nov 4 15 25 27 dec 2 4 5 16 1662 feb 18 mar 1 apr 1 2 may 20 23 sep 30 oct 20 dec 26 27 1663 jan 1 6 8 17 feb 23 may 28 29 jun 13 dec 10 22 1664 jan 1 mar 7 apr 15 jul 20 aug 13 sep 10 nov 5 dec 2 1665 jan 4 13 apr 3 17 1666 apr 17 oct 25 nov 14 dec 26 28 1667 jan 5 7 22 24 feb 4 12 13 18 20 mar 7 21 apr 18 19 20 may 21 jul 22 aug 5 15 16 19 20 sep 4 5 11 12 25 28 oct 5 14 15 16 24 nov 7 13 dec 12 1668 jan 1 6 7 11 14 feb 1 3 6 11 22 mar 25 26 apr 3 8 9 25 29 30 may 2 4 5 7 11 12 22 31 jun 24 jul 6 28 aug 5 12 17 29 30 31 sep 10 oct 19 nov 25 dec 3 8 9 21 26 30 1669 jan 7 15 18 20 21 27 feb 1 18 20 23 25 mar 3 apr 14 16 may 7 12 maps see all places in this category on one map latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
