in all honesty? here’s the breakdown of our weekly dinners: 15% blog recipes 85% sushi takeout except do i look like i’m kidding right now? we have a little sushi place within super- accessible distance from our house that has become our go-to of all go-tos for a happy, lazy takeout dinner. i haven’t tried this yet, but i am so tempted to order the regular every time i call in our order because we’ve called in at least once a week for the last 52 weeks straight and our order has never changed. 3 dynamite rolls plz! dynamite rolls are where it’s at for us middle-of-the-road sushi people. i mean, good on you, brave sushi souls who buy the raw fish sushi takeout for lunch from those little plastic containers that they sell at fancy grocery stores, but over here in the middle-of-the-road sushi camp we are feeling a little weird about that for some reason (some reason = ummm raw fish) so when we do sushi takeout, we stick with things like the very safe, very regular dynamite rolls. dynamite rolls: the ones with tempura shrimp, avocado, and cucumber rolled in with that sticky white rice and a sheet of roasted seaweed and topped with spicy mayo and roe. the ones that my dreams are made of. no raw fish. tons of flavor and texture. very safe for takeout and perfect for middle-of-the-road sushi-ers and just begging to be adapted into sushi bowls. so this recipe? it’s a healthy bowls + dynamite rolls = sushi bowls and it is my ultimate fave. rather than tempura shrimp or raw tuna or something, we are going for a kind of soy-glazed tofu as the protein of choice because, tbh, ain’t nobody got time to run around to another grocery store to get special sushi fish for a thursday night dinner. no thank u. we can, however, pick up some tofu and splash it with soy sauce, rice vinegar, agave, and garlic and then pan-fry it up to golden perfection so it can be served dynamite-style with cucumber, avocado, carrots, baby micro greens, ginger, brown rice for healthy bonus points, and spicy mayo and sesame seeds on top. gosh, tofu is just so good. just like a dynamite sushi roll, but in the form of sushi bowls, with next level nutrition and, like, previous level skill. note about real sushi: i absolutely don’t want to discourage you from trying to make *real* raw fish sushi at home, especially if you have some kind of sushi wizard in your life to hold your hand and tell you it’s okay as you cut off those little buttery pieces of a raw tuna steak and put them directly in your mouth. ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!!! i know, right? there is no food experience like it, and even the squeamy part of putting the raw fish in your mouth is (i promise you) divinely delicious and will absolutely make you question the meaning of life. but in the end, since practicality remains our close companion for weeknight dinners, we ultimately embrace the fake-out sushi bowls zone. we fry up some tofu, we toss it all in bowls with our favorite sushi friends, and we call these things amazing dynamite plant power sushi bowls. ♡ isn’t food just the best?
