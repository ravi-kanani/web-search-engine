so, this means that this tomato chutney bruschetta recipe only requires fresh basil, spring onions and bread! table of contents tracklements chunky tomato chutney ingredients easy tomato chutney bruschetta recipe ingredients method tracklements chunky tomato chutney ingredients tomato onions raw cane sugar cider vinegar bramley apples carrots dates tomato puree sea salt garlic black pepper chillies all spice ginger. plus, it’s gluten free and very, very delicious! so, onto the recipe! easy tomato chutney bruschetta recipe ingredients tracklements chunky tomato chutney – or any other tomato chutney like my homemade tomato chutney or my christmas spiced apple and walnut chutney recipe 2 spring onions sliced finely 1 loaf of bread, ciabatta bread or sourdough bread – sliced and then halved 30g of fresh basil, chopped finely method add the finely chopped spring onions into a medium sized bowl chop up 30g of fresh basil finely and add to the bowl with the chopped spring onions add half the pot of tracklements chunky tomato chutney or approximately 145g. if you have the time, place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes so the ingredients can marinade together. while you are waiting, lightly toast the bread (i used sourdough bread) finally, add the marinade on top. you should be able to make around 12 pieces. you can essentially make 24 bruschetta slices using all the tracklements chunky tomato chutney never miss a new post!
