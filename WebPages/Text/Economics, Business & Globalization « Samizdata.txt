economics, business & globalization · slogans & quotations “president trump can’t do right by some critics no matter what he does. for three years he’s been denounced as a reckless authoritarian, and now he’s attacked for not being authoritarian enough by refusing to commandeer american industry. the truth is that private industry is responding to the coronavirus without command and control by the federal government.” the wall street journal’s editorial board. unfortunately, no-one is likely to find a cure for trump derangement syndrome this side of the heat death of the universe. i have taken the liberty of adding this excellent comment by ross clark, in the daily telegraph today. he seems to be one of the saner voices out there: the year 2020 has already brought many firsts: never before has the british population been confined to home, nor has a uk government previously offered to pay the wages of private sector staff. but here is another: it is the first time that donald trump has stood out as a rare voice of reason amid a cacophony of panic. at any other time, and coming from anyone else’s mouth, the statement “we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,” would hardly raise an eyebrow. it is surely a principle which ought to be baked into all government policy. but, no, it aroused instant condemnation from the president’s critics. as for his hope that he could get the economy roaring again by easter, it led to an eruption from senators who appear to be enjoying the global emergency, are who have no doubt sensed that coronavirus could be the black swan event that succeeds where impeachment failed. sure enough, trump has not bathed himself in glory over coronavirus, foolishly calling it a ‘hoax’ at one point. but he is right to recognise that there is a balance to be struck between fighting the disease and maintaining a functioning economy. so far, much of the developed world has embarked on a course which pursues the former to the total exclusion of the latter. last week, our own government published a dossier of the modelling which has informed its policy on coronavirus. there was plenty of epidemiological evidence in there, yet not a single paper modelling the economic effects of a lockdown. it is merely assumed that what will almost certainly be a steeper decline in economic output than either the 2008/09 crisis or the great depression can be put right by oodles of public money, much of it printed by central banks. i am sceptical: what is this crisis going to do to the entrepreneurial spirit of millions who invested time and their life savings to set up businesses only to find them forcibly closed by the government? it is going to take a long time to recover that. the most foolish remark you hear made in these situations is “lives are too important for money”. as trump quite rightly points out, unemployment will itself cost lives. so, too, will social isolation. there are 7.7 million britons who live alone, many of them elderly. there will be a serious cost to life now that enforced confinement will reduce them to the point of invisibility. in any other situation, the left would be jumping up every five minutes to claim that poverty costs lives. how often have we heard this fanciful figure that tory ‘austerity’ has cost 130,000 lives over the past decade? that is nothing compared with the toll we face from mass unemployment. philip thomas, professor of risk management at bristol university, calculates – in a study which has yet to be peer-reviewed – that if a lockdown causes the economy to shrink by more than 6.4 percent then the recession will have cost more lives than coronavirus itself. i would say a 6.4 percent shrinkage in gdp is on the seriously optimistic side. we don’t normally seem to have a problem balancing the needs of medicine with those of the economy. we could save lives by going into lockdown every winter – the us centers for disease control estimates that seasonal flu kills between 300,000 and 650,000 people annually. but we don’t because we know the economic havoc would be even worse. covid-19 is a serious disease, and one to which we began this year with no resistance. but its most damaging effect has been to destroy our ability to make a trade-off between medicine and the economy. march 25th, 2020 | 47 comments a little thing you can do to help

newly contrived magnets: note the bit at the bottom on the right, where you learn the size of these things. they are very small. why are miniature magnets like this so important? and why do they have to be 3d printed? that’s what ignorami like me want to know. the anonymous writer of the report accordingly begins it thus: magnetic materials are an important component of mechatronic devices such as wind power stations, electric motors, sensors and magnetic switch systems. magnets are usually produced using rare earths and conventional manufacturing methods. … a bit later he says: permanent magnets are incorporated into a number of mechatronic applications. traditional manufacturing methods such as sintering or injection moulding are not always able to cope with increasing miniaturisation and the resulting geometric requirements for magnets, and this is a trend which is sent to continue in the future. additive manufacturing processes offer the necessary freedom of design. … i had to look up sintering. blog and learn. → continue reading: thoughts provoked by some 3d printed miniature magnets march 13th, 2020 | 23 comments random thoughts about our predicament johnathan pearce (london) · economics, business & globalization · international affairs with the virus encouraging more people and businesses to develop online, remote working models, it is going to put a premium on things like high-speed, reliable internet, video, two-way video, etc. and paradoxically, that means digital viruses are even more a threat (and often come from the same places as the biological ones, such as china). so i expect that spending on cyber-security, as well as developing more resilient business models (diversified supply chains, closer-to-home manufacturing of essentials such as medicines), and leaner, more scalable medical services, will increase. that should happen as a free market response, rather than because the state wills it. this virus will be used to bash free trade, encourage protectionism, and so on. but the verities about the division of labour and comparative advantage remain. complete self-sufficiency cannot be squared with a high standard of living; autarky means a cramped, sclerotic world. there is a reason that the 1970s sitcom, the good life, was indeed a comedy because it took the piss out of the idea of freeing oneself of a complex division of labour. it brings enormous costs. protectionism, like its twin, anti-trust, are often the playthings of sore losers in business, and hit the consumer or smaller-scale entrepreneur. we should not lose sight of the enormous gains made since the end of the berlin wall and wider expansion of trade. the current disruption should encourage a more clear-eyed understanding of the risks of doing business with dictatorships and closed societies such as china, and a need to find alternatives where possible. wholesale theft of intellectual property can no longer be tolerated as easily as in the past. how to deal with that remains a difficult question. on the need to avoid undue risk, it is worth pondering the following: according to the us broadcaster tucker carlson, 95 per cent of generic drugs used in the us are imported from china, although i am not sure what he uses as a data source for this. most good investors understand the need for good portfolio diversification, so the same surely will apply to supply chains after this virus episode. the developments might also encourage, or they should, a more self-reliance culture (people should learn first aid, store more non-perishable foods at home and other necessities), and in countries where people have not become too sheeplike, encourage a more robust approach to self-defence and respect for property. imagine what happens if looting breaks out in certain situations. another takeway: this horrible episode has put certain rather silly (at least they are to me) concerns into perspective: pc pronouns for certain genders, “woke” remakes of action films like the much-delayed bond film, “cancel culture”, etc. it might even remind people that screaming that the world is coming to an end unless we switch off industrial civilisation right now is so silly, and so monstrous, that it blunts the public to legitimate worries out there. greta needs to put a sock in it, and go back to school and hit the books. and the man formerly known as prince harry simply must, for our sanity, fuck off. march 12th, 2020 | 51 comments samizdata quote of the day samizdata illuminatus (arkham, massachusetts) ·

comments how a standard rut gauge created a standard rail gauge brian micklethwait (london) · economics, business & globalization · historical views · international affairs · transport some mapporn: this is a map of the world’s different railway gauges. fun fact, if fact it be. in the schmoozing after a talk i attended earlier in the week, someone told me that britain’s four foot eight-and-a-half inch gauge is the result of how far apart horse-drawn carriages had their wheels, in the pre-railways north-east of england, that being where the railways in britain got started. the point being that such carriages also had a standard gauge. their wheels dug ruts in the un-tarred roads of those times, so if your carriage had a different “gauge”, it couldn’t travel in those ruts, and thus couldn’t travel at all. these ruts were rails before rails. and that regular distance apart transferred itself to the newly emerging railways. i haven’t checked this. i didn’t want to bother with any facts that might destroy my story, until i’d told my story. but as of now: feel free to destroy away. another question: will the railway gauges of the world ever change? by which i mean get somewhat less numerous. say: as a result of some sort of new intercontinental high speed rail system being developed. i seem to recall reading that in spain, the new high speed trains are the same gauge as those in france (and thus also britain) and different from the regular spanish gauge. or would a some futuristic global high speed system will just add yet another standard? (will brunel’s preferred seven foot gauge for the old great western line rise from the dead and conquer the world? guess: no.) cue the commentariat who will, i predict, change the subject to the qwerty keyboard, and then disagree about how that happened, and about how keyboards will be in two hundred years time. february 27th, 2020 | 18 comments i just did a bit of copying and pasting brian micklethwait (london) · economics, business & globalization · historical views · internet · north american affairs of this: born in new york city in 1945, tesler eventually studied computer science at stanford university before working in the school’s artificial intelligence research lab in the late 1960s. he moved to xerox in 1973, where he devised the time-saving concepts to cut, copy and paste in computer systems. “your workday is easier thanks to his revolutionary ideas,” xerox tweeted thursday to honor tesler. oh, it goes far beyond that, for me and surely for many others. my whole life was made possible by this sort of stuff. with thanks to instapundit. it’s little postings like this that keep me going back there. if all there was there was politics, i’d keep going back, but surely not so often. imagine having to copy out just the two links above, letter by letter, number by number. absurd. a bit later: i put together all of the above for my personal blog, but then i thought: this should go to samizdata. so i copied and pasted it across. took me about two minutes. february 21st, 2020 | 9 comments could you live in this socialist country?

patrick crozier (twickenham) · chinese affairs · economics, business & globalization · internet · military affairs · privacy & panopticon · science & technology there is a kerfuffle here in the uk over 5g. i can’t in all honesty say that i have the slightest idea what 5g is but i surmise that it is one better than 4g. the issue is around whether the chinese company, huawei, should be allowed to supply some of the equipment. lots of people, including james delingpole say, “no”. and very few people say, “yes”. the first question that springs to (my) mind is, what has this got to do with the government? which i suppose is bound up with the question of what is the threat? assuming that there is a threat and that government should be “doing something about it”, what is that something? about the only thing i know about china and telephony is that you should never take your phone to china. oh, and one other thing. guido fawkes observed that the real scandal is that chinese technology should prove to be better than western technology. is this true and is it a portent? january 29th, 2020 | 41 comments viruses and globalisation johnathan pearce (london) · asian affairs · economics, business & globalization the virus outbreak in china and the clampdown on travel and other activity by a communist country is inevitably going to cause some political commentary about the implications, and it already has. one comment i am bracing for is how this proves how dangerous globalisation can be because of extended supply chains, long-haul flights, etc. in fact i expect some on the green, anti-trade side might make such points. what the episode shows is that all advanced societies need “firebreaks” that can be imposed – hopefully by public consent for a limited period – (i mentioned firebreaks in my previous item about the australian bushfires). there may also be lessons to come out about local food and hygiene, as well as what is done to immunise young children and so forth. this echoes what i wrote the other day about how forest fires in australia got more deadly because the “immunity” of the forests was undermined by neglecting to do controlled burns and thin out dead trees. but it is wrong in a broader sense to say that viruses are a point against greater human interaction via trade in general. one might as well draw the conclusion that we should all live in sealed boxes. when the black death raged, it killed a huge number in relative terms of the population in affected areas, and other plagues in early history have been as deadly, and yet most people at the time did not travel far from home. some did of course, and human cities were dirty and unsanitary. but overall, the world of the 14th century wasn’t as globalised in terms of human interaction as it is now. let’s not forget that trade also increases options when a population is hit by a local disaster. take the case of food supply if the local produce goes wrong. lack of imported food access was fatal for ireland in the 1840s because corn laws hampered imports of wheat into the country. it is true that people who even friendly to the free market economy and global trade use words such as “contagion” to describe how an issue in country x can affect a nation y, and so on. (some have even claimed that chinese savings “surpluses” helped cause the 2008 financial crisis by funding the us housing binge. and writers such as james rickards have even attempted to defend protectionism and capital controls on the same basis that one might defend a fire safety door.) there are also implications for the effectiveness or otherwise of “transnational” organisations (aka “tranzis”), as this article at pajamas media states. china is still a deeply oppressive place in many ways, and the disaster today is grim, and worrying. but bear in mind dear reader how far that nation has come since mao, one of the greatest mass murderers in recorded history, has gone. the virus breaking out is horrible, but far less horrible than anything that bastard brought about. china is now much richer, and has the resources to tackle this plague. i wish them well. january 28th, 2020 | 25 comments you keep using that word “economy”. i do not think it means what you think it means. natalie solent (essex) · arts & entertainment · economics, business & globalization · environment · political economy · uk affairs “uk green economy has shrunk since 2014”, laments the guardian. the number of people employed in the “low carbon and renewable energy economy” declined by more than 11,000 to 235,900 between 2014 and 2018, according to the office for national statistics (ons). green businesses fared little better, seeing their numbers drop from an estimated 93,500 to 88,500 over the same four-year period.
