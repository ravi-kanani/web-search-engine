authority seo 2.0 blog about tools contact copy this email outreach strategy to get popular blogs to link to you by chris lee 83 comments last updated on: october 20, 2018 if you’ve been following my blog posts, you’ll know that outreach is my favorite way of building high quality backlinks to a site. why? it’s the most effective way to get powerful links from real websites with real traffic. over the years, i’ve acquired links from edu sites, popular blogs, and company websites all through using various forms of outreach. and recently, i’ve been using guest posting strategies to build links on the blogs of big corporations with huge domain authority. a single link from sources like these can really impact your rankings. and these are all links that i never would have gotten if it weren’t for the outreach campaigns that i ran. it’s still surprising to me, that even after countless blog posts, case studies, discussions, and news articles… so many people still revert to buying spammy link packages. if that sounds like you, i strongly recommend you read this post from ahrefs, and then read about the results of what happened when ordering one of those packages here. so what is outreach? i’ve written about the basics of how outreach works in the past. there are a lot of different outreach strategies you can follow, but the most basic one goes as follows: email one: connect reach out and say hello. praise their work, and ask a question. don’t ask for anything. email two: pitch when they respond to you, say thanks, pitch your article, and subtly ask for a link or share. it’s simple, and it works. and it doesn’t take a ton of time to do. you can easily get through 100 prospects in a day without outreach software if you use some gmail hacks like canned responses. now you might be thinking: this is such a common link building strategy for anybody who knows seo, so does it still work? what if the person you’re reaching out to is aware of what you’re doing, would it still work then? yes, and yes. and i want to show you the perfect example. recently, a reader of rankxl used the same strategy on me, and i didn’t even know it was happening until he sent the second email 🙂 i do outreach link building on a weekly basis for my niche sites, but this is the first time that someone’s used the strategy on me. and being on the other side of the email conversation, i was able to see just how effective the method is. impressed, i asked him if i could use our email conversation in a blog post and he agreed. so here it is: a perfect example of outreach at its most simplest form. how thiam got a link from rankxl using outreach a few weeks ago, i published a blog post titled, the 7 most common mistakes people make when starting a new niche site. i received quite a few emails after posting it, and one of them was this one from thiam. if it’s hard to read, here’s what it says: hi chris, just want to shout out and say hello. stumbled upon your blog post on 7 common mistakes in building a new niche site. great work! anyway, i have recently started my business in providing content marketing and writing services. i have a little trouble promoting the content that i have written. so just wondering how do you promote your content when you have no huge following, email list, or connections with influencers? hope to see your take on this. cheers, thiam hock he just recently started a new inbound marketing agency, and was looking for some tips on how to promote his content for a new blog. i get a lot of emails like this one so nothing really caught my attention at the time. but there are some things to note here that i really like: 1. it’s short and to the point. 2. he shows me right off the bat that he knows me, and that this isn’t some automated spam blast to a bunch of bloggers. 3. he praises my work, and asks me a question asking for advice. keeping your emails short encourages faster response times. if someone emails me a lengthy email that reads like an essay, i usually mark it to reply later on when i have more time to read through it. but shorter emails like this one i’ll usually try to just reply to it when i see it. lesson: keep your outreach emails short. you don’t need to tell them your life story. read your emails before hitting send, and erase parts that don’t really need to be there. get personal. getting personal just means you should show your prospect that you know them. i’ll often just ignore and not think much about emails that read generically. which one would you care to reply to? hello, we are a company called xyz trackers, and we have a new rankings tracking software we feel would be a perfect fit for your brand and audience. we would love it if you sign up for our affiliate program here: url. we offer 35% lifetime commissions! let us know if you have any questions. thanks, jim or… hey chris, love what you’re doing on rankxl. your post about monitoring rankings in particular really resonated with us here at xyz trackers. we recently released an update on our software that recommends new keywords and content ideas based on their current rankings. i’d really love for you to check it out when you get a chance. i think it’s something that might help you keep track and increase traffic to your niche sites. let me know anytime you have some free time on your hands, and i’ll set you up with a test account. keep up the great work! looking forward to your next blog post! thanks, jim don’t rush. it’s the easiest way to leave a bad impression and be ignored. the second outreach email is way better, and i’d feel bad not to reply them back. at the very least, i would check out what they were offering. lesson: it doesn’t take much longer to get to know a little bit about the prospect you’re reaching out to, but it makes a huge difference in your response rate. praise their work, and ask a question the first part of the first email needs to be all about them. thank them for their work, and if it has helped you in any way, mention it. nobody gets annoyed that too many people are emailing them to tell them they’re awesome 🙂 and at the end, always elicit a response by asking a question. but don’t be generic. thiam asked me: anyway, i have recently started my business in providing content marketing and writing services. i have a little trouble promoting the content that i have written. so just wondering how do you promote your content when you have no huge following, email list, or connections with influencers?” it was the perfect question. he didn’t say something like: “i have a new business. how do i get more traffic?” he asked a smart, detailed question that i could relate to. rankxl is only a year old now, so it’s something that i just recently went through when i first launched the blog and had no traffic myself. i had a lot of fresh advice to give on this point, and was more than happy to help. lesson: ask a question that the prospect would want to answer. timing and recency rather than email me about a post i wrote a year ago, thiam emailed me about my newest blog post that i had just recently released. although this isn’t something that will make or break your outreach success rate, it still helps quite a bit to focus on a recent blog post rather than an old one buried in the archives. why? right after publishing a new blog post is when the memory is clearest in my mind. it’s also when the blog post has the most activity. the few days after posting it is when i’m busiest responding to comments and emails about it. it’s also the time period where i’ll be most likely to make any edits to improve it based on the feedback i receive. so, i replied to him with: if it’s hard to read, here’s what it says: hey thiam, thanks for reaching out. the way i connected was by just reaching out to bloggers, just like you did here 🙂 also, i wrote guest posts on some big blogs which helped, and also posting in forums. it’s slow at the beginning. i think since you’re offering writing services, it’s best to write a lot of guest posts to build up a portfolio. people pay attention when you mention you’ve been featured on some big sites. -chris it’s the email he sent next that really impressed me: if it’s hard to read, here’s what it says: hi chris, thanks for the reply and the advice on guest posting. i will be sourcing out for blogs for guest posting opportunities from today onwards. anyway, in the article, you have mentioned that quality is more important than quantity in publishing. having a 1-2 piece of great content is better than a site with many crappy content. i can totally resonate with you on this. in fact, i have just published my first (and only) post on creating high-quality content. it is a step-by-step guide featuring 17 techniques that bloggers can use to increase the quality of their content. i believe it will benefits your readers greatly. the link to the article is: http://team3pal.com/high-quality-content/ this article is more than 7000 words long. i would love it if you could give me your feedback on it? it will be great if you decided to share it with your readers. i would appreciate your help. cheers, thiam hock there’s a lot of things he did well in this email. let’s dissect. first, before anything else, he acknowledges the advice i gave him, and mentions how he will be putting it into practice. next, he makes the transition into pitching his own article. but instead of just jumping in and telling me about his awesome new article, he mentions a point that i made in my own article first. and then he transitions into mentioning his own article. even adding in that it will be helpful for my readers (hint, hint – share it!) and at the end, he goes in for the ask. he did a few things well here. first, he mentions that the article is 7000 words long. that immediately catches my attention. that’s massive. next, he asks for my feedback instead of just asking me to link to it. this makes me want to read it thoroughly and give it a careful look so that i could say something insightful about it. finally, he asks if i could share it with my readers. this is something i wrote about before. you’ll usually get better results if you ask for a share. don’t do this: “could you please link to it from your blog? please consider adding it to your latest article. it will make a great fit!” i’ve gotten quite a few emails that read like that, and it’s a major turn off. no need to sound needy or desperate. just subtly ask them to share it with their readers. they’ll decide if a link or share is best. in this case, it was a perfect addition to my article so i added in a link. and even if i didn’t, the next time i write about content quality, i would think of his site. i added in a link and told him about it: here’s what it says: hey thiam, really impressed with your outreach skill 🙂 this is a lot of what i teach in the niche site course. i checked out your massive guide, and it’s awesome. i’ve added in a link to it in the article: https://www.rankxl.com/common-mistakes-building-new-niche-site/ under point #2. keep up the great work! -chris you can see the link here: https://www.rankxl.com/common-mistakes-building-new-niche-site/ under point #2. then, he finished off the conversation perfectly with his closing email: here’s what it says: hi chris, thank you so much for including the link. really appreciate it. great that you think the guide is awesome. i do not mind you use our conversation as an example. thanks, thiam hock p.s. i am reading rankxl.com from the first post onwards at the moment. i think it is a shame for me that i only found your blog yesterday. it is a great blog! not every outreach email you send will have results like this. but reaching out to the right prospects, and following these basic outreach principles ensures a high rate of success. of course, you need to have a link-worthy piece of content to begin with. thiam’s article was link-worthy. it was lengthy, extremely in-depth and gave a lot of great advice on how to create high quality content. if you want to take a look at it, here’s the link: http://team3pal.com/high-quality-content/. the lesson here? spend the time and effort on creating something that’s actually worth linking to. if you’re doing outreach and trying to ask for links to a page that even you wouldn’t link to yourself, that’s when you’ll run into roadblocks. conclusion outreach link building is and will continue to be an effective way to build links and get your content shared. it isn’t easy to scale. but a single link can make a big impact, so it’s not something that requires hundreds or thousands of links before you see results. even just building a couple of links per week can make a big difference in your search rankings and traffic. would it have been easier for thiam to just leave a comment and place his url inside the comment box? for sure. but it wouldn’t be the same link. comment links are weak, and they’re nofollow. they don’t impact rankings. but by using an effective outreach strategy, he was able to get a do-follow, editorial link from a relevant blog. not only that, but it’s going to drive him a good amount of traffic from an audience interested in what his business offers. if you start a new blog, make sure to try out this strategy to get some strong initial traction. facebook twitter pinterest you might also like... where to find free stock photos for your blog & niche sites how (and when) to correctly combine multiple blog posts together how i get permanent links from wikipedia for every website i build 83 comments reply rob march 23, 2016 at 8:45 am nice post chris! i feel like it is kind of awkward when you do outreach and the recipient knows what you are up to, but i agree, outreach is still the best way of promoting your content and buildings links at the same time! and it is completely whitehat. reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 3:54 pm haha, agree it can feel awkward but as long as you’re not pushy the email convo can be beneficial for your networking even if you don’t end up getting a link from it. reply vin march 23, 2016 at 1:07 pm hey chris. looks like you’re really coming along with your outreach methods. i’m still in the mindset of buying links, or otherwise obtaining them in a not-so-white-hat way…. but i know i’ll have to bite the bullet and start polishing my outreach chops one of these days. thankfully, my content creation company lends itself nicely to creating some nice link bait for outreach campaigns. can i ask you how many e-mails you send out per day / week, and what your return is on that effort? reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 3:55 pm hey vin! i don’t do outreach on a daily basis. the task is pretty time-consuming and boring to do which is why i’ll do it every week or two. sending 100-200 emails and expecting to see about a 5-10% success rate. reply vin march 24, 2016 at 10:20 am yeah – about the same experience here. do you ever get worried that your e-mails are being ghosted or thrown directly into spam folders? i think there’s a way to get your e-mails “approved” with some kind of regulator that will reduce the amount of e-mails delivered to a junk file…but i remember the process being pretty annoying. any thoughts? reply chris lee march 24, 2016 at 1:54 pm i try to just keep the email language casual, try to use their name whenever possible, and avoid words that might cause it to get filtered as spam. reply bryan march 23, 2016 at 1:28 pm it’s almost like viewing a live tutorial on how to do proper outreach. as a matter of fact, i was reading module 1 again about “asking for a share” part and your newsletter popped up, talking about the same thing i just read 🙂 reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 3:56 pm awesome 🙂 thanks for reading, bryan! reply dominique jackson march 23, 2016 at 1:57 pm cool post chris. it’s similar to a post i recently did on the same topic. like you, outreach is my favorite “link building” tactic. the problem i see with the way most people do outreach is they’re extremely lazy. i receive a bunch of automated outreach emails every month, and sometimes it shocks me how little effort they put in. they won’t include my name or any personalization at all. like you said, the key is really personalizing each email as much as possible. you can have a base template to work from, but each email you send should be customized to the person you’re contacting. feel free to check out my post here: http://dominiquej.com/bad-email-outreach-examples/ p.s. i bought your course when you relaunched it and really dig it! reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 4:00 pm thanks dominique. great article, thanks for sharing that! really like how you show real examples of bad outreach emails. reply terry jenkins march 23, 2016 at 4:35 pm hi chris. as a student of your rankxl niche site course it was great to see a working example of one of the many techniques your teach on the course. keep up the good work, we all appreciate it!! reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 6:59 pm thank you terry 🙂 reply sergey march 23, 2016 at 4:40 pm hey chris, nice post, interesting how you dissect the anatomy of a good outreach email. my question would be how do you find the correct contact info of a decision maker. there are a lot of blogs online but once it becomes more than one man operation, it becomes really difficult to do an outreach. especially when blog is impersonal, like many popular blogs are. what do you do in this case? thanks! reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 7:00 pm hey sergey, at that point you can hire a va to do it for you, or use software like content marketer, buzzstream, or ninja outreach which should speed up the process. reply sergey march 24, 2016 at 5:58 pm 🙂 doing all of that. have 2 full-time employees who do that. tried automatic tools but from 500 emails haven’t had a single response, so i decided to do it the hard way, i.e. manually. i am seeing some success, but i was wondering how you find contact info after pre-qualifying everything else. reply louren march 23, 2016 at 4:44 pm hi, chris! as always nice content you got here! i’ll bookmark this as an added reference for my outreach. thanks man! reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 7:01 pm great to hear! thanks louren! reply jian march 23, 2016 at 7:30 pm why is thiam hock even starting an content marketing service if he doesn’t even know how to market his own content in the first place? funny… reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 8:55 pm hey jian, the question you ask your prospect in your outreach email is based on 3 things: 1. the one you feel is most relevant to him/her. 2. the one you feel would get a high response rate. 3. one that’s related to your content. in thiam’s case, that question was how to promote a blog/service when it’s just been established. i’m pretty sure thiam knew what he was doing when he first reached out to me 🙂 reply patrick march 23, 2016 at 7:51 pm hello chris, very nice article, i check that i did few mistakes when outreach. because i havent effect when i send 300 e-mails 🙁 reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 8:55 pm thanks patrick. i hope the article was helpful. reply nathan march 23, 2016 at 7:56 pm hi chris – i’ve had a question about ongoing outreach that i’ve wanted to ask you… you write an article and send 200 outreach emails. a month later you write another article for the site and send another 200 outreach emails. my question is about the ongoing outreach. specifically, do you go back to sites that haven’t linked to you and ask them for a link for the next article you’ve written? it would seem that you couldn’t keep find a fresh 100-300 link prospects. that would quickly get into the thousands, and there might not be that many quality sites on a subject. thoughts? reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 8:59 pm hey nathan. i rarely contact the same prospects twice. i don’t use any sort of sophisticated tracking system, so there will be times when i unknowingly email someone a second time, which isn’t the end of the world. or if i’ve developed a relationship with a past prospect, i might decide to just hit them up and let them know about a new post regardless if they’ve linked to me in the past or not. but each post is based around a different topic, which means you would be able to use different keywords to find new sites to reach out to. reply alexey march 23, 2016 at 8:39 pm thank you for the post chris, that was very useful. will you continue publishing updates how your nice site is going in terms of profit and grow strategy? that was really interesting to read. reply chris lee march 23, 2016 at 9:00 pm glad to hear that alexey 🙂 yeah, i will be writing some form of updates posts from time to time, but nothing on a scheduled basis like before. reply darmawan march 23, 2016 at 10:31 pm great article, chris. i agree with what you said about smart, detailed question. i own a marketing blog myself and it’s exactly like what you said… there’s always someone asking generic questions that can’t be answered. i’m getting at least 5 emails per day from my readers, asking how they can grow their traffic. i mean, it’s already answered in one of my articles and it’s impossible to answer them without any context over email. anyway, great job with the article. i’d love to see more examples from your other blogs! (by the way, it’s funny, just 2 days ago i published a similar article on the english version of my blog) reply chris lee march 24, 2016 at 1:51 pm thanks darmawan! if you want to share the url for your post here, i’d love to read it! reply john paul march 24, 2016 at 12:54 am its getting whiteir .. ill be doing this white link building.. thanks a lot chris… reply chris lee march 24, 2016 at 1:53 pm glad it was helpful! thanks for reading, john paul 🙂 reply pankaj solanki march 24, 2016 at 10:22 am hey chris, it is a great post, i learned so many things. btw, just curious, what was the subject line that thiam used 😉 reply chris lee march 24, 2016 at 1:55 pm great question, pankaj! it was: great article on common mistakes in building niche site reply david babinec march 24, 2016 at 11:26 am nice post, chris! i smell backlinko reader there 🙂 but greatly executed by thiam. reply chris lee march 24, 2016 at 1:58 pm hehe, could be! reply philos march 24, 2016 at 11:50 am reminds me of a similar email i got a few weeks ago. i mean from the moment you open the email you know they are eventually going to ask for a link. so, you let it play along and see how things go. if they try to force your hand real quick you just forget them. if they are civil in their ask a yes or a strong ‘i’ll consider it’ is likely. but this all reminds us of the power of ask. i mean there are many people who want things (like great links and shares) and they know where to get the help but they just sit working their own things waiting to be discovered (which isn’t entirely a bad thing). and this is not just for beginners but also the pros. everyone has room to tweak and improve things – as you mention in many of your blog posts chris. the power of an ask (and the habit to keep doing it) when you couple it with quality and amazing content is really something to behold. and yes i learn a lot from these emails (the ones i sometimes receive) and the ones i come across in blog posts like this one. do you also foresee an ask (for a link or share) from a mile a way – and just let the thing play out (seeing how different people approach outreach)? reply chris lee march 24, 2016 at 2:02 pm yeah, since outreach is pretty common (especially in the im niche), you can tell when someone is experienced and knows what they’re doing. i always let it play out. even if their main purpose might be to get a link or share from me, there’s always the opportunity to network and develop a relationship with the person. and if the content is good, there’s really no reason to not consider sharing it. reply bhuboy villanueva march 26, 2016 at 12:39 am great post , another proof that what your teaching works, now what’s left for me is the massive action part, thanks for this reply chris lee march 26, 2016 at 10:00 pm thanks for reading bhuboy 🙂 reply eve march 28, 2016 at 7:32 pm nice post, chris. 🙂 your lessons have been very helpful. i’d also love to read more about posting in forums, and how you implement that strategy. btw, thanks for teach such a useful information. reply chris lee march 29, 2016 at 12:39 am thanks eve! actually forum posting is pretty much the only thing i did to promote the rankxl blog when i first started it. all i did was come up with a catchy cta and then linked it from within my profile signature. reply hussain april 9, 2016 at 1:30 am hey chris, great inputs! this is an epic post on the outreaching techniques, loved it! thanks for sharing it with the real examples. regards hussain reply chris lee april 11, 2016 at 11:14 pm thanks for reading, hussain! reply alex april 11, 2016 at 1:37 pm hi, chris what you think about ifttt backlinks? by 2 words: it’s republishing content from your main site to fb, twitter, tumblr, etc. which also republish to the same social profiles. it’s not hidden marketing comment 😉 thanks reply chris lee april 11, 2016 at 11:16 pm hey alex! you mean systemizing publishing on social? i wouldn’t call them backlinks, but they can help drive more traffic to your posts, and save you a lot of time so you don’t have to go in and post them manually. reply larry april 19, 2016 at 1:13 am thanks for sharing this. i’ve been using the technique you shared above since the last time i commented above, and am happy to have gotten 3 great links from sites i normally wouldn’t have been able to. i did notice though that this takes a bit of time and work since you don’t just go and ask but more like build relationship and follow the blog. but it’s super effective. chris, i wanted to ask you something about broken link building. i’m testing other strategies you’ve shared here and have noticed that searching for broken links is quite time consuming. i mean, i’ve gone through like a few hundred sites (using the google footprints w/ various keywords), and have gotten something like 30-40 potential targets only. is this how it really goes or am i missing something? reply chris lee april 22, 2016 at 1:44 am hey larry, that’s awesome! nice work! input the broken link url into a backlink checker to see all the sites linking to it. you’ll get more prospects that way. reply david cross april 20, 2016 at 9:53 am hey chris, great tips! i had no success with this method, but after reading the email conversation you had with thiam, i realize that my strategy was wrong. it is definitely about how you approach the subject. asking for a link is kind of yes/no, but asking to share your post with their readers is making them think about the options: should i include a link in my next post, should i share on social media, etc. i invite you to submit a post to our website if you are interested. our readers would love to read such great stories and information. thanks again for the great post. reply chris lee april 22, 2016 at 1:47 am thanks for your feedback david! thanks for the invite! i’m a little busy to do guest posts at the moment (behind on blog posts for this blog as well haha) but i’d love to in the future if the invitation is still open 🙂 reply pranjal borah april 30, 2016 at 8:35 am hi chris, nice and elaborative post indeed. the way you explain throught the post really impressed me. thanks. reply chris lee may 2, 2016 at 3:55 am thanks pranjal 🙂 reply stephen may 18, 2016 at 7:56 pm hey chris, question about the tools you use for outreach– on your toolbox page you mention buzzstream, ninjaoutreach and contentmarketer.io. could you elaborate on how you use them, and if you have any new tools you’re considering adding to your workflow? reply chris lee may 20, 2016 at 1:34 am i don’t use buzzstream and ninjaoutreach as much. i should be, it would make my life a lot easier. but i’m used to doing most things manually. they are still the best tools for outreach so i listed them there. reply tarso june 4, 2016 at 1:04 am good article, chris! you mentioned piece by piece. helped me a lot! i have one new blog, but with just a few posts. i’m working on build links. i got 2 questions: 1. do you think, before i contact bloggers, i should write a few more articles to my blog doesn’t look “empty”, or i just go ahead like that? 2. since i’m new, unknown, is better to contact intermediate bloggers first or just go right to the top bloggers of my niche? thanks for this content! reply chris lee june 4, 2016 at 5:33 pm thanks tarso! nope, that’s a common misconception. you can contact people with just 1 post published on your site. intermediate bloggers will usually be easier to get in touch with. reply adebayo oluwole june 6, 2016 at 12:30 pm i quite enjoy your post and it was educative. please can do-follow comments from low alexa ranked websites affect hampers a website? i have a lot of them but not sure if i should give them approval. reply chris lee june 9, 2016 at 7:05 pm if you mean approving comments with links in them, that’s fine. just make sure it’s relevant to the post and can be helpful for readers to click through. reply pengobatan herbal june 10, 2016 at 5:01 am nice info, thanks reply chris lee june 11, 2016 at 9:39 am thanks for reading pengobatan! reply legitimentary june 13, 2016 at 7:02 pm thanks for this awesome article! i just got linked here from a niche site group on fb, and i can’t wait to read more. reply chris lee june 16, 2016 at 5:34 pm cool! thanks for stopping by. reply receitas simples e gostosas august 3, 2016 at 11:01 am i’ll start testing this reply chris lee august 7, 2016 at 2:26 pm cool, let me know how it works out for you! reply rani maharani august 7, 2016 at 6:07 am eventhough spending more time, that tactics works effectively. i just try for few month and the result is better. thanks for your detail steps… reply chris lee august 7, 2016 at 2:27 pm that’s great to hear, rani. glad it worked well for you. reply mayaprakash pant august 11, 2016 at 4:16 am wow. great piece of content about how to get attention from an influencer. thanks for this outstanding article. 😉 reply chris lee august 11, 2016 at 3:29 pm glad it was helpful. thanks for reading mayaprakash! reply babs september 9, 2016 at 8:59 am great strategy chris. can’t wait to try it out soon. cheers, -babs. reply chris lee september 11, 2016 at 4:10 pm cool, thanks babs 🙂 reply imer imran september 17, 2016 at 10:52 pm hi chris i have to admit, this is a very informative article. i agree with your say above “comment links are weak, and they’re no-follow. they don’t impact rankings”, but i think the other purpose to do blog comment is also to build friendship, expand brand awareness and also drive traffic if it’s done with the right way. any thoughts? imer reply chris lee september 21, 2016 at 1:53 pm great points! yeah, in fact a lot of the guest posting opportunities i got were started by just commenting frequently. reply dan january 17, 2017 at 7:09 am hi chris, sorry for stalking you today… just cannot leave your site… have a question: do you have an opion on tools like this? https://www.guestposttracker.com/ it’s not so much that i couldn’t keep an exccel sheet, but they seem to suggest guest post accepting blogs… question is if that is any value (when it is too easy)? thx a million dan reply chris lee january 31, 2017 at 3:22 pm i haven’t heard about that site, but you’ll have to check the authority of each site, and make sure that it’s not turning into a content farm with irrelevant topics. reply emmerey rose january 23, 2017 at 10:32 pm thanks for sharing chris! helps a lot! i wonder, which social media platforms works for you when you connect or engage with bloggers? twitter doesn’t seem great base on my experience though. reply chris lee january 24, 2017 at 8:08 pm twitter is usually the best. reply emmerey rose january 24, 2017 at 10:08 pm interesting. but thanks chris for your feedback. might want to give twitter another try then 🙂 reply walter february 24, 2017 at 1:32 am hi chris, hey chris,since i enrolled on your course,i am getting the greatest knowledge that i have never found anywhere online. your content is well organized,easy to understand and implement. i have been sitting around and waiting for my posts to get backlinks not knowing there is away to go about it. thanks again chris. reply chris lee february 24, 2017 at 6:04 pm really excited to hear that! thanks walter 🙂 reply ndifreke atauyo march 14, 2017 at 1:02 am i am glad i found your blog posts and am enjoying your lessons to its fullest. as per your advice i will certainly reach out to bloggers for content marketing. this is awesome. thanks for sharing your wisdom. reply chris lee march 16, 2017 at 11:57 am thanks! reply saurav mishra february 18, 2018 at 11:04 am hey chris, i keep coming to your blog from mail newsletter! if not already, you should do a post on how to get better ctr on mail campaigns 😉 for me what has also worked a lot of times is giving back. while a genuine praise helps, there is always a way you can give something of value – a good reading reference, a useful connection introduction , testimonial for offerings, onpage audit report, so on. it’s up to an individual to be as creative as possible. but the jab, jab, jab , hook formula by gary vee almost always works like magic. reply chris lee february 19, 2018 at 5:57 pm haha, cool 🙂 and excellent point! thanks for sharing. reply aaron february 3, 2019 at 1:58 am great post, your blog has become an authority website and really stands out. reply chris lee february 3, 2019 at 11:53 am thanks aaron 🙂 reply ayesha anwar july 19, 2019 at 7:52 am great work chris! i read your detailed post and would really love to share it with my coworkers. although it’s been years that i have been in blogger outreach but still this case study helped me a lot in improving my skills. leave a reply cancel reply zero to 100k with seo a free 5-part seo email course that will show you step-by-step how to grow traffic from zero to 100,000 visitors per month (with search). sign up for free zero to 100k with seo a free 5-part seo email course that will show you step-by-step how to grow traffic from zero to 100,000 visitors per month (with search). sign me up © 2019 rankxl. all rights reserved. | contact | twitter zero to 100k with seo free 5-part mini-course. enter your email to get lesson #1. email* send me the first lesson enter your email below to get the zero to 100k mini-course email* send me the first lesson
