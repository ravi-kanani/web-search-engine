(@walterstephanie) march 27, 2020 since even dealing with the unfamiliar landscapes of github and netlify might be a big ask for many non-technical organizations, it might be worth considering the help of volunteer developers. the initial setup is a 10-minute job for devs who understand the stack. organizations could get in touch with a volunteer to help them get the site online, then take over and update the content. # get in touch! in the meantime, if you want to set up an emergency website and need help to get started, let me know! emergency website kit max böck published in [code] ⋅ 22 mar 2020 follow @mxbck webmentions 144 73 (show all) +68 what’s this? manuel matuzović ⋅ 22 mar 2020 - 19:18 now, that's awesome!
