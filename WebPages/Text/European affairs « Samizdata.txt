probably not, i would guess. in which case why do the latest figures from the robert koch institute show that the country has a case fatality rate (cfr) of 0.3 per cent, while the world health organisation (who) figures from italy seem to show a cfr of 9 per cent? to say there is a vast gulf between those figures is an understatement. if nine per cent of people who catch covid-19 are going to die from it we are facing a calamity beyond parallel in the modern world. if only 0.3 per cent of people who catch it die from it, this pandemic may yet turn out to be no worse than seasonal flu, which as i have explained here before is estimated by the us centers for disease control to kill between 291,000 and 646,000 people a year without the world really noticing. according to john hopkins university, which is collating fatalities data, 15,308 have died to date. ross clark, spectator (behind paywall). a couple more: germany is almost certainly behind italy in this epidemic. but the main difference between germany and italy lies in those countries’ respective attitudes towards testing. germany has carried out far more enthusiastic testing of the general population – there does not seem to be a central figure for this, but the german doctors’ association has estimated that 200,000 people across the country have been tested. in britain, it is 64,000 people. on the other hand, german hospitals do not routinely test for the presence of coronavirus in patients who are dying or who have died of other diseases. italy, by contrast, is performing posthumous coronavirus tests on patients whose deaths might otherwise have been attributed to other causes. it stands to reason that the more people who are tested, the more accurate a picture we will have of the mortality rate, the transmission rate and other metrics which will determine the eventual path of this pandemic. to underline the uncertainties behind the data from which policy is currently being made, the royal society of hygiene and tropical medicine the other day estimated the number of people in britain who already have or have had covid-19 at between 6,000 and 23 million. that is a pretty broad spread with hugely different implications. if only 6,000 have the disease in britain, socially-distancing the population or locking down society might have a purpose. if 23 million have the disease, it is pointless – it already has ripped its way through the population but without killing more than a tiny percentage. what we really need is a huge effort to test a large randomised sample of the population to see how widespread the infection is. hopefully, that will soon happen. but in the meantime, i am minded to think that the more accurate picture of covid-19 comes from the country which has conducted the most tests: germany. the more i read, the more it seems to me that randomised testing, as clark writes, is crucial, not least in reducing hysteria and the effects that hysteria is having, and will continue to have, on our society and business. the costs, in terms of stress, the destruction of businesses and so much effort, needs to be weighed. i have come across a few comments on social media, of the passive/aggressive sort, that “it is so amusing to see all these experts all over social media on epidemics” – the implication being that the mass public should shut up, “stay in your lane” and let the men/women in white coats take charge. the problem with this however is what happens if the experts disagree, or if their policy advice causes so much damage, including to the liberties and welfare of the citizenry, that a democratically elected politician has to make a judgement call? we don’t, rightly, outsource vast coercive powers to everyone who claims to be an expert on something. that’s not how it is supposed to work. march 23rd, 2020 | 28 comments in france you now have to download a permit to go for a walk natalie solent (essex) · civil liberty & regulation · european affairs · french affairs · health & medical · privacy & panopticon at first i thought this was une blague pratique. apparently not, unless tim worstall’s denial is merely evidence that he is in on the joke. he writes in today’s times: among the measures introduced in france to deal with the coronavirus is a requirement to fill in a form before going out for a walk. no, really, this is not a joke. as part of the lockdown it is necessary, before leaving the house, to complete and sign a download from the ministry of the interior. name, address, what you think you’re doing and so on. this is not filed with anyone, nor registered. it must simply be carried during the errand. absence, if caught, will lead to a €135 fine. a new form is required for every exit from the house. and yes, there’s a box to tick for “aux besoins des animaux de compagnie” which my memories of exchange visits have as “for the needs of our furry friends”. the solution to a global pandemic is a form for walking the dog. of course, it is easy to mock the french but there is an important point here, for this is an example of a pernicious worldview. that we, the people, are only able to cope if we are told what to do, what we may do. all must be decided and enforced by the clever people in power and nothing left to ordinary folks to get on with. our own tradition is vehemently different. i have surprised people in a number of countries by pointing out that a british policeman isn’t actually allowed to ask — or at least not to insist upon knowing — what it is that you are doing. if accosted, a cheery “going about my lawful business, constable” is all that is required. such liberties might not apply in moments of crisis but they are indicative of a different manner of thinking. a similar restriction is being applied in italy, according to the local.it: now that justification is required simply to be on the street, you’ll need to have a copy ready as soon as you leave the house. if you have access to a printer, you can download the form here. ther’s also now an application able to generate an electronic version of the ‘autocertificazione’ form as many times as needed, to keep handy on your phone with a digital signature. police at checkpoints (such as those at train stations) should also have a stack of paper forms available, and you can ask to take a few. but what if you do not have access to the internet? alternatively you can copy out the whole thing by hand: make sure to write everything exactly as it appears on the form, in full. march 19th, 2020 | 74 comments “extinction rebellion isn’t about the climate” says one of its founders natalie solent (essex) · environment · european affairs · languages · media & journalism · science & technology · uk affairs “i’ve been with extinction rebellion (xr) from the start”, stuart basden explains. and for the sake of transparency: that previous paragraph is all about me ‘pulling rank’ — i’m trying to convince you to listen to what i have to say… and i’m here to say that xr isn’t about the climate. you see, the climate’s breakdown is a symptom of a toxic system of that has infected the ways we relate to each other as humans and to all life. this was exacerbated when european ‘civilisation’ was spread around the globe through cruelty and violence (especially) over the last 600 years of colonialism, although the roots of the infections go much further back. as europeans spread their toxicity around the world, they brought torture, genocide, carnage and suffering to the ends of the earth. their cultural myths justified the horrors, such as the idea that indigenous people were animals (not humans), and therefore god had given us dominion over them. this was used to justify a multi-continent-wide genocide of tens of millions of people. the coming of the scientific era saw this intensify, as the world around us was increasingly seen as ‘dead’ matter — just sitting there waiting for us to exploit it and use it up. we’re now using it up faster than ever. euro-americans violently imposed and taught dangerous delusions that they used to justify the exploitation and reinforced our dominance, while silencing worldviews that differed or challenged them. the uk’s hand in this was enormous, as can be seen by the size of the former british empire, and the dominance of the english language around the world. this article is a year old, but someone on the uk politics subreddit called “wherehascentrismgone” posted it with the comment that it made the now rescinded decision by the police to include extinction rebellion in a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to the authorities running the prevent anti-terrorism programme seem more reasonable. i think it was out of order for the police to put xr on a terrorism watch list – their stunts annoy but are not violent – but we should be grateful to mr basden for reminding us that xr should be avoided by anyone who seriously wants to protect either the environment or their own mental health, seeing as the organisation is an anti-scientific cult fuelled by the neurotic self-hatred of privileged dilletantes in rich countries. january 11th, 2020 | 24 comments - (comments are closed) let us remember their sacrifice a century ago natalie solent (essex) · deleted by the pc media · european affairs · historical views because if we don’t, who will?

and why did it first erupt where it did, in europe? for some time now i have been getting to grips with a new book by stephen davies entitled the wealth explosion: the nature and origins of modernity. the central and most striking arguments in this book concern how europe was – and just as significantly, was not – exceptional, as a potential detonator of this wealth explosion. clearly there was something exceptional about europe, or the wealth explosion that we all now enjoy would not have started here. and equally clearly, all the positive ingredients needed for the explosion had to be present here for it to start happening. but the mere presence of all these positive ingredients, says davies, is not what made europe exceptional. until europe started exploding economically at the end of the eighteenth century, it had been, globally speaking, an economic and cultural backwater. all of these ingredients – demographic, economic, social, institutional, intellectual, spiritual – had been present, in greater strength and for far longer, in other parts of the world, most notably in china. the economic and cultural centre of the world, at least until the late eighteenth century, was not europe but rather the lands around the indian ocean. so, why did the wealth explosion not happen there? the answer that davies supplies in the wealth explosion is that europe was exceptional in being the only one of the world’s great civilisations that was not, at the historical moment when it mattered, politically unified. no european “hegemon” emerged in the centuries just before the wealth explosion got started, in the way that single imperial regimes had emerged to dominate russia, the middle east and india, and as had long been in successive imperial command in china. this was the decisive negative ingredient that europe possessed but which was lacking elsewhere, and this was what made the difference. the wealth explosion got seriously explosive in europe because, when it started and from then on, nobody in europe was powerful enough or motivated enough to stop it. on the contrary, the rulers of europe never stopped competing with one another, and were therefore strongly incentivised to keep their wealth explosion going, despite all the upheaval that it caused. economic stasis, and cultural stagnation of the sort that would have stopped the wealth explosion, was not, for the various contending rulers of europe, an option. they needed guns, guns which had to keep on getting better. they needed money, to pay for the guns, and for the ever increasing numbers of people needed to develop, fire and later to carry the guns into battle. they needed the wealth explosion, no matter how much it was empowering new classes of citizen producers and citizen warriors. so, they let it happen. they even encouraged it. at which point the only way not to be beaten by the wealth explosion was to join it. and there we have it: the modern world. the above is my best shot at summarising what i think is the most important line of argument in the wealth explosion. i had intended to write a single, quite long, mostly glowing review of this book. and i tried, i really tried. but the task defeated me (especially the “quite” long bit). despite its small size for such a subject (only 248 pages) the wealth explosion contains so many interesting ideas besides those summarised above, so much pertinent historical detail, and so many judgements based on the voluminous writings and discoveries of other historians, that i found it impossible to say everything that i wanted to say about it in one blog posting, while remaining confident that anyone at all would want to wade through all that i had written. so, i abandoned the attempt to say everything, and instead decided to make a start by merely saying something. i now intend that there will be several more postings here about the wealth explosion (in the manner of these recent postings here by patrick crozier about ulster). that’s the plan anyway. i’ll end this first posting about the wealth explosion by saying that, although i don’t now want to elaborate on why i find the central argument of this book, as outlined above, to be so persuasive, i do find it to be very persuasive, and the book in general to be fascinating. and since the historical event in question is arguably the biggest single fact that there is about the world that we now live in, that makes this a very good book indeed. how do you write an excellent work of grand historical theory? you ask important questions and you supply convincing answers. you support these answers with many other interesting and closely related truths, and with reports of relevant debates among and with your fellow historians. this is what i think stephen davies has done. meanwhile, to learn more about the wealth explosion, read the review of it that ananya chowdhury did manage to write, for the adam smith institute blog. or, read what stephen davies himself wrote about his book and its conclusions, for capx. or, if you like it when people are good at talking to camera as well as good at writing (stephen davies is very good at both), listen to what davies said to the cato institute about his book, as recorded in this video. september 2nd, 2019 | 77 comments - (comments are closed) have we vanished into the night? mr ed · european affairs · european union · how very odd! · uk affairs the good folk at lawyers for britain have published a short paper by an eminent qc, recently retired, on whether or not the latest ‘extension’ of the ‘article 50’ 2 year period for making arrangements to leave the eu is valid, if it is not, the upshot of this would be that the uk left the eu at 23.00 hours on 29th march 2019 (without anyone realising it). the author of the piece, stanley brodie qc, puts his argument around the way in which article 50 is worded, and suggests that there was only power within article 50 for one extension to the negotiation period, which the hapless mrs may used up in her botched attempts at getting an extension to ram through parliament her ‘withdrawal agreement’. our learned friend’s view of the proviso for an extension of article 50 includes: the proviso could not be used to reopen, or continue, never ending debate. nor can it be used as a general power to extend time. one might hope, but this is the eu. he also says that when the eu made a counter-proposal for extension of the negotiation period with the uk, this was not lawfully done. on 25th march 2019, the uk government set out its plans for delaying departure, in brief, there was this announcement: “3. however, the agreement reached with the eu provides for two possible durations: a. an extension to 11pm on 22 may 2019 if the house of commons approves the withdrawal agreement by 29 march; or b. an extension to 11pm on 12 april 2019 if it does not, before which the uk would need to put forward an alternative plan on decide to leave without a deal. 4. the government has therefore laid today, monday 25 march, a draft si under section 20(4) that provides for both these possibilities; …” mr brodie’s view includes the following: the agreement provides for two possible durations; whereas the proviso to paragraph 3 provides for a unanimous decision “to extend this period”. the two concepts are wholly different. extending “this period” is one outcome; two possible durations, without any certainty, are certainly something else, not authorised anywhere in article 50. if one can have two hypothetical durations, can one make an agreement under article 50 which includes more than two durations – a kind of take your pick deal? it is obvious that such an arrangement would be incompatible with the need for an orderly, or credible exit from the eu. the conclusion, i would suggest, is that the agreement used and implemented by the prime minister, mr barnier and president tusk was unlawful and ultra vires article 50. it was without any legal foundation in accordance with article 50. purporting to use their agreement as compliance with the requirements of article 50, paragraph 3, and in particular its proviso, was unsustainable. that meant that the illegal nature and purpose of the agreement invalidated it; there was no unanimous decision to “extend this period”. the requirements of article 50 were ignored. it was not an application to extend this period as required by the proviso. our learned friend also takes issue with the advice given by civil servants to parliament (well, the house of commons iuam) about what was going on around the various extensions, i have added some emphasis: 5.2 next, on or about the 14th march the government issued a note entitled parameters of extending article 50. it contained inter alia the following statement: “what are the legal requirements for an article 50 extension set out in the eu treaties? the article 50 period is set at 2 years unless, as provided for in article 50 “the european council, in agreement with the member state concerned, unanimously decides to extend [it]”. article 50 does not establish any upper limit on the length of an extension. however, given the article 50 period is explicitly time-limited, any extension would have to set a specific end date, because it is necessary for reasons of legal certainty to be clear on the date on which the uk will leave the eu.” 5.3 it is at this point that there occurs a curious mishap. the first and second lines of the quotation purport to be an accurate reproduction of article 50. they are not. if one looks at article 50, it is apparent that the last three words of paragraph 3 are “extend this period”; but in the quotation the last two words are “extend [it]”. so the version put out by the civil servants was false. the differences in meaning between the two versions were considerable. (a) the true version under this version the ec and the member state can agree to extend “this period”. this period is the two year period after which the member state ceases to be a member of the eu automatically. but it would appear that the power to extend article 50 can only be used once; “this period” appears to be limited to the two year period, making it clear that no further extensions to article 50 could be made. that would certainly curtail any power to make any further extension. (b) the false version the last four words of this version of article 50 now read “decides to extend it”. the wording of this version is apt to enable the prime minister to seek as many extensions to the article 50 process as she wishes; she is no longer inhibited by the restrictions contained in article 50. it is relevant to point out that in the parameters paper there appears this statement at paragraph 2: “this paper provides a factual summary to inform parliament’s debate on that motion”. 5.4 so the civil servants responsible for briefing parliament to enable an informed debate to take place, themselves were misleading it. the alteration of the text of article 50, and of the proviso to paragraph 3, must have been deliberate. the beneficiary of this misconduct was the prime minister, who could and did arrange for extensions of time without hindrance. the text of the parameters paper makes it clear that the civil servants had no qualms about extensions or their supposed length and legal foundation. october 31st 2019 is the latest. this is a truly alarming state of affairs; it should be exposed sooner rather than later. in summary, he includes the following: (i) the application by the prime minister for an extension of time until june 30th under the proviso to article 50, made on or about the 14th march 2019, was legally valid, but was rejected by the eu. (ii) this was followed by the agreement proposed by the eu. it did not comply with the terms of the proviso; nor was article 50 referred to or relied on by the eu. it was not effective to stop the article 50 process running up to and including the 29th march at 11 p.m. whichever way one looks at it, the agreement was either unlawful or made for an unlawful purpose or ultra vires .that means that the uk left the eu on the 29th march 2019 by default as there was no valid or lawful impediment to prevent it. i am not aware of any proposals to test these arguments by seeking a declaration from the high court, which would be the usual method for deciding a question of law regarding the uk’s affairs. i would say that even if these arguments have merit, i am afraid that i doubt that any application would get a fair hearing in the uk. however, wouldn’t it be a superb outcome for mrs may to have taken us out of the eu by accident without realising, and therefore to have resigned by mistake, should she carry out that avowed intent? she would become the ultimate, universal champion clusterf*ck politician of all time, although she’s probably made that podium already. addendum: apl points out that there is apparently a legal case brought by robin tilbrook of the english democrats. the most that i can find about his case, which appears to rely on some other matters, is here. june 3rd, 2019 | 28 comments - (comments are closed) resisting ethnic prejudice by other means niall kilmartin (stirling) · european affairs · european union · german affairs germany resists islamophobia. german law seeks to purge the public domain of such offensive views. germany also resists anti-semitism. the german government’s anti-semitism commissioner has warned jews to avoid being jewish in public. the bbc sees the german far right behind the rise in anti-semitism that prompted the commissioner’s advice. is it just me or are they ignoring a rival explanation?

or have you kept your faith strong? have you converted to this belief? april 11th, 2019 | 75 comments - (comments are closed) leaving the eu – a jersey jaunt and a guernsey gallivant mr ed · anglosphere · antics & parties · european affairs · european union · french affairs · german affairs · historical views · monarchy · religion · uk affairs rightly not trusting our leaders to deliver on their statements (there were, ifuc, no promises about leaving the eu from mrs may), the sage of kettering and i have left the eu in that recently, we have visited our nearest escape hole, the channel islands. a fleeting visit, one day in each, but we have seen a future, and it works, more or less. for our more distant readers, jersey and guernsey are ‘crown dependencies’, historically part of the duchy of normandy, owing allegiance to the british crown but not part of the uk. the uk government has arrogated to itself the overlordship of the islands, holding responsibility for foreign affairs and defence (well, sort of, as we shall see), but the two bailiwicks are otherwise independent jurisdictions with autonomy in most areas, crucially taxation, and are outside of the european union, albeit within eu customs arrangements, allowing them to trade with the eu. here, they say, the queen is the duke of normandy, although monuments refer to ‘la reine’. she is the only duke i can think of married to a duke. whether or not they can simply declare independence is constitutionally unclear, but with labour dangerously close to power, they might be advised to make some plans. → continue reading: leaving the eu – a jersey jaunt and a guernsey gallivant march 31st, 2019 | 27 comments - (comments are closed) enemies everywhere rob fisher (surrey) · european affairs · internet lovers of liberty are surrounded by enemies. paul marks posted a video by tech and social commentary youtuber computing forever explaining possible consequences of yesterday’s votes on articles 11 and 13 of the eu copyright directive. i am also fond of the gaming youtuber obsidianant, who is less certain but still worried. it is unclear how this directive will be implemented, but it seems awfully unpleasant. even if this is not the end of the internet, regulations have ratcheted a little bit more and there is no sign of any future change in direction. at best, life will be made harder for small content creators and innovation will be stifled. youtube, i suspect, will make a minimum effort to implement tougher content filters which will annoy the big channels and kill off marginal smaller ones. google will pay the occasional big fine since the system will be impossible to implement perfectly. some other content sharing platforms will exit the eu or be killed off. all kinds of unseen new things will never come to be. to some extent rules like the link tax will be ignored and not enforced, except against people who are sufficiently unpopular. to some extent people will work around the directive, and in response the eu will try to tighten regulations further. this is a great example of just how hard it is for grass roots efforts to change the minds of the european commission. years of campaigning could not stop the directive. i can not imagine any way the direction of travel can be reversed. the eu is making a really good case for brexit. on the other hand, when asked, the british government responded: “we support articles 11 and 13, which seek to ensure creators and producers are rewarded when their works are used online, but agree they must include safeguards for freedom of expression.” i do see any sign of safeguards. will the uk government now refuse to implement the directive during the transition period? boris is against it, at least. meanwhile, some more eu plans are afoot to fit cars with speed limiters and black boxes. “the department for transport said the system would also apply in the uk, despite brexit.” the british government may not be much better for liberty than the eu and in some cases may be worse, but i can at least imagine how it might be possible to change it. i think we need to get out of the eu so we can concentrate on opposing opponents of liberty in westminster. perhaps in a few weeks we will have some idea how close a prospect that is. march 28th, 2019 | 13 comments - (comments are closed) older entries » who are we?
