she then expressed her remorse over the situation, saying: ‚Äúi want to offer my sincere and heartfelt apology for the insensitivity i showed in my previous post to the very real suffering and fear that has gripped the world through covid19. grandparents, parents, children, sisters and brothers are dying, the world is rallying to find a way to stop this very real threat, and my ensuing silence has sent a dismissive, arrogant and cryptic message‚Ä¶ my direct and special apologies to those most affected by this pandemic. i never meant to hurt you. when i wrote that post 10 days ago, i thought i was infusing calm into the hysteria. i can see now that i was projecting my own fears into an already fearful and traumatic situation.‚Äù the 40-year-old continued by saying she was ‚Äúgrieved by the ongoing loss of life‚Äù and other continued complications of the pandemic, and fearful for the political ramifications that will occur. however, she said: ‚Äúat the same time, i am heartened by the beauty and humanity i see so many people demonstrating toward one another in this vulnerable time. when i was grappling with my own fears over social distancing, one kind, wise and gracious person said to me ‚Äòdo it out of love, not fear‚Äô and it helped me to realize my place in all this.‚Äù lilly concluded the post by sending love to all her followers, ‚Äúeven if you can‚Äôt return it right now.‚Äù related: taylor & ariana donate to fans affected by coronavirus the avenger was (rightfully!) slammed for her insensitive comments, most notably from instagram‚Äôs favorite tea-spiller, sophie turner. mrs. joe jonas had particularly strong words for evangeline, even if she didn‚Äôt name her: ‚Äústay inside, don‚Äôt be f**king stupid. even if you count your ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô over your health. i don‚Äôt give a f**k about your freedom, you could be infecting other people, other vulnerable people around you. so stay inside guys. it‚Äôs not cool, and it‚Äôs not clever. and that‚Äôs the tea.‚Äù lilly‚Äôs lost co-stars had some things to say about it, too. fans praised maggie grace for a comment she left on the original post, where she encouraged lilly to ‚Äútrust the extensive science‚Äù about the disease: ‚Äúsure, it‚Äôs a free country, but how about choosing to exercise some of that wonderful freedom to have some compassion, trust the extensive science here and not overwhelm health system [sic]. ‚Ä¶ i say this with all humility , please rethink this. your kids will be just fine without going to gymnastics, i promise . :)‚Äù grace also name-dropped their co-star daniel dae kim, who has been diagnosed with the disease: ‚Äúps daniel said he is doing a lot better btw . i don‚Äôt know, maybe you guys wanna chat?‚Äù maggie grace slams her lost co-star‚Äôs ‚Äúconcerning‚Äù post / (c) evangeline lilly/instagram meanwhile, josh holloway posted his own lost-related coronavirus message to instagram on thursday. in what seems like a subtle dig at freckles, the pic shows a side-by-side of a still from the show with a faux-script that reads: ‚Äúext. survivors beach ‚Äì day. peaceful ocean breeze. cut to: jack and sawyer playing cards on the beach. sawyer: just me, you and the mangoes, doc. jack: yup. that‚Äôs what a quarantine is all about, sawyer.‚Äù shade? who knows, everything about that show was confusing!

she claimed she‚Äôs ‚Äútrying to follow responsible recommendations for how to help,‚Äù so hopefully some good can come out of this messy situation. ch-ch-check out the apology post for yourself (below)! view this post on instagram hello everyone. i am writing you from my home where i have been social distancing since mar 18th ‚Äì when social distancing was instituted in the small community where i am currently living. at the time of my mar 16th post, the directives from the authorities here were that we not congregate in groups of more than 250ppl and that we wash our hands regularly, which we were doing. two days later, those directives changed and, despite my intense trepidation over the socioeconomic and political repercussions of this course of action, please know i am doing my part to flatten the curve, practicing social distancing and staying home with my family. i want to offer my sincere and heartfelt apology for the insensitivity i showed in my previous post to the very real suffering and fear that has gripped the world through covid19. grandparents, parents, children, sisters and brothers are dying, the world is rallying to find a way to stop this very real threat, and my ensuing silence has sent a dismissive, arrogant and cryptic message. my direct and special apologies to those most affected by this pandemic. i never meant to hurt you. when i wrote that post 10 days ago, i thought i was infusing calm into the hysteria. i can see now that i was projecting my own fears into an already fearful and traumatic situation. i am grieved by the ongoing loss of life, and the impossible decisions medical workers around the world must make as they treat those affected. i am concerned for our communities ‚Äì small businesses and families living paycheck-to-paycheck ‚Äì and i am trying to follow responsible recommendations for how to help. like many of you, i fear for the political aftermath of this pandemic, and i am praying for us all. at the same time, i am heartened by the beauty and humanity i see so many people demonstrating toward one another in this vulnerable time. when i was grappling with my own fears over social distancing, one kind, wise and gracious person said to me ‚Äúdo it out of love, not fear‚Äù and it helped me to realize my place in all of this. sending love to all of you, even if you can‚Äôt return it right now. el a post shared by evangeline lilly (@evangelinelillyofficial) on mar 26, 2020 at 1:29pm pdt [image via fayesvision/wenn.] related posts nicole richie talks at-home schooling during coronavirus: ‚Äòi spent 10 years preaching no screens‚Äô priyanka chopra explains the one rule she & nick jonas follow to make their marriage work!
