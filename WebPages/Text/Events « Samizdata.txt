get any emails? read any stories about issues that concern women around the world, ranging from employment law through to their treatment in certain parts of the world? well i did, but i was struck by how low-temperature it all was. the press releases that i received had a sort of “they are just phoning it in” quality. because whatever else one can say about this event, in recent years it appeared to loom quite large in my life in the media/wealth management world. there is usually lots of commentary about “pay gaps” (a fertile area for the misleading use of data, not to mention a lot of questionable assumptions). not so much this year. it all felt a bit, well, lame. and it is not just because of covid-19, although that obviously is a part of it. certain harsh facts of reality have broken through our “woke” obsessions. (the virus appears to hit men harder than women, which violates a prime directive of modern feminism, that no evidence should be provided that suggests men and women are different other than in strict issues around making babies, unless the difference is to show that men are more “toxic”, reckless, etc.) the day – 8 march – was also a sunday, so a curiously odd day for such an event when a working day might make more sense (well, sunday is a working day in muslim nations, but not in the west for most people). i don’t know whether there is just plain exhaustion out there about the endless claims that men wield all the power, have the best jobs, are “toxic”, that films, music, tv, the sale of services, etc, are all about men, and that this all needs to change. the truth in fact is that in much of the west, this process of complaining about men has gone on so long that fatigue is setting in when the rhetoric does not quite stack up against reality. according to consultancy and research firm frost and sullivan, women owners will account for 40 per cent of all registered businesses worldwide this year. in my financial services industry, they account for an increasingly important client base in terms of assets under management. this is particularly the case in regions such as asia. to take a more philosophical turn here, those of us on the classical liberal/libertarian end of the spectrum should remind folk that our starting point is that life isn’t a zero-sum game. if women succeed more in business or in sports, it is not at the expense of men, nor should it be. also, if the percentage share of women in occupation/area a is greater than, or less than, that of men as a share of the total population, that is not ipso facto proof that something terrible has happened, and that this must be corrected. for it ignores how entirely free acts at the individual level can have an impact that might appear “disproportionate” at the macro one. at no stage was deliberate worsening/bettering of group intended, because this was not done with reference to a group outcome in the first place. what the “proportionate share” egalitarians would demand is that none of us should interact with another person unless we have gone through some sort of meta-choice process of sifting through a pre-approved “menu”, whether it is hiring an employee, checking out a date on a dating app, etc. for example, how many people should a guy choose from before making a “fair” choice of a woman to go out with and who should set this sample? if he chooses, to stick with the dating example, to say he does not want to date single mothers or those who paint their hair green, or who are clinically obese, or rail-thin, or whatever, who is to say that he should not? and if the man in question decides to stop using such apps, do the old-fashioned thing instead and meet women in bars or social events, who on earth is in a position to screen that? i think a failure to understand things like this is behind bad ideas such as the state seeking to mandate how many women/others should sit on company boards, regardless of how that effectively violates freedom of firms to hire and invite whom they want. even if adverts for certain jobs forbid certain likes and dislikes being expressed, as anyone knows preferences can and are still expressed in who gets a job. it is very hard to control this; the best “solution” to this issue is to have as competitive a labour market as possible: capitalism is the best solvent of irrational dislikes/likes of people, because it is a cost. back to more current matters, it does appear that for all the supposed march of identity politics, some countries are, much to the dislike of some, resistant if the quality of candidates is poor. consider the us. the country in november faces a choice between the incumbent, whom we are told is a moron, orange man bad. and yet the ladies haven’t made much of a dent. the best that the democrats can come up with at this point are two ageing male lefties, one of whom is a largely – as far as i know – unrepentant communist and fan of fidel castro, and the other a creep with allegedly wandering hands who might have early-stage dementia. the women on the democratic race, such as elizabeth warren (who absurdly played a native american indian identity card, and got hammered for it), and kamala harris, fell by the wayside as their flaws became all too evident. (ok, tulsi gabbard is just about hanging on, but not for long. none of them, to be blunt about it, is a maggie.) iwd has caused people from different parts of the ideological spectrum, by the way, to claim that this or that group/viewpoint they dislike has “hijacked” it. take this example from progress, the uk magazine, in 2016, and more recently, from the daily telegraph. of course, if you want to wind certain people up, as i do in my less mature moments, one way to say that we should mark iwd is to salute the rise of uk home secretary priti patel, even if you aren’t that sold on her points-based approach to immigration. triggered! march 10th, 2020 | 12 comments lawyers having a riot – in a hospital – some killed mr ed · antics & parties · events · health & medical · how very odd! · indian subcontinent · sui generis i am surprised that this story from pakistan – perhaps this is real ‘lawfare’? – three die as marauding pakistan lawyers rampage through cardiac hospital has not gained more attention, there is a paywall but there is other coverage. the gist of it is that after a dispute at a cardiac unit over priority for treatment, and insults being traded between physicians and lawyers, a riot of lawyers ensued that the pakistani police could only contain with military assistance, and there are unconfirmed reports of patients dying after either being attacked by lawyers or deserted by medical staff. breitbart has the story too, with a death toll of around 12. a mob of two hundred lawyers attacked the punjab institute of cardiology (pic) in lahore, pakistan, on wednesday, causing at least 12 deaths, several of them critical care patients whose treatments were interrupted by the riot. the swarm of lawyers was armed with firebombs and a number of handguns. police cars were set ablaze during their confrontation with riot police, while the hospital suffered damage to windows, doors, and delicate equipment inside. the genesis of the dispute is reported as being: the bizarre rampage was touched off by a scuffle on tuesday that sounds like a comedy skit gone horribly wrong: a lawyer demanded priority treatment at the hospital, the doctors said no, and the lawyer marched off to the local police station to demand they arrest the recalcitrant doctors on terrorism charges. when the police said no, the infuriated lawyer returned to the hospital with some of his colleagues for a confrontation with the doctors, who filmed the ensuing confrontation and posted the video online with commentary mocking the lawyers. the following day, a mob of two hundred enraged lawyers descended upon the hospital and began trashing everything from parked cars to medical equipment. so the good news is that pakistan’s police have a firmer grasp of the concept of the rule of law than this gang of lawyers. the hospital itself is the punjab institute of cardiology, which provides free health care to almost 500,000 patients a year. presumably it is state-funded, but there may be some religious charitable giving. it does accept donations for patient welfare, and provides private treatment in the evenings. so why couldn’t the uppity lawyer who started this have waited till the evening and paid for some private care? there may be more to this than meets the eye, the article alludes to long-running tensions between lawyers and doctors in lahore (but no reason for them). a local lawyers’ rep. doesn’t seem to be particularly conciliatory: the vice chair of the pakistan bar council, syed amjad shah, condemned the violence but described it as “the individual act of a few lawyers” while blaming the doctors for starting the fight by “misbehaving.” presumably the ‘lawyer’ pictured pointing a pistol in this local piece fully complies with the rules of professional conduct? in the usa, he might be simply vigorously demonstrating the second amendment. what is the answer to this sort of behaviour, apart from rigorous law enforcement? it is, i suppose, a backhanded compliment to pakistan’s hospitals that people will kill if denied priority treatment. why doesn’t the nhs provoke such passions? december 12th, 2019 | 9 comments - (comments are closed) the fall of the temple of reason mr ed · architecture · events · french affairs · historical views · religion terrible news from paris of the fire at notre-dame cathedral. as i write, i understand that not all is lost of this masterpiece. the collapsed spire was a 19th century addition, but the damage must be immense. when i was last in paris, over a decade ago, i recall looking at notre-dame and shuddering as i thought of it as ‘destroyed’ (not that i believe that there are ‘holy’ places), as, during the french revolution, it was closed as a cathedral and was declared a temple of reason. when egalitarians appeal to reason, you know heads will roll. there followed years of neglect, before, aiui, in 1905, the french state (which had assumed ownership), effectively provided the cathedral to the catholic church as a permanent ‘tenant’. the cause of the fire may well be nothing more sinister than incompetence, perhaps we will never know. i would like to think that commercial aviation levels of caution would go into fire precautions in such a building, (perhaps they did) which, whatever your view of the use or purpose of it, is surely one of the great buildings on earth. however, the neglect under state ownership has continued, and yesterday’s cathedral was a revived corpse of the pre-revolutionary building. it is pretty shameful that neither hitler nor the kaiser managed to do as much damage to notre dame as the fire. it had survived them, and rioting hugenots. in ww2, it was relatively unscathed. some lost mediaeval glass was, i understand, replaced by abstract crap in the post-war period, so the scoundrels were already circling. perhaps the fire is a randian moment, wasn’t there a train crash in a tunnel for which ‘no one is responsible’? is the burning down of a ‘temple of reason’ an allegory for france after its great economists are all-but forgotten? does it matter if, in rebuilding notre-dame, stone that is geologically ancient is replaced by other just as ancient stone, carved a few mere centuries later? should, as with the campanile in venice, the order be: ‘com’era, dov’era.‘. ‘how it was, where it was.‘? or will something more ‘inclusive’ replace it or be grated on to it? april 15th, 2019 | 47 comments - (comments are closed) atlas shrugs as sark faces the shocking truth about price controls mr ed · civil liberty & regulation · events · french affairs · mindless "inequality" blather · monarchy · science & technology · self ownership the island of sark, a small, remote channel island, with a population somewhere around 500, part of the duchy of normandy and the bailiwick of guernsey, but almost entirely autonomous, noted for not having any cars, having been one the last feudal jurisdictions in the world and having had very low taxes, is currently in crisis over its electricity supply. the problem can be summed up in two words ‘price control’. sark is taking on the appearance of a small, cooler, oil-free venezuela (or perhaps a preview of corbyn’s – or even may’s- uk in 2022). it even has the example of france, home of ‘égalité‘, the guillotine and generally poor economic ideas (and some excellent ones), a few miles away over the choppy channel. it will no doubt not surprise almost all our readers that sark, having in recent years had democracy foisted on it, has got a legislature (28-strong) that seems to think that it has solutions to problems. the islanders have also found that as the price of electricity has risen in recent years, and as people have not been happy with the sole supplier to the island, they have been generating their own power. falling demand has led to higher unit costs for the supplier, which creates a vicious circle. enter the commissioner established and authorised, nay, required, under the the control of electricity prices (sark) law, 2016 to look into the price of electricity and to set a ‘fair and reasonable price’. looking at his powers more closely we see that they are in fact, nothing short of miraculous, under section 13: determination of fair and reasonable price. 13. (1) following completion of an investigation under this law, the commissioner shall, determine whether a price which is charged by a regulated electricity supplier for the supply of electricity is, or is not, fair and reasonable. (2) in determining whether a price is, or is not, fair and reasonable the commissioner shall take all material considerations into account, including without limitation the following matters – (a) the cost of generating and distributing the supply of electricity, including the cost of – (i) acquisition and maintenance of any plant and equipment, (ii) fuel and other consumables, and (iii) labour, required to generate the supply, (b) the replacement cost of any plant and equipment required to generate and distribute the supply, (c) the quality and reliability of the supply of electricity and the economy and efficiency with which the supply of electricity is generated and distributed, (d) the margin of profit obtained by the regulated electricity supplier, (e) the margin of profit obtained by such other electricity suppliers, generating and distributing a supply of electricity in similar circumstances in such other islands or territories, as the commissioner thinks fit, (f) the entitlement of the regulated electricity supplier to receive such reasonable return, as the commissioner thinks fit, on the value of assets (including plant and equipment and working capital) operated or used by the supplier for the purpose of generating and distributing the supply, and (g) any representations made in response to a request given under section 14, or otherwise. funnily enough, he is not expressly directed to consider the laws of economics, or supply and demand. you can see where this is going i am sure. so why can’t the fools on sark? how many thousand of years and examples will it take? here we have the closest thing to a laboratory for economics, 500 or so ‘lab mice’, and yet we already know how it ends. here is his consultation paper. so cutting to the chase, a price control has been issued, and the island’s sole electricity provider intends to close on 30th november 2018, as they are losing £20,000 a month supplying power at the ‘fair and reasonable‘ (and that’s official) price. may i introduce here, the managing director of the sark electricity company ltd, mr atlas shrugger (i jest), his name is… mr gordon-brown (david being his first name), and his company wishes to challenge the commissioner’s decision. sel was to mount a legal battle against the commissioner move this december. however, a review of the company’s financial affairs by its independent auditors found that although the company could withstand the temporary £20,000 loss per month caused by a new 52p price for electricity, sel could not afford to mount the legal case at the same time. back in december, the tariff was set at 69p per unit. ‘we have already suffered through a 40% decline in consumption caused by sark’s economic collapse and we cannot cut our costs any further,’ said sel managing director david gordon-brown. ‘a 25% price cut for a company that has already lost £65,000 this year is obviously unmanageable. ‘attempting to operate the company under these conditions would be a breach of my responsibilities as a company director.’ he said if chief pleas wanted the company to continue providing power, it would have to provide for the cost of fighting the commissioner order. ‘we cannot operate the company at a loss over £20,000 a month under the new pricing scheme nor can we find the money necessary to fund the legal fight.’ he added that if chief pleas did not come to the table as a financial backer in time, it would be required to shut down, leaving the island without water or electricity. this, i understand, is because the cost of a legal challenge (in this tiny island) to the regulator would be in the region of £250,000, and mr gordon-brown has asked the chief pleas (the parliament of sark) to fund a legal challenge to the body established by the parliament, as obviously, his company can’t afford that sort of money. can anyone else see the obvious short-cut here, the one that doesn’t involve legal fees? mr gordon-brown was reported last december as saying: david gordon-brown, the manager of sark electricity, says the recommendation by the island’s first electricity regular to reduce electricity prices tells “a story of betrayal”. for the past eight years the people of sark have been betrayed by a committee of incomers with so little understanding of sark that they expect electricity prices here to be comparable to their experience in the uk. now the company has been betrayed by a commissioner with so little understanding of sark that he expects the costs of producing electricity here to be comparable to his experience in the uk. the commissioner is doubtless a dedicated and decent chap, committed to fulfilling his statutory duty, he is only following the law and only giving orders, safe, as it happens, in his home in long buckby, northamptonshire, england. but has the commissioner considered economies of scale, transportation costs, economic law and reality? does he have to? the situation now is that the electricity company is shutting down on 30th november 2018, and they supply water. i have to say that all those who voted for those who voted in this law, and those who voted it in and implement it, are quite simply, fully deserving of their adumbrated trip back to the stone age. i would propose evacuating from sark all those who opposed it, or were too young (or insane) to know better (i.e. under 16), and leaving the rest to enjoy their new, low prices. to keep us safe from contamination, we should establish an an air and sea blockade, and air-drop a copy of bastiat’s writings so that they may learn the error of their ways. socialism (or price fixing) is just slow-motion cannibalism. it looks like sark is heading that way, by choice. but as the bbc reported, they did have this terrible problem: in august 2018, sark electricity was forced to lower its price by 14p to 52p per kilowatt hour (kw/h) after the island’s electricity price commissioner found the cost “neither fair nor reasonable”. despite the reduction, sark residents still pay significantly more than the 17p per kw/h in nearby guernsey or the uk the average of 14p. meanwhile over in jersey, the press speculate about the evacuation of the island. asked if there was a real possibility of people having to leave sark, mr raymond -(deputy chairman of sark’s policy and finance committee)- replied: ‘not if we can get our contingency plans in place. ‘they are in the development stage at the moment so i can’t give out too much detail, but it will involve consolidating around certain centres – making sure there are certain buildings that have power so people can congregate there. it really is a war-time mentality. do you really expect people to be living like this in the 21st century?’ yes, i do, because if they are socialist dickheads implementing their plans, they will eventually get what is coming to them, good and hard. november 18th, 2018 | 31 comments - (comments are closed) a ‘fourth amendment’ is badly needed, back in the old country mr ed · events · opinions on liberty · privacy & panopticon · self ownership · uk affairs king george iii’s troops and excise men outraged many of the colonialists (aiui) with their searches and seizures, leading to the fourth amendment to the us constitution. amendment iv the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. back in old england, no such definitive right exists, so the queen’s men may find you not so secure in your person, and may make ‘unreasonable searches and seizures’, you might conclude. i call my first ‘witness’: a prisoner suspected of hiding drugs by swallowing them has been sent to hospital after managing not to defecate for nearly seven weeks. #poowatch ends in victory for suspected drug dealer as he’s released on bail after 45 days without going to the toilet yes, the unfortunate mr lamarr chambers was held as a prisoner for 45 days by essex police, hoping that he will drop himself in it, as it were, as he was suspected of having swallowed an item which would eventually emerge, and which might incriminate him on drugs charges (and i note, we don’t have a fifth amendment here either, but we do have some rules of evidence against self-incrimination). the story so far: the 24-year-old from brixton, south london, was held on january 17 and appeared in court the next day. at that hearing, and in seven subsequent hearings, the court authorised the further detention of mr chambers under section 152 of the criminal justice act 1988 to enable him to pass drugs he was suspected to have inside him. so a court has authorised this epic buttock-clenching saga, under legislation dating from mrs thatcher’s period in office. however, the police, presumably feeling themselves up against a brick wall, relented. on monday the decision was taken by deputy chief constable bj harrington, following medical and legal advice, to release mr chambers from custody. the crown prosecution service discontinued the charges against mr chambers in relation to possession with intent to supply a class a drug and driving matters. he was immediately rearrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a class a drug and released on bail and then taken by police car, in company with a medical professional, to hospital for treatment. i can’t help but be disgusted by a country in which a police force can comment on twitter about a prisoner’s bowel movements, or lack thereof. perhaps we need a change in the law? no holding people until evidence emerges, but charge on the evidence lawfully and properly gathered. or perhaps mrs may might suggest that the crown will be able to seek a writ of habeus caco, ordering a prisoner to defecate? i suspect that there’s only one thing mr chambers needs now more badly than the fourth amendment. and what do the police say? ‘we will also not shy away from talking about the unpleasant truths that go hand in hand with the drug dealing lifestyle, from the violence often perpetrated by those involved to the expectation on dealers to “plug” drugs to avoid capture.’ i find a police force watching a man 24-hours a day for 45 days to see him defecate (on these allegations) far more unpleasant a truth, a truth about the state of freedom in britain today. march 7th, 2018 | 21 comments - (comments are closed) life under communism… perry de havilland (london) · events adriana lukas, intermittently of this parish, will be giving a chat on the cheerful subject of life under communism. turn up and meet assorted samizdataistas at this libertarian home meetup event in london, tuesday, december 5, 2017, 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm! december 4th, 2017 | 6 comments - (comments are closed) the poppy is not a symbol of remembrance… patrick crozier (twickenham) · events · sports · uk affairs …it is a symbol that the bearer has made a donation to the royal british legion’s haig fund. i thought it might be worth pointing that out bearing in mind recent kerfuffles. november 2nd, 2016 | 24 comments - (comments are closed) tunnel vision – switzerland vs the united kingdom mr ed · european affairs · events · historical views · transport · uk affairs if tunnel building were an olympic support, i suspect that switzerland would bestride the top step of the podium and its virtually unknown national anthem would blare out to the cheering crowd, thrilled by the culmination of a 20-year slog of building the gotthard base tunnel, the world’s longest rail tunnel, which opens today, co-incidentally the anniversary of a british naval triumph against the french, the glorious first of june (with those rebellious colonists being involved tangentially). this twin-bore tunnel opened on time and within budget, and it runs level and almost straight through the varying geology of 35 miles of swiss mountain, a fantastic achievement, but with sadly 9 deaths, but that seems very low over 20 years and 35 miles. if it can be traversed, per reports, in 17 minutes, that’s an average speed of over 120mph. the idea is to get lorries crossing the alps through switzerland off the swiss roads. switzerland is, of course, (along with liechtenstein) surrounded by the european union but outside it. and meanwhile, as the swiss literally give geology both barrels, in england, we have our glorious channel tunnel and the channel ports (as the sage of kettering relayed to me once ‘the problem with the channel tunnel is that it has a government at both ends.‘). well, today a house of commons committee has come up with a rather skeptical report about a new plan to cope with cross-channel traffic. for those who do not drive in the south-east of england, there is a standing plan in place to cope with the vagaries of the joys of free movement of goods in the glorious european union whenever the channel tunnel runs into a problem (e.g. when the french start horsing around, burning sheep etc.), called ‘operation stack’, where the kent police close an entire motorway, the m20, and park lorries bound for the continent on it pending the cessation of hostilities, typically a period of 5 days of so, when a major motorway becomes a lorry park, and to hell with the locals. part of the m20 was used 32 times last summer by queuing lorries – a process known as operation stack. the british answer to this problem is, of course, to shell calais and demand its return to english control (er, no), it is to build a 65 hectare lorry park at a cost of £250,000,000. this would be as big as disneyland (the one in california) and bigger than the vatican (a mere 44 hectares) and with the added bonus of no pope. it will allow 4,000 lorries to be parked whilst the benighted lorry drivers await the restoration of normality. one might ask why each lorry space would cost £62,500 (c.$90,000 us)? do we see here cultural differences between the uk and switzerland? the acceptance of failure and its normalisation, a tendency towards inflated cost and an attitude of weary resignation, against a positive can-do attitude that bulldozes through problems. so why can’t we be like switzerland? postscript: eric’s comment indicates that the swiss may not have been above a bit of creative accounting in completing the tunnel on time and in budget, for which i am grateful, i may have been misled by the bbc (which in cyrillic was the acronym for the soviet army airborne forces, what a co-incidence). june 1st, 2016 | 15 comments - (comments are closed) the ‘clownocracy’ – modern britain on show mr ed · environment · events · how very odd! · sports a couple of unrelated incidents, and a political milestone all in the news today appear to me to sum up the ascendency of the ‘clown class’ in modern britain, where personal responsibility and personal dignity appear to be outmoded notions. firstly, after a bomb scare led to the abandonment of the last football match of the premier league season between manchester united and bournemouth, it appears to have turned out that the realistic but inert suspect device found just before kick-off was in fact a practice bomb left by a company engaged to plant suspect devices as part of a security drill. but this was only found out long after the event and after the army had carried out a controlled explosion on the device. what part of counting them all out and counting them all in was too hard to organise? did no one remember the drill? secondly, it appears that a senior woman police officer in greater manchester police has been suspended after attending a conference on women in policing. assistant chief constable rebekah sutcliffe has been suspended after the alleged “inappropriate behaviour” following a reported row with superintendent sarah jackson. the pair are said to have become embroiled in a “loud disagreement” over who had the “best boobs” while attending the senior women in policing conference. quite how this would be a breach of police discipline, even if the alleged incident happened, is not immediately clear. however, acc sutcliffe has been reported as saying: “i’ve nothing to say. this is an incredibly stressful time.” thereby immediately contradicting herself. and grammarians may ponder if she ought to have said ‘better boobs’ rather than ‘best’ as surely the comparative applies, rather than the superlative? but if this is a stressful time, what on earth are you doing in policing? try something really stressful, like bomb disposal, like lt-cdr john bridge gc gm and bar. he would have come in handy at old trafford yesterday. and finally, natalie bennett is not going to stand for re-election as leader of the green party when her term expires. so the party memorably described as ‘communism for middle-class women’ will have a new leader. so the schadenfreudefest of ms bennett being interviewed (very softly i think) on any topic may no longer be repeated so as to expose the greens for what they stand for, banning anything that they can think of. this of course may be a negative development in terms of the political landscape, but why didn’t she either resign at the time or stand on her record? may 16th, 2016 | 28 comments - (comments are closed) manoeuvring the benevolent laissez faire conference perry de havilland (london) · events since brian is busy exploring rooftops and mountains in the south of france, it is my turn to be “nudged” by conference organiser simon gibbs whose event is running this saturday (may 14th). as brian predicted simon has indeed been busy, not least sorting out a new venue – de morgan house, on russell square. problems with a floor, or something. make sure you go the right place. it is also interesting that the event has won over a new speaker – syed kamall. syed has always kept good company by attending the right events and has impeccable free-market credentials. that he has made it to quite a senior position and is continuing to speak at such events is a compliment to the man. in case you never heard of him, he has been mep for london for years, rose to chair a bit of the eu parliament, and lately stood against green lunatic zac goldsmith for the tory mayoral nomination. he would have made a much better candidate. he also, amusingly, pissed off the right people, including david cameron and his own eu counterpart guy verhofstadt (triggering the daily mail to use a big red warning). syed is very serious about making sure his constituents know how to solve problems without relying on people like himself – solving their problems outside politics. that he is coming to say this at “benevolent laissez faire” is a great compliment to the event. fair enough: under one roof are syed, two blockchain-enabled anarchists, the second most senior randian, and a certain “doctor anton howes” (whose name sounds familiar). looks like a fun way to spend a saturday afternoon! may 11th, 2016 | 4 comments - (comments are closed) benevolent laissez faire conference on may 14th brian micklethwait (london) · economics, business & globalization · events · opinions on liberty i am being nudged by simon gibbs, who is organising it, to say something here, now, about this libertarian home event, about and against taxation. this event will happen on the afternoon of saturday may 14th, in holborn, london. the speakers (see the list here) will include: yaron brook; anton howes; and a couple of new names to me, “janina lowisz, bitnation and julio alejandro, humanitarian blockchain”. sounds intriguing, in a twenty first century and good way. i’m guessing that the gist of what they may say will be that the internet makes it possible for things to be crowd-funded and micro-financed and generally supported in ways that not long ago were impossible, and that modern life thus offers even greater opportunities to chip away at and to improve upon the tax-and-spend state, both ideologically and in practice. you could sum those speakers up by saying that there is no need for high taxes in the future (lowisz, alejandro), there was no need for high taxes in the past (howes), and there is no excuse for high taxes ever (brook). that nudging i mentioned at the start of this posting is worth emphasising. based on how a similar event in october 2014 went, which simon gibbs also organised, simon will do whatever he needs to do, having already lined up some good speakers for may 14th, to get also a good throng of people to listen to them and to mingle with and to network with one another. the cost of a ticket is, if you book now, £12, and there is a basic sense in which attenders will be paying their £12 for all that nudging that simon is now doing, to ensure that this event is a success. the most helpful way that you can support simon and his nudging would be, if you now know that you want to attend, to book your own ticket, now. to tell simon, now, that you will be attending, go here, and click on the bigger and lower of the two red rectangles saying: “join us!” i could expand, on the wrongs of taxation, on the particular excellence of anton howes as a speaker and as an up-and-coming libertarian historian and intellectual, on how interesting and how well organised and welcoming that october 2014 event was (at which yaron brook also spoke), and how many attended it, and so on and so forth, but simon wants the word on this latest event on may 14th to spread now, and he wants this posting to go up now. so, up it goes, now. taxation is of course a very topical subject just now. if you want more tax talk here, try this. april 15th, 2016 | 12 comments - (comments are closed) older entries » who are we?
