wpbakery page builder plugin. after you activate the required plugin, the elements should be available for use in wpbakery page builder shortcode section. reviews flawed, but earnest effort atomicnicholas april 15, 2019 this did not work on my installation. it froze on the semitransparent white screen while loading wpbakery's page builder (while their logo was on and it was loading). i reckon it must be a conflict with another plugin. what's more, this plugin has excessive menu elements/tabs added to the dashboard (clients, etc.), at least 3 of them (extensive vc settings, etc.), polluting the dashboard menu when it could organize it easily with a submenu under one menu item or even under settings tab. i personally really hate plugins that pollute the dashboard unnecessarily. normally just one of those would warrant a 1-star. in this case there are two. however, i will still give this 4 stars because of the earnest effort. these seem like good featuers. and for providing what seem like great features to users for free. so please do address the issues above, and another time i'll check if it will finally be compatible with my install without conflicts. very good
