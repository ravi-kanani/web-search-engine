i love your blog!! also, are all the meals that you make your own dinners, lunches etc. or do you cook just to take photos and not eat the food? reply steph says: may 22, 2014 at 10:44 am hi hannah, i’m not too sure how i got a following – in my eyes, i’m still a baby blog next to the giants of the food blog world. the followers did not come right away at all. and a big yes to eating all of the food that’s on the blog. i cannot fathom taking photos of the food and not eating it. that goes against every fibre of my food loving being. :) reply polly crowninshield says: june 4, 2014 at 3:37 pm how do i subscribe to this wonderful blog? i don’t do instagram, facebook, pinterest etc…just email. reply steph says: june 15, 2014 at 9:37 am hi polly, i’m working on setting up an email subscription – i’ll keep you updated! reply tanya duckworth says: july 30, 2014 at 2:54 pm me too please! reply marti says: june 4, 2014 at 9:21 pm congratulations on your saveur editor’s choice award, stephanie! reply steph says: june 15, 2014 at 9:39 am thank you, thank you marti!! xoxo reply chris j says: june 5, 2014 at 8:42 pm you have gorgeous hair. reply ray gozun says: june 17, 2014 at 8:40 am congratulations on your saveur award. i subscribe to the magazine and it’s how i was introduced to your endeavor. i don’t normally read blogs, but your site is quite magnetic. i like the simple recipes and the truly mouth-watering photos. i have 2 questions, if you don’t mind. 1. what is your heritage/ancestry? 2. i live in seattle and visit my sister in vancouver every now and then. are there any restaurants you recommend? regards and continued success to you. ray reply steph says: june 22, 2014 at 6:07 pm 1. i’m chinese. 2. ooh, there are so many places i love in vancouver. i’ve been meaning to put up a post – i’ll do it soon! reply evan krefsky says: june 18, 2014 at 11:17 am love the blog. how can i get it emailed to me?

because to be honest i don’t really know what i’m doing haha, and also, how do you make the stamp things that you put on your photos? they’re so cool! reply steph says: july 11, 2014 at 12:10 pm hi jaz! ooh, i could write a whole blog with tips on running a blog. but to be honest, i’m no expert :) i say just do what you love. there are a ton of great blogging resources out there, much more eloquent than anything i could say. as for the stamps i create vector illustrations in illustrator and then apply them in photoshop. hope that helps! reply fred says: july 9, 2014 at 5:06 am hi, i’m 17 and thinking of setting up a food blog for students. i was just wandering what blogging website you used to set yourself up and what methods you initially undertook in order to gain an audience?? love the look of the blog!! reply steph says: july 11, 2014 at 12:11 pm hi fred, my site is a wordpress site with a custom theme. reply kerwin says: july 9, 2014 at 6:50 am do you have any favorite food blogs that you look at once in awhile?

this really bugs me. grrrr. reply steph says: september 16, 2014 at 10:32 am hi vivian, the giveaways are sponsored by american companies and i have to comply with their giveaway rules. canadian companies don’t seem to have the budget/interest for giveaways. it’s too bad, i’d love to do canadian giveaways. reply christen says: september 17, 2014 at 4:53 am just found your blog thru a local food magazine here in the philippines:) can you do a post on kitchen’s must haves?

delicious regards! hamed reply stephanie le says: february 8, 2016 at 10:21 am hi hamed, thank you for asking but i don’t allow my photos to be used anywhere on the internet other than on my own website. please refrain from using them. reply mandisa says: february 18, 2016 at 6:12 pm hi stephanie. what would you say was a turning point for you from a photography standpoint?

reply stephanie le says: march 13, 2016 at 10:45 am hey megan, my snapchat is @iamafoodblog :) reply shahanara says: april 1, 2016 at 2:37 am hi from the uk steph! :) i stumbled across your blog after finding your ‘what to eat in tokyo’ post on pinterest (great post by the way!). i’ve really been enjoying reading the rest of your blog. i know you focus mainly on the subject of food in your posts, but i’m going to do the unfathomable now and ask you a non-food related question: please could give me a little information about the time you moved to tokyo and how you settled in over there? moving to japan is something that’s been on my mind lately, but i’m not sure where to start… p.s. is there an easier way for me to read your posts and click on a tab to go onto the next post without having to go back to the main homepage? reply kimberley says: june 26, 2016 at 9:55 am hi there! i love your blog. i’m new to blogging and i’m curious as to which recipe plugin you use? i’ve just been typing mine in the body of the post (i know, rookie mistake) but i want it to be easy to print, like yours are. thanks and keep making cute stuff! :) reply stephanie le says: june 26, 2016 at 10:30 am hey kimberley, i don’t use a plugin – my husband, mike codes it so that i just type it into the body of the post and then do markup on it using wordpress. sorry if that wasn’t too helpful! reply sonia says: july 12, 2016 at 10:50 am hi steph and mike! i randomly came across your food blog and it is quite awesome! i am fascinated by your adorable dessert recipes! all the animal doughnuts and cakes are so adorable! i hope that you guys post more dessert recipes in the future (please do) i am wondering where you guys got the cute molds for the animals like in the bunny carrot cupcake loaf recipe or the lemon shortbread recipe. thank you and please continue the amazing work! -sonia reply stephanie le says: july 12, 2016 at 2:39 pm hi sonia, it’s a miffy cookie cutter – i got it in japan, but they sell it on amazon too, here’s the link: http://amzn.to/29zpf6q -steph reply janet says: august 14, 2016 at 12:10 pm hello! i was wondering how you resize your images in post for your blog to retain the max quality? exporting to a smaller pixel size (like 700 pixel width) often turns my photos blurry, and i feel like i’m missing something. your photos seem razor sharp whether they’re thumbnails or screen-wide. thanks so much in advance! reply stephanie le says: august 15, 2016 at 11:10 am mike make a custom theme that allows me to upload photos at 2x resolution. that’s why they look sharp on your screen. hope that helps! reply deborah lyons jacobs says: august 25, 2016 at 7:45 am please add me so i receive email blogs from you thank you deb reply cecilia says: september 6, 2016 at 4:53 am i love your blog! ♡ and your photos are very interesting, appetising and attractive…congrats to both! reply bettina says: september 10, 2016 at 10:18 pm hi, i`m uruguaian cook. i`ve been reading some recipes in differents webs and one of them is yours. this is the way that i`ve discovered your blog. could you tell me if your american o britain blog? i like it a lot. regards. reply fb says: march 12, 2017 at 4:25 am love your blog! please keep me updated with all your adventures by email! reply hope hill says: march 18, 2017 at 3:56 pm live your blog but could not find where to subscribe to your email newsletter. can you please sign me up? reply upperspoon says: february 12, 2018 at 3:44 pm your photography is just beautiful, i was simply shocked to hear that you do it all with a speed light, very impressive. i would like to learn to use one over constant lighting one day. if you ever post an article about lighting please be sure to let me know. reply sassygirl says: april 14, 2019 at 5:06 am would love to subscribe! reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website subscribe to our newsletter and never miss another post! follow @iamafoodblog about | faq | new here?
