how to get hair that looks naturally curly may 9, 2019 by hair romance 3 comments do you wish you had curly hair? here‚Äôs a tutorial to show you how to style your hair so that it looks naturally curly. but don‚Äôt you already have curly hair? yes, i know this seems like a strange tutorial for me to do as i already have wavy/curly hair but the grass is always greener, so if you‚Äôre wondering what you‚Äôd look like with curly hair, i hope this might help you. i‚Äôm pretty sure i‚Äôm going to get some comments from people with naturally curly hair that this is a terrible idea and why am i doing this tutorial but this is for everyone out there who really want to have curly hair. or if you‚Äôre like me, and want to style your curly hair perfectly so that it looks ‚Äúnatural‚Äù then you can follow the same steps. you see this tutorial was really me getting ready for a night out at the australian hair fashion awards (ahfas) and i wanted to avoid washing out any of my pink hair colour. how to get hair that looks naturally curly ‚Äì get ready with me for the ahfas click here if you can‚Äôt see the video above styling tools for this tutorial you really do need specific hair styling tools. i‚Äôve two different curling wands though you could do it with just one wand. the curling wands i used are: muk curl stick with the 9-19mm barrel h2d x3 curling wand ‚Äì 19mm barrel most standard curling wands are around 20-30mm so the smaller the wand, the tighter your curls will be. also note that your hair will drop and soften over time so it‚Äôs best to style your hair a little tighter than you want so it looks good all night. hair products if you have straight hair you‚Äôll definitely need to prep your hair to make sure that your curls last the distance. i recommend using a volumising mousse to add some grip and texture to your hair and then just to roughly blowdry your hair before you begin. this helps to activate the mousse into your hair and add a little bit more texture so that the curls will last. i recommend: extra care keratin styling mousse living proof thickening mousse heat protectants as always when using high heat tools, i recommend using a heat protectant spray. if you‚Äôre starting with wet hair and using a mousse, check if that is also a heat protectant or i recommend: batiste heat & shine spray joico thermal spray finishing products for extra volume i love hair powders and this time i used the marc anthony dream big volume volumizing super powder. check out my tips for using styling powders here. to smooth down the surface frizz, i love o&m frizzy logic which you can find here in australia and here in the usa. styling tips: change directions the key to naturally looking curls is to alternate which way you‚Äôre curling your hair around the wand. normally in curling tutorials, you only curl your hair away from the face. when styling tight curls they can tend to clump together and they won‚Äôt look as natural. natural hair is a little bit more messy and they curls should sit apart from each other. switch up the size of your curls i‚Äôve used two curling wands to help give the look of more natural curls. it‚Äôs really normal to have a mix of different curl sizes in any naturally curly hair and so by mixing up tight curls with a few layers of wider curls it gives a more natural finish. let it cool to make sure that your curls really set in, let them cool before you touch them. i use this time to get my make-up done and then finish the hair just before going out. pump up the volume i‚Äôve used a hair powder to add some texture and volume as i‚Äôm messing up the curls. the thing i love about a hair powder is its a little bit matte and it really works to add volume right at the roots as well. it definitely gives the curls much more of a lift and natural look and stops it looking too exact and perfect which they can be from a curling wand. know when to stop when you‚Äôre shaking out those curls, it‚Äôs really difficult to know if you‚Äôve gone far enough or you haven‚Äôt quite got there yet. you run the risk when you play with the hairstyle too much that you‚Äôll undo a lot of your curls. so be gentle and remember to take a step back and examine how they are looking at all angles. have fun with your new curls the best thing about me wearing this style is everybody though it was my natural hair!
