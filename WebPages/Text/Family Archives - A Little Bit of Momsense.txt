here are some activities that you may want to check out (i’ve included ones that will be perfect for older kids and ones for younger toddlers and preschoolers too!) what to do in #ottawa with the kids in august via @bitofmomsense click to tweet fun family activities to do in ottawa this august explore the canadian history hall the history hall has been something we’ve been looking forward to, and it’s on our august list to visit. with so many canadian artifacts and so much information in one spot, it’s sure to be an interesting visit. learn about vimy at the canadian war museum my son has been asking to go to this for a while, so if you have older kids or ones interested in military history, the limited vimy – beyond the battle exhibit (it’s here until november) will be of interest to you. this is also on our august list! take in the fun programming at billings estate national historic site this was brought to my attention by my sister who has three little ones under the age of five. she raved about the special programming at the billings estate national estate site (a place we love to go too!). i didn’t realize they had so much to offer during the summer. there are programs for preschools as well as kids up to age 12. different days of the week offer a different theme. check it out! learn about farming at the cumberland heritage village museum another local museum that we love is the cumberland museum. on august 13, they have a special farming event where families can learn more about farm life, and get hands-on with experiments and more. go back in time at upper canada village we love visiting upper canada village, and the summer is always a great time to walk around the village and explore. plus, buy bread. before you go: print off the two free children’s tickets that ontario has available! visit petrie island i recently wrote an article on savvymom about all the fun activities at petrie island. it’s been a rough year for the island, and some activities may have changed depending on how the location is doing, but it’s worth looking into the junior naturalists program so kids can learn more about the creatures and plants living there! walk through mosaicanada i keep talking about this event, but it’s for good reason. if you haven’t been, it’s worth checking out. it’s free and stunning. attend the navan fair i love a rural fair. probably because i grew up where every summer you couldn’t wait to attend the fair. i also love deep fried mini donuts. the navan fair is august 10-13! check out the ottawa busker festival i always find it fun when we are able to see art, acting, music and more on the streets, up close and out in the open. the ottawa busker fest is sure to have the kids in awe as they watch! it’s on sparks street from august 3-7! happy august! rebecca 1 min read july 31, 2011 6 replies on the farm activities and crafts, around ottawa, parenting a favourite place of ours to visit with the kids is the agriculture museum right here in ottawa. since i grew up on a farm (my grandfather was a farmer and we had a barn that he used beside his large one) i feel a special connection to it. having a farm for my children to visit (now that my grandfather doesn’t anymore) is especially important for me. i want them to see the hard work involved, how animals are raised, where milk and other foods come from and feel connected to all of that, as i did growing up. the agriculture museum, or ‘farm’ or ‘to see king’ as it’s called in our house (king is a clysdale horse who lives there) is a frequent request. i started going when my son was less than a year. it was a perfect outing for the two of us during the day and we’d bring snacks as they got older and picnic. now it remains a family favourite. there are animals, tractors on display, special exhibitions and a play park. what’s not to love? we buy the family membership each year and it’s well worth it (not to mention that our membership also gets us into the aviation museum and museum of science and technology) coming up at the farm: an ice cream festival on august 7. have you been to the agriculture museum? rebecca 2 min read july 25, 2011 2 replies leaving and coming home kids, parenting it has been on very rare occasions that i’ve been away for extended periods of time from my children. a few hours here and there when my son was little; a few nights i was away from him when i gave birth to his sister. i’ve spent the night away from them twice, and in total was away about 24 hours only. and, they were left with their father so still one of us was with them. when andy was sick we were gone longer days at a time and those days were focused on andy’s health, then we’d get home to children who obviously had a great time with the family staying with them, but still missed us greatly and felt what a stressful time it was. not to be away from them any longer than we need to be has always been about choice and while i love date nights, and projects that get me out of the house once and a while, i enjoy staying at home with my family and haven’t felt very ready to extend those times away. (and i should note, each time i’ve been away, they have done perfectly well, of course.) this weekend was the social capital conference and i was a part of the planning committee. we worked very hard to come to this one day so i knew i would be gone all day. when i told my son i was going to a meeting all day he exclaimed “will you come home!!? will you be gone forever?!” time doesn’t mean much to children. i always came home i told him and that he’d have a great day. i left at 6 am but came home rather early at 7 pm. i was beyond tired. the kids were already sleeping. so when my daughter stirred around 8 pm looking for me i was more than happy to go in and snuggle her back to sleep. upon seeing me she declared “mommy! you came back home!” this has been her new thing lately. i could be gone for a 60 minute hair cut and when i return home she is very happy but almost surprised. but after a long day away from the kids, and feeling overtired and emotional, her bedtime declaration that she was so happy i came home, couldn’t make me help but think: i don’t ever want to leave again. snuggle your kiddos. we can’t stop life from happening and being away from them is inevitable, but we can make sure to enjoy the times we are with them. facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube grab a coffee and join me! welcome to a little bit of momsense! my name is rebecca and i'm chatting about parenting, family friendly activities, yummy recipes, family travel, and living a life full of love and laughter. thanks for stopping by! fabulous advertisers, friends and affiliates for content tips and support – subscribe! use code momsense10 to save 20% this error message is only visible to wordpress admins error: the account for needs to be reconnected. due to recent instagram platform changes this instagram account needs to be reconnected in order to continue updating. reconnect on plugin settings page visit rebecca's profile on pinterest. tags activities activities with kids activity around ottawa baseball birthdays blogging centrepointe theatres children christmas disney junior family family activities family time family travel food gift guide giveaway halloween holidays home kids kraft canada learning march break mothers day netflix ottawa ottawa events parenting pei pinterest play preschool activity recipe recipes school shopping sobeys summer tag along toys terra20 thanksgiving theatre travel archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 missed a post? making a greener difference with these easy changes (plus enter to win!) activity: make and design a hotel! activities for kids: subjective art a fun scavenger hunt game for the kids (with printable!) playing with cardboard – don’t recycle those boxes yet! get-moving activity: movement stations for kids 8 carry-on items to travel with: what i bring to travel family travel: hotel tips for travelling with children walt disney world planning tips: family travel ottawa giveaway: enter to win 4 tickets at meridian theatres facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube we use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website for personalization, advertising and to analyze usage. by using this site, you agree to this.continuewant more info? read our privacy policy.
