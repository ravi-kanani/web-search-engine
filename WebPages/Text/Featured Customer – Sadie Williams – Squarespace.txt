i’m sadie williams and i’m a fashion designer. how did you first become interested in being a fashion designer? i have always loved clothes and dressing up, and i think it can be one of the most fun parts of the day. i decided to do fashion after having an "anti-fashion" moment when i was about nineteen. i wanted to do art and print design and then actually thought, “no, i really do want to do fashion—it’s always been there with me.” you style is so unique. do you feel like not fitting in has been a good thing for your career? i definitely think you should always stay true to yourself. i think growing up and going to portobello market and buying vintage clothes and second-hand clothes when i was really young, and also going to a funny boarding school in a safe environment where i could dress up and wear whatever i wanted, has definitely influenced my style. i’ve always kind of worn what i wanted. what do you like about the freedom of being your own boss and not answering to anyone? i like that i can pursue my vision and be in touch with myself creatively, and gather a big team of people around me to help make it happen. what has inspired you? i don’t like to pigeonhole inspiration to one area. i find inspiration in all sorts of places like exhibitions, photography books, flea markets, boot sales, ebay shopping. “i have a website to showcase my work and get my vision across. i want people to understand my brand identity and how i use colors, textures, and fabrics.” sadie williams what’s something that’s difficult about your career that we might not know about, not being in fashion? i think it’s most difficult having more than one role. i’m never just a fashion designer. i run the studio, partner with factories, and manage my website, all sorts of things. how do you create your unique style? i’ve always been quite eclectic in how i pick up my inspiration, so it’s always down to the edit, what you use and what you take away. i’ve always been drawn to putting an odd combination of things together. why do you have a website? i have a website to showcase my work and get my vision across. i want people to understand my brand identity and how i use colors, textures, and fabrics. i can just update it whenever i have a new season collection or news. “i like that i can pursue my vision and be in touch with myself creatively, and gather a big team of people around me to help make it happen.” sadie williams watch our "make it stand out" ad featuring sadie williams. sadie shares her vision with the world using squarespace. bring your ideas to life. get started read more stories see hiraeth's story fashion designers hiraeth see keanu's story actor & co-founder of arch motorcycle keanu reeves see adrienne's story photographer and art director adrienne raquel see daniel’s story artist daniel arsham see sadie's story fashion designer sadie williams see danny's story chef & co-founder of mission chinese food danny bowien see fran's story writer, activist, and podcast host fran tirado see yi-mei's story fashion business owner yi-mei truxes see john's story actor & fashion designer john malkovich see tom's story interior designer tom delavan see craig's story graphic designer craig ward see oscar the grouch's story artist oscar the grouch squarespace logo squarespace logo ↓ ↓ products ↓ website templates websites domains online stores point of sale extensions marketing tools email marketing scheduling stories professional email logo maker premium plan pricing feature list customers ↓ featured small businesses photographers bloggers artists restaurants musicians weddings students company ↓ about careers our brand press & media newsroom terms of service privacy policy contact us timeline imprint community ↓ help & support hire an expert forum webinars developer platform circle follow ↓ newsroom squarespace blog creative blog engineering blog service status instagram youtube linkedin facebook twitter
