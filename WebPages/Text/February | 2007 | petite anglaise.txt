petite anglaise february 23, 2007 holiday filed under: parting ways — petiteanglaiseparis @ 2:02 pm “are you sure it won’t be too weird, me meeting you and your friends for dinner in marrakech?” i say, between forkfuls of crispy pancake. mr frog and i are having lunch at the vietnamese restaurant tucked behind the café chéri(e) on boulevard de la villette. tiny and unassuming, it is nonetheless jam packed, and we were lucky to get a table at all. “it will be slightly awkward, yes,” he replies with a half smile, “but we can’t not meet up. it’s too much of a coincidence that we’ve ended up both being there at the same time…” “well, i’m pleased you feel that way,” i say. “i’m quite nervous about being on holiday on my own, so it’s nice to know i’ll have some chaperones on my first night, at least.” when i booked my holiday, you see, to neatly coincide with tadpole’s stay with her french grandparents during half term, i knew mr frog was going to casablanca, but neither of us had any inkling that a weekend in marrakech was also on the cards. if he was going alone, meeting wouldn’t be odd in the slightest. we often do lunch, with or without tadpole, or shoot the breeze by email or googlechat. but since our breakup nearly two years ago i’ve barely clapped eyes on any of his friends or work colleagues. they were more his than mine, and i figured i’d relinquished my right to see them. not that they hate me or anything, and i’m almost certain that mr frog badmouthed me to no-one, because that’s simply not his style. but seeing these people after almost two years, after everything that has happened, both in public and in private, it’s bound to be strange. i try to imagine the conversation we’ll have over pastilla and tajine in a rooftop restaurant overlooking the medina. “so, catherine, you’re writing a book now. what’s it about? it’s a memoir, right?” i blush. “well, er, meeting this guy for starters.” i point at mr frog with my fork. “and then, er, leaving him for someone else, and how we all dealt with that. among other things.” oh yes, i feel sure this is definitely going to be weird. comments (78) a good cause filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 1:29 pm dear pa, in the uk we often take the right to blog for granted. but what if a post on petite anglaise landed you in prison? in china, internet sites are blocked, chat rooms are monitored and journalists and bloggers are arrested. amnesty international is deeply worried about the restriction of the right to freedom of expression in china. right now we’re appealing for the release of shi tao, a journalist arrested in 2004 and sentenced to 10 years in prison for sending an email to a pro-democracy website in the us about press restrictions around the anniversary of the crackdown on peaceful protests in tiananmen square in 1989. you can do something now to help: you can do something now to help. we are asking for you and your readers to write to the chinese authorities demanding the release of shi tao, as part of our irrepressible.info campaign against internet repression. see here for more details. to show your support for freedom of expression on the internet add this link to your blog and help amnesty international find more people to stand up for human rights. thank you for your help, drew davies (amnesty international) comments off on a good cause february 21, 2007 one filed under: navel gazing, single life — petiteanglaiseparis @ 7:57 pm as i sat on the métro on the way to see some girlfriends yesterday, a bag containing chablis, nutella and maple syrup wedged between my feet, i couldn’t help thinking back to happier versions of mardi gras, and in particular the 2006 edition, in honour of which i threw a pancake party and invited a few friends* from work to my old apartment. it was the first and last time many of them got to meet the man i referred to on this blog as lover (a pseudonym to which a few readers strongly objected, but i felt then, as i do now, that given just how much time we spent horizontal, the name fit very snugly indeed). a few days later lover brought my dreams of an idyllic life together in the breton countryside crashing down around my ears. i picked myself up, carried on, and so much other stuff happened shortly afterwards that i really didn’t know how to feel anything other than numb for a while. what this means is that i’ve now been single for almost a full calendar year. it’s a state of affairs without precedent, because after much racking of brains and counting of digits, i can say with absolute certainty that the last time i was single for a whole year was in 1988. although to be fair, at that time i’d been single for a total of fifteen years and was breathlessly awaiting the arrival of my first proper boyfriend. how do i feel about this? well, of course i’d rather be happily alone than with someone who was wrong for me. and yes, messing around with few strings attached seemed like fun for a while, but now just strikes me as utterly pointless. as for online dating, i check in to look at my profile from time to time but can rarely muster up sufficient enthusiasm to actually reply to my emails, let alone drag myself out on a blind date. i know that this year without a special (adult) person by my side has been really good for me, in some ways. i’ve built new friendships, invested a lot more in existing ones and spent lashings of quality time with my daughter. i’m sure i needed to be alone, for a while, and that i’ll appreciate sharing the good, the bad and the ugly with a special someone all the more because of it, when the time comes. but am i truly happy with this state of affairs? is single the best thing since the invention of nutella? is single the new size zero? i’d be lying if i said i loved it. single still doesn’t come naturally to me and i doubt it ever will. so please excuse me while i go and comfort myself with a large pot of leftover nutella, a useful side effect of which is that size zero will never, never fit. comments (65) february 19, 2007 wrong-footed filed under: working girl — petiteanglaiseparis @ 11:00 am i am going to the prud’hommes (french industrial tribunal thingy) today to contest my dismissal. this is rather unexpected, but my lawyer informed me late on friday evening that contrary to everything we had been led to believe, my ex-employer’s lawyers had changed their minds about asking for the hearing to be deferred to a later date (and had forgotten to let us know). given that i’d been told precisely the opposite a matter of days earlier, it’s somewhat miraculous that i’m back from the uk, have childcare for the day and can attend at all. i suppose, to look on the bright side, at least i haven’t spent the last week feeling apprehensive, which might have put a dampener on my trip to england with tadpole. more later… update: lawyer obtained a deferral and the case now will be heard on 21 march, which should give me time to actually read the substance of the arguments being made against me and make sure all the facts are straight. comments (85) older posts » search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com. post to cancel
