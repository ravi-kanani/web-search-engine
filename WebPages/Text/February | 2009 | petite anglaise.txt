petite anglaise february 5, 2009 package filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 4:49 pm at the risk of upsetting those of my readers who find self-promotion irritating, i just wanted to share with you the contents of the package that arrived this afternoon. it occurs to me that tadople may be a little vexed when she comes home from school and realises she is no longer a cover ‘star’ but, all in all, i’m very pleased with the book in its newest incarnation. so, um, paperback petite should now be widely available in uk bookshops and supermarkets for as little as £4.00 (that’s the current going rate on amazon, via the link to the right). the eagle-eyed among you will also note that there’s a trip to paris on eurostar up for grabs via a competition lurking within. as of next week i shall be absconding to belize with the boy on my honeymoon in a bid to avoid teh internets in general (and amazon rankings, in particular). i’ll be back to wow you with blurry photos of underwater fauna at the beginning of march. comments off on package february 4, 2009 fickle filed under: tadpole rearing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 10:57 am it’s almost bedtime and having just popped a decidedly honeymoon bikini-unfriendly gratin into the oven, i’m putting my feet up for a moment. tadpole pads out of the bathroom wearing a towel, her hair gathered up into a curly knot on top of her head. for the past two months, the next part of our evening routine consisted of tadpole lying on the sofa while i rasped away at the sole of her right foot with an emery board, applied an acid preparation and covered my handiwork in adhesive dressings. but, thankfully, the verruca cluster on her right heel is history now. so when tadpole slides her bottom onto the sofa by my side, we can devote the last few minutes of her day to more pleasant activities, like reading stories together or just shooting the breeze. ‘how many sleeps is it until theatre class?’ says tadpole innocently. ‘is it two more, or is it three?’ ‘three,’ i reply, darting her an amused look. ‘why do you ask? are you looking forward to getting leonardo all to yourself?’ tadpole blushes. leonardo is her playground crush. jules, her amoureux of the first two years of maternelle had the misfortune to be allocated to a different class when they both moved up to the grande section in september. he’s only just a along the corridor nowadays, but this minor geographical shift has made a world of difference. i fully understand, never having been much good at long-distance relationships myself. loin des yeux, loin du coeur as they say. leonardo, on the other hand, is not only in tadpole’s class but also attends her friday evening éveil théâtral activity, at a nearby centre d’animation. there they slither along the floor pretending to be snakes, stand immobile side by side with their arms stretched to the ceiling being trees and, according to the teacher, are pretty much joined at the hip. ‘last time at theatre class,’ tadpole confides, ‘leonardo did give me a kiss on the cheek. he said that i have extremely very soft skin and he told me that i’m pretty when i take off my glasses…’ she frowns. ‘but mummy,’ she adds, ‘when we’re at school, he says he loves suzanne most of all. and in the cour de recréation today, he did hold her hand.’ ‘but what about nina?’ i say, puzzled. ‘i thought nina was his school girlfriend, and you were his theatre class girlfriend.’ it is to be hoped that my apparent acceptance of this unusual situation is not paving the way for tadpole to willingly participate in a ménage-à-trois when she is older. tadpole shakes her head. ‘he changed his mind about nina,’ she explains. ‘because she chose raphaël to be her king when we ate the galette des rois.’ i am reminded of when we cut into our own galette at home, just after the new year. by devious means, i made sure tadpole ate the slice containing the fève. when the time came to choose her king, however, she protested that she didn’t have a real choice, the boy being the only male present and startled us all by choosing one of her soft toy frogs instead. the irony of this – although tadpole has no idea i call her father mr frog on this blog – was not entirely lost on me. ‘well,’ i say to tadpole, casting around for something wise-sounding to say. ‘if leonardo doesn’t appreciate you all the time, it’s his loss. one day, when you are much older, you’ll have a real boyfriend. someone who only wants to hold your hand.’ ‘but mummy,’ tadpole protests. ‘i am grown up. i’m five years old! and leonardo is real.’ oh, he’s real alright, i think to myself. and he’s well on his way to becoming a real player. comments (41) search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
