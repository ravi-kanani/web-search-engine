18feb 202018 feb 2020 add a comment unfortunately, i am not sure i like all the news i heard about the dark eye (tde): book of heroes. i am basing my information on two videos, one from orkenspalter tv (a big and popular german tde fansite project) from january 23, and a second one from a german gaming magazine gameswelt from january 24. the latter reports that the game will cost 40 € and will feature about 20 hours of gameplay. however, orkenspalter tv says that it won’t be a “full-price title” and that the game’s price hasn’t been set yet. so maybe it won’t be 40 € after all. a note about the videos: i only found german ones, but the videos show the game sequences in english. so, while you may not understand anything they say, you can take a look at the game, at least. let’s first take a look at what you can do in the game. most information comes from the orkenspalter video. you start by creating your character, just as you would expect in a roleplaying game. fortunately, we get a good amount of choices here! in the pen and paper game, i recently started trying out a blessed one of phex and i’m happy to see this choice available here as well! there are four species to choose from: human, elf, half-elf and dwarf. then you choose the class: scoundrel, warrior, guild mage and blessed one. each of these have three subclasses, so we get a total of 12 classes. i’m going to give some examples for the three blessed one classes to show you the diversity here: phex is the god of thievery and trade. blessed ones of phex (in the pen and paper version of the game) can be specialized in either or in both of these aspects. the one i made for my pen and paper group is mostly focusing on trade (and earning a profit, of course!), but she isn’t averse to… well, let’s say taking advantage of situations when there are rich people showing a certain neglect of regular safety protocols. never would she steal from the poor, though. and it has to be a challenge. if somebody left their wallet wide open and left it somewhere – how much of a challenge would that be? she would insult phex if she took that money! i assume the skills of the blessed one of phex in book of heroes will reflect the blessed ones in the pen and paper universe at least to a certain extent. the second one you can create is a blessed one of boron. boron is the god of death and dreams. the blessed ones often care for the deceased. undeads are against everything they stand and pray for! boron is the god of dead, not undead, after all. their goal would be to make sure they stay dead as boron would want them to. also, some blessed ones specialize in handling patients with mental disorders. the third one is a blessed one of rondra. rondra is the godess of combat. these blessed ones are focusing on exactly that. if i remember correctly (never had much to do with that godess as my characters were closer to boron, phex or others), all fights have to be honorable. rondra loathes cowardice and deceitfulness, though. you can probably imagine the differences between such a character and a blessed one of phex… after choosing your subclass, you choose your character’s origin, a “twist of fate” (whatever that is), something dark in the background (also no idea what that is) and a personal mission which sent you on the adventure in the first place. the story will take place in the middenrealms, so only in one part of aventuria. there will not be an epic overarching story leading you through the dungeons, but your personal mission will work as a lighter common theme, apparently. once your character is created, you will find about 20 missions to play through. you can replay these missions as the dungeons themselves will be randomly generated when you start them. mháire (from orkenspalter tv) played the tutorial and two missions and she states in the video that she saw some rooms over and over again (the version she played isn’t the final game yet, so this may change…). the background story can appear in one of these missions or not as it’s apparently also random where you’ll meet your story’s objectives. mháire points out that it’s more a bonus to doing the missions and not a big overarching background story, so don’t expect too much here! you work your way through these randomly generated dungeons with three other players/npc companions. within the dungeons, you’ll mostly have to kill npcs. some fights can be avoided by talking to npcs trying to persuade them to give you what you want. there are also a few riddles, but they’re apparently not complex at all. for example, place a statue on a certain platform to keep a door open. this reminded me of guild wars where you had a few missions like that as well. i always hated them. especially the one where a ghost kept running to place the statue back where it belonged. but they did add some diversity. anyway, the dungeons also change somewhat depending on which characters you have with you. now this is something that i like! i want the environment to react differently to an elf or dwarf given that in some parts of the world the civilians may have never seen either of them before or they have prejudices against them. in between missions, you’re in an inn where you can trade for items, sell stuff and also advance your character’s skills. advancing your character is much easier and not as complex as it is in the dark eye (version 5). this may be good or bad depending on whether you like having a complex system here. there’s also some crafting in the game for potions and items. gameswelt basically calls it a “roleplay game for in between”. the game will not let you freely explore the open world. we already knew that much. instead, you click on the map to start individual dungeons. each dungeon will take about 30 minutes up to an hour to complete. in general, i like what i’m hearing. don’t get me wrong, i would definitely prefer an open-world game for tde. but i think having a game where i hop from dungeon to dungeon and can do so in smallish amounts of time sounds really nice! an enjoyable thing to do to relax after a day of work. the graphics are nice enough. i don’t need any super modern and complex graphics to be happy as long as it fits somehow. and in this case, i think it does. at the end of the gameswelt video, we learn that there are three graphics sets (dungeon, ruins and forest) and whenever you enter a dungeon, it will be randomly generated from that. the speaker says that it can get old pretty quickly. this fits to mháire saying she saw the same room several times. the developers are currently working on balancing, optimizing the loot you find in the dungeons and on implementing their own voice chat. a regular written chat is there already, but it’s not fast enough for cooperative combat. they also want to improve the single player part, but didn’t go into detail what it contains. the game is started to be released in the 2nd quarter of this year – so anywhere between april to june. overall, it sounds like a neat little game more or less loosely based on the dark eye universe. that is, the characters come from the universe, but how much of the story is relevant for the dark eye (and couldn’t take place in any other generic fantasy world), we’ll have to see. for the record: i do not want or need a huge epic story! but i very much want something that is relevant to aventuria and not generic. i think the price (if they plan on selling it for 40 €) is pretty ambitious given the low amount of hours of gametime they suggest. at least, since it’s a roleplaying game, i think 20 hours doesn’t sound like much. there is also the question of replay value! because when you create your character, you get 20 missions with each taking 30 to 60 hours. but if the game is so much fun that you really want to explore all the classes, then you may personally get a lot more hours of gametime. still, for me personally, the game itself seems too shallow in some parts – mostly when they talk about seeing the same room design over and over again – which in itself wouldn’t be too bad. but since they’re (possibly) asking for 40 €, i think it’s too much. i don’t think i’ll buy it for 40 € and in this case, will rather wait for reviews first and for the game to go on a sale. if it is 20 €, then i would – definitely still wait for a few reviews but get it for its full price if the reviews are good. for 30 €, the reviews would have to be very good for me to consider buying it. and most importantly, the missions should not be generic! i want to experience aventuria! but so far, we still have to wait and see… and until then, i’m closing this blog post with the latest gameplay trailer they released (in english!): share this: click to share on twitter (opens in new window) click to share on facebook (opens in new window) click to email this to a friend (opens in new window) click to share on whatsapp (opens in new window) click to share on pocket (opens in new window) more click to share on telegram (opens in new window) click to share on linkedin (opens in new window) click to print (opens in new window) click to share on reddit (opens in new window) click to share on pinterest (opens in new window) click to share on skype (opens in new window) click to share on tumblr (opens in new window) like this: like loading... related categories: games indie developer roleplaying game published by paeroka view all posts by paeroka tags: aventuria, book of heroes, das schwarze auge, indie developer, roleplaying game, the dark eye, the dark eye: book of heroes post navigation previous first impressions: overcrowd: a commute ‘em up next guild wars 2: third expansion coming!
