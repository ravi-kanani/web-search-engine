inevitably, the kids will all have a favourite and it will be the same one – probably the throne in our en suite. but at least there are two emergency bogs to run to. having different things to worry about they say that moving home is one of the most stressful things in life and i can confirm this to be the case. but it has also served a purpose – you see, i’ve long since accepted that i always need to have something to fret about. and, frankly, this has become a bit stale as a concern. it’s had a fantastic run, but it’s time to be consumed by apprehension about other things. gum disease is a strong candidate for my new chief worry. calmer bedtimes it’s going to take time for everyone to settle but bedtimes will eventually get easier. the kids will have a room each so that will reduce the shenanigans significantly. we’ll then turn our attention to persuading them that they don’t actually have an unquenchable thirst. if i work out how i’ll share the details here. more privacy we don’t drive so living 20 yards from a bus stop for the last decade has been really handy. but i won’t miss it. traffic often backs up so we’re used to people gawping through our windows from double-decker buses. this is especially awkward post-shower. our new gaff backs onto nothing but fields, so it’s going to be nice to only be spied on by badgers and hedgehogs. being slightly less dopey i’ve been so distracted by the business end of our move that i’ve done some pretty stupid things lately. like nearly losing my nose to a combination of storm dennis and our top-opening tool store. i followed this by dropping the head of my beard trimmer down the toilet. maybe moving to a house with three of them isn’t such a good idea after all… moving home 1 previous post next post related posts family life looking for the silver linings in worrying times family life i’ve taken myself for a mug family life goodbye old house, hello new home comments pingback: goodbye old house, hello new home | family life | diary of the dad leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. comment name email website this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed. about me i'm tom briggs. a proud dad of three and, somehow or other, the writer of a multi-award-winning dad blog. i've been writing diary of the dad since 2010 and it's gone from a small hobby to my full-time job. i still have the same enthusiasm for this blog as i did when i wrote my first post and hope you enjoy reading my musings as much as i do writing them. if you're a journalist looking for a dad's point of view, you may want to check my as seen in page. similarly, if you're a pr or brand, please visit my work with me page. finally, if you want to get in touch with me, my email address is: tom@diaryofthedad.co.uk follow me as seen in recent posts looking for the silver linings in worrying times i’ve taken myself for a mug goodbye old house, hello new home five things i’m looking forward to about moving house ah well, never mind search for: awards and rankings archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 categories categories select category 40 before 40 baby and toddler blogging books budgeting charity christmas comment days out education family life fashion father’s day films food and drink football health and fitness home and garden lifestyle mother’s day motoring nine to five parenting pregnancy sleep special occasions tech toys and games travel tv uncategorized video games work theme by scissor themes proudly powered by wordpress
