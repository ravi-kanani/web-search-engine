photographers describe their best shot, including rihanna getting mobbed in paris and a big yawn during a train ride through the alps. “i love how the yawning man contrasts with the majesty of the mountains outside,” says giancarlo staubmann. all seven seasons of the mary tyler moore show are now streaming on hulu. after my parents got divorced, my mom used to let me stay up late so we could watch reruns together, and it was one of my favorite memories from childhood. when it comes to getting kids to each vegetables, how about these broccoli melts?

bless your soul, coj! march 26, 2020 2:14pm / reply kate says... oh my god, i love mtm! i have the first two seasons on dvd but i am now going to binge watch all 7 seasons. they are like tv comfort food for me (probably because i also watched them in childhood on nick at nite. very mary mondays!) and i need that desperately right now. also, to the cup of jo team, thank you for providing a space where our country’s current reality is taken seriously and discussed while still finding ways to give us all a bit of relief. it means a lot. march 26, 2020 12:15pm / reply mary says... last night my husband saw me scrolling through this post and asked what i was reading. “why are you reading the comments?” i told him the comments are the best part on coj! also just wanted to add: athleta has 25% their entire (online!) store right now and i am living in their joggers & elation leggings! if you like lulu, give them a try! i also love that they promote health, strength, diversity, and sustainability. march 26, 2020 12:03pm / reply lb says... for my own mental health and outlook, and despite the memes knocking us, i have been putting on jeans (or non-sweatpants) monday-friday, showering, sometimes even swiping on mascara. i need to feel like a real person and it helps me feel focused enough to keep working from home instead of just wanting to give up and eat 23203 snacks a day. so far it’s working but we’ll see how next week goes! march 26, 2020 11:14am / reply leah says... hot tip: the lou and grey sweats are cheaper on the ann taylor loft site. march 26, 2020 11:00am / reply joanna goddard says... thank you! march 26, 2020 12:19pm / jessica says... i have a pair of sweats by the brand kotn and they are incredible. sooo well made and a very flattering cut. i’ve been wearing them nonstop, and my husband still comments how cute i look in them despite this ;) march 26, 2020 10:40am / reply rebecca says... heads up that the lou and grey sweats are $30 on loft’s website! https://www.loft.com/lg-sweats/cat4410005?pcid=cat3390004&catfeature=true march 26, 2020 10:22am / reply celeste says... i’ve held off on buying anything but i did grab a pair of cropped jeans. it’s tempting to go for spring dresses but no one will see them. i will check out mtm. march 26, 2020 9:32am / reply olga @ mangotomato says... yoga pants, long sleeve tshirt. the key is to put on a bra. today i even washed my hair, put on makeup and earrings!!! it’s the little things, right? i hope my plants appreciate it ;) march 26, 2020 8:56am / reply kate says... also this mac & cheese recipe sneaks in an entire head of cauliflower. https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/cauliflower-mac-and-cheese/ march 26, 2020 8:53am / reply joanna goddard says... looks delicious! march 26, 2020 10:03am / katha says... for most of the recommended recipes for kids – like these broccoli melts – i would have to get my kids to eat cheese first. hahaha. march 26, 2020 4:52am / reply katie says... thank you for the comfort and joy your blog brings. coj does wonders for my mental health right now. march 26, 2020 12:25am / reply joanna goddard says... ❤️❤️❤️ march 26, 2020 10:03am / kristie says... i wish mtm and rhoda were available on streaming services in new zealand – i would love to watch them from scratch (i arrived in 1974 so vaguely remember it at the time. the fashion). on a side note i found an insta feed that has hilarious clips of dynasty – along with a one liner and an episode recap (e.g. ‘alexis is having one hell of a day and it’s only gotten worse because dex and ben got into a huge fight and trashed her penthouse’ – lols. march 25, 2020 11:56pm / reply jane says... i’ve been soooo tempted to splurge on a pair of cashmere sweat pants. ugh the restraint required. but i’d like to save money for the rest of this year just to be sure i’m ahead of the game. so it’s a beloved pair of super soft grey fleece leggings instead. even though i am going to get a pair of either merino or cashmere at some point soon because i read that acrylic and polyester are super toxic and i’m tired of the risk involved in wearing that next to my largest organ: my skin. ditto: a natural fabric bra search that doesn’t look hideous and is cushioned. march 25, 2020 11:40pm / reply goldenmoon says... i got a pair of vince cashmere sweat pants from tj maxx for a song. when the world re-opens… be safe everyone. coj, we’re thinking of you all in nyc. big hugs and thank you for continuing to uplift all of us as this unsettling time. march 26, 2020 11:28am / jax says... speaking of mtm, i’ve been watching the bob newhart show on hulu. perfect end-of-night, winding-down-for-bedtime comfort food sitcom. everybody’s lovely in it, esp. suzanne pleshette and newhart. also highly recommend midnight diner, the sweet japanese anthology show on netflix. it released season 2 a little while ago and i’m savoring it episode by episode. march 25, 2020 10:25pm / reply jax says... and also, the hartleys have the lovliest apartment/condo and layout on the bob newhart show. totally perfect for a modern couple. they have a fab wall shelving unit and at a later point, a beautiful thonet chair for the desk in the unit. march 25, 2020 10:30pm / kaitlin says... i’ve been really struggling with routine this second week of working from home. i am pulling out my lululemon pants a lot, and just ordered some gorgeous sweatpants from small brand franc. i haven’t owned real sweatpants since 7th grade! march 25, 2020 9:09pm / reply k says... oh my gosh! i used to watch mary tyler moore with my mom on nick at nite. i had no idea what it was about, but i think i just liked her hat toss and how she had the same haircut as my mom. march 25, 2020 9:01pm / reply hannah says... my kids hate cooked veggies but will eat them raw all day long, which is crazy. to combat the pre-dinner desire for snacking, i put out a plate of chopped raw veggies and my kids eat it all without hesitation. win! march 25, 2020 8:29pm / reply bridgette says... just want to say i love coj community and thanks for being here. march 25, 2020 8:07pm / reply joanna goddard says... what a lovely comment. thank you and i agree — i’m so thankful for these wonderful women. march 26, 2020 10:01am / iris says... those broc melts are the absolute bomb! my son asks for those every time he sees us put broccoli in our shopping cart. they even reheat well for lunch the next day (if, for some reason, you have leftovers). march 25, 2020 7:09pm / reply ashley says... thanks coj team! any plans to feature covid-19 experiences? as someone showing symptoms (may not be tested), i’m longing to know what others are doing – how are you handling co-habitating with your children? what if your partner gets sick? day to day symptoms progression? the news is too difficult to handle…. thanks for considering! march 25, 2020 6:30pm / reply julie says... i second this idea. i thought i was symptomatic two days ago with a low fever, but who knows what it was. my partner has to go in to work as his industry shows no signs of stopping. our exposure will be ongoing. so many stories to share out there and so many unknowns to get to know. cup of joe could do this topic justice. march 25, 2020 10:16pm / jane says... is there new “news”? i’ve understood that unless you’re over 60 or have a pre-existing health concern you shouldn’t experience anything beyond an average cold. the issue is that you could be dangerously contagious and for that reason need to isolate for a whatever the period of time is – something like 10 days past the last of your symptoms… march 25, 2020 11:32pm / celeste says... there was a great piece in the nyt on a queens hospital that has now seen everyone from 38 year old cardiac arrest after covid to a ventilator shortage. a 12 year old is hospitalized in queens. to say this is like a cold or flu is negligent at this point. it’s unprecedented. march 26, 2020 9:24am / jane says... @jane: no, that is not accurate. i am in europe and there are people as young as 18 or 20 sick (very sick) and intubated in the hospitals and some have even died. most of the fatal cases are as you described, but not all of them by a long shot. there was even an otherwise healthy 2 year-old in a hospital near me in intensive care for weeks. thankfully, he/she is better now. 80 per cent of cases seem to be mild, but not all of them, not only for the older generation, and scientists are only beginning to see patterns and understand why. please do not spread information like this; this virus is not harmless for the not-elderly/ healthy! march 26, 2020 4:08pm / lenae says... i have been rotating two pairs of lululemon align yoga pants, plus some random target sweats. i put on jeans to go grocery shopping yesterday and it felt so wrong. i also just bought amazon’s align-knockoff yoga pants for $25 (nearly a quarter of the lulu price!). they’re delayed until april 1 so clearly i’m not the only person who had the same idea. march 25, 2020 6:30pm / reply lucy says... wait, what are the amazon knockoffs?! link please! march 25, 2020 8:39pm / ljg says... i was considering buying some sweat/lounge pants last night because i realized i actually needed new pajama pants. every single website i looked at was sold out/backordered really significantly. march 26, 2020 10:02am / maggie says... yes, pray do tell: what is the link to these amazon align knockoffs?! march 26, 2020 3:11pm / mali says... what i’m wearing at home? how about what i’m not wearing? no bra. the best! march 25, 2020 5:56pm / reply courtney says... high five! free boob solidarity. march 25, 2020 7:56pm / kristin says... how will we ever go back?! march 25, 2020 8:08pm / kelly says... helllllll yes! march 25, 2020 9:23pm / becky says... i agree! march 25, 2020 9:30pm / caro says... a friendly note–it’s rihanna, not rhianna. or, to be specific, our queen and savior, king rihanna. <3. march 25, 2020 5:45pm / reply yvie says... omg. me too!! my mom and i would watch reruns every night before bed. loved mlm, although it really screwed me up on how i thought single life would go. and looking back, rhoda was far cooler. cemented my love of seventies fashion forever. march 25, 2020 5:43pm / reply jax says... yes, rhoda rawks!!! i hated that the storylines were often about her insecurity about her perfectly lovely body and comparison of her looks with mtm’s, even if it was a positive destination for her in the end. i liked her friendship with mtm though. march 25, 2020 10:36pm / k says... i agree re: rhoda! and i was so sad rewatching it in college seeing how much she obsessed about her weight like wtf she was not fat at all. march 25, 2020 11:12pm / cmg says... yesss mtm! one of my favorite memories is watching with my mom too! march 25, 2020 4:28pm / reply becka says... even though i’m not working from home (wisconsin went under a “safer at home” order this morning, but i’m within the construction supply chain so currently deemed essential – but i’m a designer and with our showroom closed we have no new sales to make, so how essential will surely decrease), i read a piece on the cut last week about lou & grey sweats and ordered a set. i can’t wait for them to come! i even was a good girl and got what looks like a fun shade of green instead of black. springy, you know? march 25, 2020 4:16pm / reply danielle says... just treated myself to some lounge wear after a stressful few days. buying a house during a pandemic is not for the faint of heart! this jumpsuit is the softest. https://www.ae.com/us/en/p/aerie/dresses-jumpsuits/jumpsuits-rompers/aerie-softest-sleep-jumpsuit/0661_9872_357?menu=cat4840006 march 25, 2020 4:04pm / reply amy k says... i have been sneaking veggies into all the muffins i have been making while at home. so far, i have used zucchini, carrots, and sweet potatoes in various recipes. next up is a spinach/banana combo. march 25, 2020 3:53pm / reply e says... i also love the lou & grey sweats so much but do they not shed fuzzies all over your house?! march 25, 2020 3:52pm / reply ramona says... mary and rhoda’s style was so, so cool. and when i’m watching the reruns today i always say how much i still love their style and how easily it could be worn today. classic beauties. <3 march 25, 2020 3:51pm / reply b says... i feel like all the 70s and 80s fashion has circled back to today. i watch golden girls and blanche’s style is especially relevant – lots of jumpsuits, pretty blouses, etc. she kept most of her wardrobe from the show and had 13 closets in her home. march 25, 2020 6:37pm / lexie says... i watched several seasons of mary tyler moore when i was in college and i just loved it. one of my all time favorite episodes of tv is season 2 episode 24, “his two right arms.” it is hilarious! after i graduated i moved into my own one bedroom apartment and i used to pretend i was mary, coming home from a long day of work! i became close with my neighbors and the whole vibe felt very mary-approved! march 25, 2020 3:42pm / reply mkw says... i even put an “m” on the wall of my first apartment…. 30+ years ago. gulp. march 25, 2020 5:06pm / slybk says... hi! i just wanted to let you know (because of your sweatshirt lead) that american giant, the sweatshirt company, has stopped making sweatshirts and other clothes at their nc factory and started making masks. their initial goal is 35,000 a week, but they hope to do better after a week or two. i say this because when this dies down it would be so great if everyone should consider buying their clothes to acknowledge the effort. oh, and, their sweatshirts are (a) awesome, (b) reasonably priced, and (c) made in america. just in case you want to add their wares to the next comfortable at home post. (p.s. i don’t work for them…haha) march 25, 2020 3:11pm / reply rae says... thanks so much for sharing this. my husband is an er doctor and i want all the companies to make all the protective gear and ventilators right now. deal? i promise to buy everyone a sweatshirt when we make it through if we can protect out front line workers (i see you grocery store clerk). march 25, 2020 5:13pm / bailey says... and point (d) the majority of their sweats are cotton, unlike the acrylic/rayon blend of the lou and gray sweats. march 25, 2020 6:25pm / b says... i will check them out. i am a sucker for a cozy sweatshirt, especially from a company that does good and is based/made in the us. march 25, 2020 6:38pm / an says... today and every day, american giant is the best! their sweats are unmatched. march 25, 2020 7:44pm / jenn p says... i have a pair of their joggers, and they are the best. they’re not “comfy cozy lazy around the house“ joggers, they’re more “i can wear these out of the house with cute sneaks and a chambray with a casual front tuck to meet girlfriends for brunch” joggers. they wash well, and i’ve had them for over a year and they still hold their shape. highly recommend. march 25, 2020 7:53pm / courtney says... so good to know! thank you! march 25, 2020 7:59pm / alexis says... love this! my husband and i both have american giant hoodies and they are the best. plus i think mine is slimming maybe? march 25, 2020 8:26pm / m says... if you love mary tyler moore which i did and still do. please watch the spin-off rhoda. the whole 5 seasons are available on youtube and you will totally love this show! p.s: rhoda’s outfits on her show are so cute! march 25, 2020 3:08pm / reply arlene says... i don’t even like broccoli, but this was such a good lunch to have! march 27, 2020 9:45am / lizzie says... wow how crazy! i just made deb’s broccoli melts for lunch today. they are great!!! march 25, 2020 2:53pm / reply cancel reply comment name email website notify me of follow-up comments by email. about / contact joanna goddard brighten up your inbox let’s hang out contact me disclosure in order to grow our small business, cup of jo earns revenue in a few different ways. we publish several sponsored posts each month, which are always labeled at the top. we also sometimes earn an affiliate commission on the sales of products we link to. we feature only items we genuinely love and want to share, and this is an arrangement between the retailer and cup of jo (readers never pay more for products). these are the ways we support cup of jo, and allow us to run the site and engage with this community we truly love. thank you for reading! you might also like style “what do i wear to a winter wedding?” and other reader questions food the freshest potato salad design times i think people are upset with me travel how to find that great vacation restaurant, and other burning questions relationships the many ways to say “i love you” motherhood life advice for my college-bound daughter about a cup of jo welcome! a cup of jo is a daily lifestyle site for women. we cover everything from fashion to culture to parenthood, and we strive to be authentic. as olive kitteridge said, "there's no such thing as a simple life." thank you for reading. read more style food design travel relationships motherhood about contact faq let's hang out
