they don’t have jobs!” fox business correspondent charlie gasparino agreed that mnuchin’s statement was “horrible.” “you’ve got to choose your words very carefully,” cavuto remarked. “they are human beings who are desperately looking for something.” tags: charles gasparino, fox business, neil cavuto, unemployment facebook twitter pinterest flipboard email can you help us out?
