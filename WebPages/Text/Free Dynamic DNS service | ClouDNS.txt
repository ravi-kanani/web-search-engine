dynamic dns is a dns service, which provides the option to change the ip address of one or multiple dns records automatically when the ip address of your device is changed dynamically by the internet provider. the service is also called ddns or dyn dns in technical jargon. if you don’t have a static ip, then the ip changes each time you reconnect to the internet. to avoid manual update of your records every time the ip changes, you can set up dynamic dns for your domain. the pros of ddns if you are considering a static ip address, it is important to remember that there are many different advantages that come with having one. naturally there are also disadvantages. one of the downsides of configuring a static ip address is that it can grow quite expensive. free dynamic dns by cloudns is often regarded as a much more portable option and it will continue to work whether you have a dynamic or static ip address. the way that dynamic dns works is by giving a network device the ability to notify dns servers to automatically change in real time, alongside the active dns configuration, ip addresses, configured hostnames and some other information. this is something that would normally have to be initiated by the administrator. benefits from the dynamic dns some of the main benefits of setting a dynamic dns include: improved accessibility: you can make sure that your system will use the consistent name in the url you type, even if the ip address for that url consistently changes. efficiency: there is no need to continually change settings on every pc each time you want to change network infrastructure or other options. cost savings: you can have many addresses which can all be used at one time rather than the chance of ip address conflict. switching to a dynamic dns is a fairly easy process and whether you are a business owner or you are interested in working remotely with the help of a vpn, needing remote access for your devices or just hosting your own personal website, it will be helpful to have the advantage of dynamic dns on your side. consider some of these top advantages and more to switching over to dynamic dns and remember that there are plenty of tutorials on our website on how to set up this process and begin. free dynamic dns by cloudns cloudns provides free dynamic dns with all dns hosting plans. sign up new account for free from here. how to configure dynamic dns?
