home comments policy subscribe free readings! by ingrid robeyns on march 21, 2020 many of us are currently locked up, in one way or another. for some of us this means no time for leisure – the people who are ill, the health workers currently making heroic double and triple shifts, workers struggling to get their work done in a virtual way, and parents and other careworkers being overwhelmed by the 24/7 homeschooling and carework. but for others, it means more time to read or watch movies, since there is nowhere to go. and given that acts of kindness and solidarity are now especially important, it’s nice to see that some publishing houses are putting out some of their book for free for everyone to download. thanks! let’s share what we know is available. here’s a start – verso is offering 5 books (in ebook format) for free, which are all contributions to the post-pandemic world we might want to strive for. and of course, pandemic or no pandemic, fully open access academic publishers, such as open book publishers, are always providing us with free readings. not all pdfs are for free, but some are, including noam chomsky’s delhi lectures on democracy and power. have you come across other intellectual, artistic, entertaining or otherwise valuable resources that have been made freely available to all?

this link starts an automatic series of very short (average 1 minute) videos as a single story. your kids might like it too. i’m always making new ones, reformatting and reshuffling, so suggestions are more than welcome. 14 john 03.22.20 at 12:14 pm i second c. castro recommendation –check your local library system for hoopla and overdrive. ebooks (inlcuding economics, science, etc.), tv, movies, etc., available in multiple languages. if your library sponsors author events, they may be available on the library’s pod cast page and youtube. catch up on exciting lectures that you’ve missed! as this crisis subsides, don’t forget to make a donation to the library. 15 novakant 03.22.20 at 12:37 pm great idea, ingrid, here are some more links (i’m trying this again): the berlin philharmonics offer 30 days free streaming: https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/en/home the met opera offers nightly free streams: https://www.metopera.org/user-information/nightly-met-opera-streams/ 16 mike huben 03.22.20 at 2:30 pm “z-library is one of the largest online libraries in the world that contains over 4,960,000 books and 77,100,000 articles. we aim to make literature accessible to everyone.” https://en.b-ok.org 17 chris bertram 03.22.20 at 3:25 pm and if you are willing to pay for books, then if you have a local independent bookshop, they may well be running a free delivery service (or post) during the pandemic. such businesses find it tough to operate and may well go under if we don’t support them, to the benefit of jeff bezos. so, a suggestion: if possible give them some money on account against future orders now. 18 nnyhav 03.22.20 at 4:03 pm what chris said @ 17 … in nyc: https://mailchi.mp/archipelagobooks/independent-booksellers-need-us?e=3b820108ef 19 ingrid robeyns 03.22.20 at 4:05 pm thanks all for the free suggestions – and totally agree with chris about supporting our local booksellers! 20 sc 03.22.20 at 8:15 pm you can vote for the next day’s free ebook on the seven stories press twitter. some fantastic titles in the list(s). (maybe some octavia butler titles will make the list!) https://twitter.com/7storiespress/status/1241782215274565633 21 donald 03.22.20 at 8:19 pm i clicked on the link to open book publishers and got a warning saying that the link wasn’t private, someone impersonating a website might be trying to steal my data, etc… anybody know what that is about? 22 ph 03.23.20 at 12:55 am i’ll second chris @ 17. i just sent a list of free online resources to quarantined relatives in the uk. but abe books (used bookstore global network) has an excellent selection of titles in a variety of languages. this a great time to buy a book and help out. 23 miken 03.23.20 at 3:56 am i am curious about “yesterday’s man”. i suspect it is proof positive that in this time of crisis we need biden to step aside and offer the nomination to bernie!, the man of the hour. 24 ethylester 03.23.20 at 9:14 pm your public library is probably closed but you can still check out e-books and audiobooks remotely. download libby, enter library card number and pin, start browsing. (apologies for repetition if someone has already pointed this out.) 25 kent 03.24.20 at 1:32 am it isn’t super intellectual, for sure … but zach weinersmith has free ebooks (mostly comics and silly stuff) available on his website right now. https://www.smbc-comics.com/covid/ 26 peter t 03.24.20 at 10:28 am another good way to pass the time at home is to help lift the standard of self-published work (and it badly needs a lift) by joining any of the numerous beta-reader sites for aspiring authors. one australian one is: https://www.facebook.com/groups/everythingaboutnovels/ you might even find some gold amid the dross. 27 lucy barnes 03.24.20 at 4:11 pm great to see obp mentioned here ingrid, thank you! just to say that pdfs of every obp book are freely downloadable or readable online, and all html and xml editions can also be freely read and downloaded. people might also want to check out the directory of open access books (https://www.doabooks.org/) and oapen library (http://www.oapen.org/home) which share tens of thousands of oa books, including obp’s. there’s also the scholarled presses (https://scholarled.org/) who are all open access academic book publishers (obp is one). 28 javi 03.24.20 at 5:03 pm hi @donald, sorry about that, on sunday we had an issue with the certificate at obp’s website. it’s been fixed since monday morning – so feel free to visit again! 29 bianca steele 03.25.20 at 5:21 pm seconding the recommendation for hoopla. their collection of nonfiction ebooks on all subjects is surprisingly extensive, but the “genre” menu is easy to miss and necessary for avoiding the algorithm. they also have a wide range of resources for kids. comments on this entry are closed. recent comments ravedubin on borders fake dave on crises and the case for socialism j-d on crises and the case for socialism faustusnotes on crises and the case for socialism k on borders search contributors chris bertram ∞ harry brighouse ∞ daniel davies ∞ henry farrell ∞ maria farrell ∞ eszter hargittai ∞ kieran healy ∞ john holbo ∞ serene khader ∞ scott mclemee ∞ john quiggin ∞ eric rauchway ∞ ingrid robeyns ∞ corey robin ∞ miriam ronzoni ∞ gina schouten ∞ astra taylor ∞ belle waring ∞ brian weatherson ∞ rich yeselson∞ old growth michael bérubé ∞ niamh hardiman ∞ jon mandle ∞ montagu norman ∞ tedra osell ∞ tom runnacles ∞ micah schwartzman ∞ click on the ∞ symbol next to a name for a list of all of that author's posts. book events jo walton / thessaly books danielle allen / our constitution ken macleod / various felix gilman / the half-made world/the rise of ransom city jack knight and james johnson / the priority of democracy francis spufford / red plenty david graeber / debt: the first 5,000 years erik olin wright / envisioning real utopias george scialabba / what are intellectuals good for? steven teles / the rise of the conservative legal movement charles stross / various china miéville / iron council chris mooney / the republican war on science dani rodrik / one economics, many recipes joseph carens / the ethics of immigration doug henwood / after the new economy levitt & dubner / freakonomics sheri berman / the primacy of politics susanna clarke / jonathan strange & mr norrell yochai benkler / the wealth of networks lumber room 11d 3 quarks daily a fistful of euros atrios balkinization best of both worlds bleeding heart libertarians blood and treasure brad delong cosma shalizi corey robin critical mass daily kos daily nous daniel drezner digby ed felten eric schliesser edge of the american west feminist philosophers firedoglake glenn greenwald the inverse square jacobin jim henley joshua marshall juan cole kevin drum lawrence solum lawyers, guns and money making light marc lynch marginal revolution mark thoma maud newton michael froomkin miriam burstein naked capitalism new left project the new inquiry pharyngula political theory daily review politics, theory and photography russell arben fox slugger o’toole sociological images steven johnson steven poole talk left tapped the virtual stoa tim lambert timothy burke uncertain principles yorkshire ranter
