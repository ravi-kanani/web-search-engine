fresh as a daisy attempting to start an organic allotment from scratch sunday, august 21, 2011 summer crops and harvesting: in pictures we've only cultivated about a third of the plot so far, however there is plenty going on! here is our summer on the plot so far... ﻿ cabbages and brocolli growing fast! ﻿ first signs of brocolli head freshly picked french beans courgette ready for harvesting ﻿ late season spuds... one of our winter crops ﻿﻿﻿ nothing beats the taste of fresh peas from the pod picking beans and peas! summer spud harvest! butternut squash doing well... just one squash plant and it is absolutely massive! yellow variety of courgette ﻿ ﻿ we had a good crop of broad beans ﻿ ﻿ cabbages growing rapidly after lots of rain and sunshine! and finally... this is what happens when you don't visit the plot for a couple of weeks or so.... we discovered a giant courgette the size of a beach ball! reactions: no comments: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest saturday, july 02, 2011 making plans this afternoon i spent the best part of two hours making a net cover for the cabbages and broccoli. it took ages to weave string through the net to make it nice and sturdy... i think it will be worth it though. james worked like a trouper and made a new bed with the big pointy spade which was a big job! it needs more digging to make more of a fine tilth and we'll be planting kale and romanesco in there shortly. it's so good to actually see things growing and although it is slow progress getting the plot productive, we do have quite a few bits of pieces in the ground at the moment! we worked out that the new bed dug today means that we've reached halfway up the plot on that side now. it looks like we should have space for six veg beds covering half the plot and the other half will be fruit. we also have plans for a little grass area in the middle to sit on, a small herb area and some storage and composting. it feels like we are really close to breaking the back of this huge project to get our bit of land productive. so much so that today we felt that we'd reached the point of needing to make a sketch of how we are going to use the 'fruit' half of the plot. there is light at the end of the tunnel! reactions: no comments: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) other pages home our plot... archives archives august 2011 (1) july 2011 (1) june 2011 (3) may 2011 (2) october 2010 (2) september 2010 (3) august 2010 (1) july 2010 (1) april 2010 (2) october 2009 (4) september 2009 (1) march 2009 (3) february 2009 (1) december 2008 (1) september 2008 (1) august 2008 (1) june 2008 (1) may 2008 (4) april 2008 (3) march 2008 (2) february 2008 (2) january 2008 (4) november 2007 (1) october 2007 (1) september 2007 (2) august 2007 (5) july 2007 (1) june 2007 (11) may 2007 (8) april 2007 (19) march 2007 (16) february 2007 (13) january 2007 (22) december 2006 (5) looking for something?
