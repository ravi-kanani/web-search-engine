(my first book, risky issues, was released in 2014.) in this article (blog post), i will tell you -who i am -why you should listen to me -all about my book -where you can buy it -where you can get 2 free chapters -my mission who am i? hi. my name is lorraine. and i am someone who has suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts for most of my life. i am someone who has suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts for most of my life. you can read about my life journey (what i‚Äôve been through, where i used to be, and where i am now). in fact, please do, you‚Äôll be happy you did. if you also suffer from such things, know that i‚Äôve been where you are. i‚Äôve felt your hopelessness and despair. you don‚Äôt know what to do. you don‚Äôt know who to turn to. you are at your wits‚Äô end. these feelings are horrible. they consume you. they take over your thoughts and influence your actions. you feel like you have no control. you feel like there‚Äôs no hope. you think the only solution is to end it all, eliminating all your problems forever. i get it. i know exactly how you feel‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs awful to feel this way! i felt this way for years. yes, years. i even tried to kill myself once. (read my true story about my suicide attempt.) the good news is that i survived. i‚Äôve since learned different coping strategies and ways to handle my problems. even more good news is this: you, too, have the ability within yourself to change yourself and your situation! i am not a magician, and the answers i have for you will sometimes require you to put forth some effort, but if you trust me and listen to me, i can assure you that your suicidal thoughts will dissipate, your mindset will change, your outlook will be healthier, your future will be brighter, and you will be happier. during this process, i will be there for you. i will help you through it all. i will help you to discover new ways of coping with your problems. i will teach you techniques you can use in your daily life to improve it. i will share strategies you can employ to make yourself feel better. not only will i offer you hope, but i will outline the steps you can take in order to become happier, healthier, and more successful in life! i‚Äôm also going to share some of my personal experiences with you throughout this book. you might not have the exact same problems as i did (and still have, on occasion), but you will be able to compare your life against mine. you will be able to change your thoughts. you will be able to improve your situation. you will become happier with your life. the structure of from nope to hope throughout this book, i am going to be sharing some of my personal experiences with you. i‚Äôm also going to give you specific tasks to do. these are the actions you will need to perform to see the results you want. they are found at the end of each chapter and are called ‚Äúthought and action exercises.‚Äù they are not hard. most of them don‚Äôt take a lot of time either. they are designed to be extremely useful to you, too. keep an open mind and give them a try, when you are instructed to. you have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. i promise you, if you listen to me, it will be worth it! why you should listen to me i am honest. i am educated. i have endured a lot of pain during my life. i have faced many obstacles. i was raped. i quit school four times. i got involved in prostitution. i became a single mother at the age of 18. i raised my son by myself. i became addicted to drugs. i also had a gambling addiction. i know what it‚Äôs like to have no motivation or desire to live. i have suffered from depression and an extremely negative self-image. i have been overweight my whole life. i also lost contact with my son for three years. fortunately, we reunited! but, despite all these obstacles, i was still able to overcome them and move on. why? i sought counseling. i learned how to cope with all my problems. i found hope. fortunately for me, i have an above-average iq, and i‚Äôm highly skilled in many areas. i attended university for 5 years and obtained two degrees. i became a math and english teacher. i am still a certified teacher, although i quit teaching high school students. i teach others online now. i also started my own freelancing business and became an author. this is my second published book, and i have plans to write more. i also help others become authors! i am currently living life on my own terms, under my own rules and flexible schedule, and i am happier ‚Äì and freer ‚Äì than i have ever been. i‚Äôm not going to lie to you, though. i still have bad days. i still get depressed on occasion. like i said, i‚Äôm an honest person. i‚Äôm human, after all, and life is not always easy, regardless of where you live, what you do, or how much money you have. in fact, writing this book was one of the hardest things i have done. i‚Äôm a perfectionist, and i wanted it to be the best resource in the world for people like you, who are plagued with suicidal thoughts, perhaps suffering from depression, and are basically so unhappy that death seems like the only solution. i wanted to make sure it helped you in many ways. i wanted it to cover every possible reason for why you would want to end your life, and then offer solutions to you for each of these reasons. but i realized that this would be an impossible task because if you ask 1000 different people you will get 1000 different answers for why they would want to do this. however, the commonality would be that they all simply want to end their pain. so, instead, what i decided to do is create this book around the strategies that have helped me change my life. these are the same strategies that others have used to change theirs, to end their pain, and move on. not only will i provide you with information, i will also teach you these strategies and guide you so that you can implement them in your life. once you start implementing them, you will begin to see results. your life will become one that is more positive, and hopefully, one that you want to live. this is a picture of me, taken in the summer of 2017. don‚Äôt i look happy?
