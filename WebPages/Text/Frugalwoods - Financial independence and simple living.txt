but when i sat down to write what i’d previously planned on my editorial calendar (don’t be impressed, it’s just my regular calendar, but “editorial” sounds so, well, editorial), i realized i had no enthusiasm or energy for “regular” topics. we’re all feeling the impact of the coronavirus in some way, or we will soon, and we should all be preparing for what’s almost certain to... 119 coronavirus

month on the homestead 13 mar, 2020 this month on the homestead: birthday baking, icicle hiking, and getting stuck on my own driveway february 2020 in a winter populated by snow storms, in a climate where cold is more familiar that warmth, and a region mythologized by horse-drawn sleighs breaking through snow, february went above and beyond. several overachieving storms bent tree branches to the earth with the weight of snow piled on ice piled on snow. crunching through this ice/snow laminate on snow shoes breaks the silence that follows a storm as all critters, save we humans,... 130 reader

people ask me about childcare all the time. how to pay for it, how to find it, what i do with my kids. other than what to eat for lunch, which credit cards to use, and how to buy used cars, i think childcare is the most asked question i get from readers. and it’s the one thing on that list i haven’t devoted a lot of time to writing about. probably because i’m not... 132 featured / frugalwoods philosophy 26 feb, 2020 environmentalism, frugality, and minimalism: the triumvirate that’ll save you money and simplify your life environmentalism, frugality, and minimalism are intertwined. they form a complementary, interconnected system that goes something like this: need less, buy less, use less, consume less, spend less, deplete less…. and finally, want less. today, i want to discuss how these three values can work in concert to save money, reduce stress, and inform choices. much of frugality, environmentalism, and minimalism is encapsulated by doing less. it’s more compelling to buy into expensive “solutions” engineered to... 112 entertainment 21 feb, 2020 10 ways to spot a frugal friend. #4 involves dryer lint. you: walking around town wearing hand-me-downs, sipping coffee from

horrifically awkward? how to... 126 reader suggestions 14 feb, 2020 reader suggestions: what’s the weirdest thing you’ve done to save money? i’ve been called a frugal weirdo. i’ve been called an

the homestead: breathe deeply, expect nothing, add carrots january 2020 january delivers a stark reminder that the holiday festivities are finished and that snow is in residence until may. january meets us with a grim reminder that we ought gird ourselves for consistency of weather and of activity. it’s a month of monochromatic sameness. but january is also the time for decluttering and new recipes and woodstove worship. it’s an exercise in locating beauty in the mundane. in finding stillness among the snow-soaked... 141 reader case studies 7 feb, 2020 reader case study: debtors
