belarus in 1978. he lived with 8 family members in a studio apartment in queens, new york, before relocating to edison, new jersey. gary often calls himself a ‚Äúpurebred entrepreneur‚Äù having successfully started a lemonade franchise at age 7, and eventually selling tens of thousands of dollars worth of baseball cards and toys throughout his high school career. at 14 he joined his family business bagging ice for $2/hr. when gary identified ‚Äúthe internet‚Äù as a land-grab opportunity in the late 90‚Äôs he transitioned his father‚Äôs local liquor store (then named ‚Äúshoppers discount liquors‚Äù) into one of the first e-commerce platforms for alcohol in the country resulting in explosive top-line growth. renaming the business to ‚Äúwine library,‚Äù gary grew his father‚Äôs company from $3-60mm in sales during his tenure at wine library. during his time at wine library, gary vaynerchuk started one of the first long-form episodic video shows on youtube in 2006 called winelibrarytv. gary produced an episode almost every day for 5 years . gary‚Äôs charisma and uncanny ability to engage with his community landed him appearances on national television with ellen degeneres and conan o‚Äôbrien. after growing his family business through what gary calls ‚Äúunderpriced attention,‚Äù including the impact of content, ecommerce, email marketing, and google adwords, gary began his own journey of producing original business content as the voice of entrepreneurship online. in 2008, gary gave a keynote at web 2.0 in new york city that would ultimately change his career. that speech solidified and was the backbone of gary‚Äôs $1m, 10-book deal with harpercollins leading to his first book, crush it! in 2009 which went on to become an international bestseller laying the foundation for his principles on media, marketing, and communication. soon after, gary began angel investing in notable companies including facebook, twitter, tumblr, uber, snap and venmo. replicating what gary had done for winelibrary for other businesses and brands, vaynerchuk then co-founded vaynermedia in 2009 with his younger brother, aj vaynerchuk. true to his own dna, gary never raised startup funding and began the business in a conference room at buddy media. just 9 years later, the company now includes more than 800 employees, servicing clients such as pepsico, ge, johnson and johnson, chase, abinbev and more. vaynermedia has flourished into having built best-in-class capabilities in paid media, strategy, full-service creative, influencer marketing, iot & voice, ecommerce, personal branding, smb marketing and in-house consulting. in 2017, vaynermedia entered the publishing space by acquiring premiere women‚Äôs magazine purewow under the gallery media group and restructured into vaynerx. in the summer of 2018, the second media brand under the gallery media group umbrella, men‚Äôs lifestyle brand one37pm was launched. true to his word, while scaling his business, gary continued to behave as media company on his own writing 4 more new york times bestselling business books and becoming one of the most sought after public speakers.. 5 years in, gary launched #askgaryvee, a business and advice q&a show online which later led him to launch dailyvee, a full-blown vlog documenting his life as a ceo. pioneering the practice of building a personal brand, gary devised a new content strategy by producing these pillar shows. today, gary has more than 12m combined followers across social media, producing content daily on instagram, youtube, facebook, twitter, linkedin, snapchat, spotify and more. gary also hosts a global top 100 business podcast, the garyvee audio experience, which features new episodes every day. in the fall of 2017, gary announced his first signature sneakers in collaboration with k-swiss. the garyvee 001 & 002s were released in november 2017, the garyvee 003s were released in july 2018 & the garyvee 004s will be released later this year. gary‚Äôs life ambition is the pursuit of buying the new york jets. early life gary vaynerchuk was born in babruysk, belarus, in the former ussr. his parents were fortunate enough to find their way to america as part of an exchange program where soviet jews were allowed to immigrate to the us in exchange for food aid. while the entire extended family shared a studio apartment in queens, gary‚Äôs father sasha began working at a relative‚Äôs liquor store in new jersey and eventually moved the family to edison, nj. as a young child, gary began his entrepreneurial career by ripping flowers out of his neighbors‚Äô yards and using his natural charm to sell them right back (a profit margin he has still yet to equal). soon he had upgraded to operating an entire lemonade stand franchise, managing multiple locations and commuting via big-wheel to collect his profits. in his early teens, gary cornered the local market for baseball cards, often making thousands in a weekend with his keen eye for deals, and his razor-sharp sales-tactics. all of this came to a halt when, at the age of 14, gary‚Äôs father literally dragged him into the family business. in the blink of an eye he went from making thousands of dollars in a weekend to making $2 an hour bagging ice in the basement of shoppers discount liquors, which his father had taken full ownership of by that point. wine library as soon as gary realized that people could collect wine in the same way that he collected baseball cards, everything changed. soon he was sneaking copies of wine spectator into class to read up on the latest bordeaux vintages, and displaying his encyclopedic knowledge on the shop floor. while at college (where he went home every weekend to keep working at the store), gary discovered a brand new invention aweing his dormmates: the internet. he immediately saw the potential to ‚Äúsell shit‚Äù and set about convincing his father to let him have a website built for shopper‚Äôs discount liquor. and so, winelibrary.com was born. over the following years, gary would make it his mission to be a first mover wherever he could see sales opportunities: from email marketing, to google adwords to flash sales. this approach dramatically increased sales, driving ‚Äì the now rebranded ‚Äì wine library from $3mm to $60mm in sales in just five years. then, in 2006, gary decided to pursue a new avenue of content marketing, making his foray into creating video content, and changing his life forever‚Ä¶ wine library tv (the thunder show) in 2006, gary created a youtube vlog called wine library tv. the show featured wine reviews and advice on wine appreciation in gary‚Äôs unique, down-to-earth yet bombastic styler. episodes consisted of wine tastings along with other wine related topics and were produced at a breakneck speed of one 20-minute episode per day. the show eventually reached cult status, and gary began to get calls from local news outlets who wanted to interview ‚Äúthe internet wine guy.‚Äù this culminated in an appearance on conan o‚Äôbrien that ultimately launched gary into the limelight. as the show continued, gary proceeded to invite guests onto the show with him, beginning with well known wine personalities like jancis robinson, and moving onto mainstream celebrities and sports personalities like wayne gretzky. wine library tv went on for 1000 episodes before gary decided it was time to end the show. fame, keynotes, and angel investing in the process of gary‚Äôs meteoric rise to fame as a web personality, he fostered relationships with various ceos and investors like kevin rose, travis kalanick, ev williams, and mark zuckerberg. these connections lead to gary‚Äôs first forays into angel investing with early involvement with companies like twitter, facebook and, tumblr. during this time, gary also embarked on what would become a prolific career as a public speaker, delivering his first ever keynote at the web 2.0 expo in 2008 (the content of which would become the basis for his first book, crush it!). all of this lead gary to become a fixture at major tech events, including south by southwest interactive, where his off-the-grid ‚Äúsecret wine party‚Äù became a yearly tradition for those in the know. vaynermedia in 2009, after walking away from wine library tv, gary and his brother aj, who had recently graduated from college, founded vaynermedia, an agency focused on helping large brands tell their stories on social media. securing early clients like the new york jets, and the nhl allowed them to scale at a rapid pace, outgrowing three offices, and scaling to over 500 employees in just six years. vaynermedia now represents fortune 500 clients like general electric, anheuser-busch inbev, and pepsi-co, and recently announced their move to hudson yards, manhattan‚Äôs hotly anticipated, multi-billion dollar development. the #askgaryvee show in 2014, after spending two years building his own personal content production team, gary launched a new (semi) daily youtube show called the #askgaryvee show. on it, gary takes questions from people on twitter and instagram, responding to them in his typical unrehearsed, off the cuff manner. questions are pre-screened by his team, but gary never hears them ahead of time, ensuring raw, honest answers on everything from marketing, to entrepreneurship, to family, to the ny jets. the success of the show helped gary grow his youtube following to over 130,000 users, and paved the way for follow-on content on sites like medium, linkedin, inc, and huffington post. vayner/rse and brave ventures in 2014, gary partnered with matt higgins from rse ventures to form a $25 million investment fund focusing on first round financing and incubation. the fund has made over 30 investments, and is currently incubating two companies that gary is directly involved with: resy and faithbox. later that year, gary started yet another innovative company, this time in collaboration with tv industry leaders jesse redniss and david beck. brave ventures focuses on advising tv networks and startups on how to collaborate in today‚Äôs business environment. additionally brave invests in emerging tv, and second-screen startups. subscribe for access to exclusive content. lorem ipsum dolor test√ó subscribe must
