monck (1570–1627) one of the members of parliament for camelford in 1626, a member of a landed gentry family of ancient origins but then-straitened financial circumstances.[3] sir thomas's wife and george's mother was elizabeth smith, a daughter by his first marriage of sir george smith (d. 1619) of madworthy, near exeter,[4] devon, a merchant who served as a member for exeter in 1604, was three times mayor of exeter and the city of exeter's richest citizen, being lord of 25 surrounding manors.[5] elizabeth's sister grace smith was the wife of sir bevil grenville[6] (1596–1643), of bideford in devon and stowe, kilkhampton in cornwall, the royalist soldier killed in action during the civil war in heroic circumstances at the battle of lansdowne in 1643. sir bevil's son and heir, and thus george monck's first cousin, was john grenville, 1st earl of bath (1628–1701), a fellow supporter of the restoration, whose elevation to the peerage was largely due to monck's influence.[7] early life and career having assaulted the under sheriff of the county in revenge for a wrong done to his father, monck was forced to go abroad.[3] becoming a soldier, he served as a volunteer in the 1626 expedition to cadiz,[3] and the next year fought well at the siege of the île de ré (an abortive attempt to aid french protestants in the city of la rochelle).[3][8] in 1629 monck went to the netherlands, then a theatre of warfare, and there he gained a high reputation as a leader and as a disciplinarian. he fought bravely at the 1637 siege of breda, always first in the breach of his men. in 1638 he surrendered his commission in consequence of a quarrel with the civil authorities of dordrecht and returned to england.[3] he was appointed to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the earl of newport's regiment.[3] service in the royalist cause during the operations on the scottish border in the bishops' wars (1639–1640) he showed his skill and coolness in the dispositions by which he saved the english artillery at the battle of newburn (1640).[3] at the outbreak of the irish rebellion (1641) monck was appointed as colonel of sidney's regiment under the command of james butler, 1st duke of ormonde. all the qualities for which he was noted through life — his talent for making himself indispensable, his imperturbable temper and his impenetrable secrecy — were fully displayed in this post. the governorship of dublin stood vacant, and lord leicester recommended monck.[3] charles i overruled the appointment in favour of lord cavan, and monck relinquished the appointment without ado. the duke of ormonde viewed him with suspicion as one of two officers who refused to take the oath to support the royalist cause in england and sent him under guard to bristol.[3] monck justified himself to charles i in person, and his astute criticisms of the conduct of the irish war impressed the king, who gave him a command in the army brought over from ireland during the civil war.[3] taken prisoner by the parliamentary northern association army under lord fairfax at the battle of nantwich in january 1644, he spent the next two years in the tower of london.[3] during his imprisonment he wrote observations on military and political affairs.[3] career under the commonwealth and protectorate george albemarle, general anglois. d'apres barlow undated french engraving monck's experience in ireland led to his release. he was made major general in the army sent by parliament against irish rebels.[3] making a distinction (like other soldiers of the time) between fighting the irish and taking arms against the king, he accepted the offer and swore loyalty to the parliamentary cause.[3] he made little headway against the irish led by owen roe o'neill and concluded an armistice (called then a "convention") with the rebel leaders upon terms which he knew the parliament would not ratify. the convention was a military expedient to deal with a military necessity. when in february 1649 scotland proclaimed charles, prince of wales, as charles ii, king of scotland, the protestant ulster scots settlers did the same and following charles's lead took the solemn league and covenant.[9] most of monck's army went over to the royalist cause, placing themselves under the command of hugh montgomery, 1st earl of mount alexander.[10] although parliament disavowed the terms of the truce, no blame was attached to monck's recognition of military necessity.[3] he next fought at oliver cromwell's side in scotland at the 1650 battle of dunbar, a resounding roundhead victory.[3] made commander-in-chief in scotland by cromwell, monck completed the subjugation of the country.[3] after his forces stormed the town of dundee, he lost control of his men with the resulting murder and rape of the population.[11] the streets of the town were reputed to run red with blood for days and monck eventually was sickened by the barbarity when he saw the corpse of a suckling mother with her baby still feeding.[12] in february 1652 monck left scotland to recover his broken health at bath, and in november of the same year he became a general at sea in the first anglo-dutch war.[3] on his return to shore monck married anne radford (née clarges).[3] in 1653 he was nominated one of the representatives for devon in barebone's parliament.[13] he returned to scotland, methodically beating down a royalist insurrection in the highlands. at cromwell's request, monck remained in scotland as governor.[3] in 1654, the timely discovery of a plot fomented by robert overton, his second in command, gave monck an excuse for purging his army of all dissident religious elements, then called "enthusiasts", deemed "dangerous" to the cromwell regime.[8] in 1655 monck received a letter from the future charles ii, a copy of which he at once sent to the lord protector oliver cromwell, who is said to have written to monck in 1657: "there be [those] that tell me that there is a certain cunning fellow in scotland called george monck, who is said to lye in wait there to introduce charles stuart; i pray you, use your diligence to apprehend him, and send him up to me." monck's personal relations with cromwell were those of sincere friendship on both sides.[14] restoration of the monarchy portrait of general monck by jacob huysmans. soldier though monck was, he had played the difficult game of politics in a fluid and uncertain situation. that he was victor sine sanguine, i.e., "without blood", as the preamble of his patent of nobility stated, was generally applauded as the greatest service of all, especially after the civil wars.[15] waiting in edinburgh during the confusion which followed oliver cromwell's death on 3 september 1658, monck remained silent and watchful at edinburgh, careful only to secure a hold on his troops. at first he contemplated armed support of richard cromwell, but on realising the young man's incapacity for government, he gave up this idea and renewed his waiting policy.[8] in july 1659 direct and tempting proposals were again made to him by the future charles ii. monck's brother nicholas, a clergyman, brought to him the substance of charles's letter. he bade his brother go back to his books, and refused to entertain any proposal. but when george booth, 1st baron delamer, rose in insurrection in cheshire for charles ii, so tempting did the opportunity seem that he was on the point of joining forces with him and a manifesto was prepared. his habitual caution induced him to wait until the next post from england, and the next post brought news of booth's defeat.[8] march on london when charles fleetwood and general john lambert declared against the parliament, monck not only refused to join them but on 20 october 1659 took measures to actively oppose them. securing his hold on scotland by a small but trusty corps of occupation, he crossed the border with the rest of his army.[3] holding lambert in play without fighting until his army began to melt away for want of pay, monck received the commission of commander-in-chief of the parliamentary forces on 24 november 1659. the navy, some of the english garrisons and the army in ireland declared for the rump parliament (against fleetwood, lambert and the other members of the wallingford house party). monck led his army south from scotland towards london, crossing the river tweed on 2 january 1660. monck's army was inferior in number, but in all other respects superior to lambert's, and monck slowly marched on to london, disbanding or taking over on his way the detachments of lambert's army which he met, and entered the capital on 3 february 1660.[8] general monck as engraved by david loggan, 1661, national portrait gallery, london parliamentary negotiation in london in all this his ultimate purpose remained opaque. at one moment he secretly encouraged the demands of the royalist city of london, at another he urged submission to the existing parliament, then again he refused to swear an oath abjuring the house of stuart and further he hinted to the rump of the long parliament the urgent necessity of a dissolution.[16] monck allowed presbyterian members, "secluded" in pride's purge of 1648, to re-enter parliament on 21 february 1660 while at the same time breaking up, as a matter affecting discipline, the political factions that had formed in his own regiments. he was now master of the situation. the reconstituted long parliament dissolved itself on 16 march 1660 after preparing legislation for a new convention parliament to be summoned.[17] monck was elected member of parliament for both devon and cambridge university in the convention parliament of 1660.[13] monck himself, in communication with charles ii, accepted the latter's declaration of breda of 4 april 1660, which was largely based on monck's recommendations. it offered reconciliation and forgiveness. charles promised a general pardon for crimes committed during the english civil war and the interregnum for all those who recognised charles as the lawful king (except for those who had killed his father); the retention by the current owners of property purchased during the same period; religious toleration; and the payment of pay arrears to members of the army, and that the army would be recommissioned into service under the crown.[18] monck entirely concurred with the disbandment of the new model army, although the regiment of which he was colonel, given the name coldstream guards after his death,[19] survives un-amalgamated to this day.[15] on 1 may the newly convened convention parliament formally invited charles, as king charles ii, to be the english king in what has become known as the restoration.[3][15] commemoration monck's 335-mile (539 km) march from coldstream to london was repeated by travel writer and former coldstream guards officer harry bucknall in 2015 who followed monck's footsteps in aid of injured and homeless servicemen.[20] charles ii's gratitude arms of george monck, 1st duke of albemarle, kg king charles ii rewarded monck suitably for his services in restoring him to his throne. he was made gentleman of the bedchamber,[15] knight of the garter, and master of the horse in the king's household.[3] the king also raised him to the peerage in 1660 as baron monck of potheridge in the county of devon, baron beauchamp of beauchamp in the county of devon, baron of teyes in the county of devon, earl of torrington in the county of devon, and duke of albemarle.[3] he also received an annual pension of £7,000.[15] as a further token of charles ii's gratitude, in 1663 albemarle was named one of eight lords proprietors given title to a huge tract of land in north america which became the province of carolina, the present-day american states of north and south carolina. albemarle sound in north carolina is named after him.[21] the preamble of monck's peerage patent recited his female descent from the beauchamp family, earls of warwick, which family had also held the titles baron beauchamp, baron teyes and anciently the norman comté of aumale, traditionally latinized to "albemarle".[22] although the title earl of warwick was unavailable to him, being then held by the riche family[22] the title duke of albemarle was available and granted to monck.[3] in 1660 monck obtained from the king the extraordinary warrant promising that should his issue fail in the male line his new title duke of albemarle be reverted to his first cousin and colleague in the success of the restoration, john granville, 1st earl of bath. monck's son did indeed die childless in 1688, but no claim was made to the dukedom by the granvilles of the new king, william iii. and in 1697 the king conferred the title, as an earldom, on his favourite arnold joost van keppel.[15] charles ii's promise to monck was fulfilled in france in 1721 when the old pretender king james iii bestowed a supposed dukedom of albemarle onto the 1st earl of bath's nephew, the jacobite george granville, 1st baron lansdowne, who had fled england in 1721.[23] end of career in 1664 monck had charge of the admiralty when james, duke of york, commanded the fleet, and when in 1665 much of the populace deserted london on account of the great plague, monck, with all the readiness of a man accustomed to obey without thinking of risk, remained in charge of the government of the city.[15] at the end of 1665, he was called upon to fight again, being given a joint commission with prince rupert against the dutch in the second anglo-dutch war. the whole burden of the preparations fell upon him. on 23 april 1666 the admirals joined the fleet, and on 1 june 1666 began the great four days' battle, in which monck showed not only all his old coolness and skill, but also a reckless daring which had seemed hitherto foreign to his character. as this recklessness had cost the english many ships, command of the fleet was taken from him and given to rupert, whom he would accompany in the st. james's day battle, the last battle at sea in which he would participate. later in the same year he maintained order in the city of london during the great fire of london.[15] his last service occurred in the raid on the medway of 1667, when the dutch fleet sailed up the thames, and monck, though ill, hurried to chatham to oppose their farther progress.[15] from that time he lived generally privately (although he officially served as first lord of the treasury).[3] death, burial and succession he died of edema on 3 january 1670, "like a roman general with all his officers about him".[15] he is buried in westminster abbey.[15] his titles were inherited by his only son, christopher monck, 2nd duke of albemarle (1653–1688),[3] upon whose death they became extinct.[15] monument in st giles in the wood no monument of any sort exists to the duke in the parish church of merton, in which parish was situated his ancestral estate of potheridge. the church was heavily restored in 1872–1875.[24][25] the road sign on entering the village does proclaim: "merton, birthplace of general george monck". the remaining truncated wing built by him at potheridge survives as a former farmhouse, now used as an adventure holiday centre. some remnants of its grandeur survive inside, including a grand wooden staircase and above on the ceiling three ornate oval plasterwork wreaths framing paintings.[26] heraldic escutcheon of general george monck, 1st duke of albemarle (1608–1670) on external wall above the private doorway to north transept of parish church of st giles-in-the-wood, devon a heraldic stone escutcheon sculpted in relief showing his arms survives on the external wall of the parish church of st giles in the wood, north devon, 3 miles north-east of potheridge, above the private door to the north transept. the arms are as follows:quarterly of 4: 1st: gules, a chevron between three lion's heads erased argent (monck); 2nd: quarterly of 4: 1:royal arms of england (arms of king edward iv); 2 & 3: or a cross gules (de burgh); 4th: barry or and azure, on a chief of the first two pallets between two base esquires of the second over all an inescutcheon argent (mortimer); over-all a baton sinister (arms of arthur plantagenet, 1st viscount lisle (the maternal grandfather of the duke's grandfather anthony monck)) 3rd: barry of six argent and azure in chief three torteaux a label of three points for difference (grey, viscount lisle); 4th: gules, a lion rampant within a bordure engrailed or (talbot, viscount lisle); the whole circumscribed by the garter.[27] the arms of king edward iv when duke of york emphasise his descent from lionel of antwerp, 1st duke of clarence (1338–1368), third son of king edward iii (on which basis the house of york claimed the throne), who married elizabeth de burgh, 4th countess of ulster (1332–1363). their daughter philippa de burgh married edmund mortimer, 3rd earl of march, whose son roger de mortimer, 4th earl of march, was the great-grandfather of king edward iv, whose illegitimate son was arthur plantagenet, 1st viscount lisle, kg, (died 1542), whose daughter frances plantagenet was the wife of thomas monk of potheridge, the duke of albemarle's great-grandfather.[2] critiques of his character as detailed above, monck's skilful and pragmatic political approach inter alia played a crucial role in facilitating a peaceful transition in 1660. his rise attracted its share of critics, some of whom also added criticism of the character of monck's wife. gilbert burnet (1643–1715) in his the history of my own times commented unflatteringly: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} at the king's first coming over, monck and montague were the most considered; they both had the garter. the one was made duke of albemarle, and the other earl of sandwich, and had noble estates given them. monck was ravenous, as well as his wife, who was a mean, contemptible creature. they both asked, and sold all that was within their reach, nothing being denied them for some time, till he became so useless, that little personal regard could be paid him. but the king maintained still the appearances of it; for the appearance of the service he did him was such, that the king thought it fit to treat him with great distinction, even after he saw into him, and despised him. — gilbert burnet.[28] the editor of the 1850 edition of bishop burnet's history of his own time adds a footnote to burnet's comment: if the duke of albemarle's character is estimated from a view of his talents and courage as a commander, either of land or sea forces, he must rank very high in the scale of merit; but if we consider his worth as a statesman or as a private individual, he sinks decidedly to mediocrity. he was at first attached to the royalist cause; then he united with cromwell whilst in the ascendant; and, finally, when the popular feeling again vacillated to the stuarts, he was judiciously active in securing the restoration. it is possible that throughout he was a royalist—in that case he was base and perjured, for he took the covenant; but the most probable conclusion to be drawn from the facts of his life is, that he was willing to be any thing by profession that would best serve his interests. if the characters of him, given by his friends, as well as by his enemies, be compared, they amount to this outline, that he was courageous, cunning, and selfish. he died in 1670. anne, his wife, had been his mistress. aubrey says, that when monck was confined in the tower, his sempstress, nan clarges, a blacksmith's daughter, was kind to him in a double capacity. it must be remembered that he was then in want, and that he was indebted to her for substance. she became pregnant by him, though it is certain that he could not be fascinated either by her beauty or cleanliness. she never could lose the manners of her early life; but when of the highest dignity in the peerage gаvе way to the most violent bursts of rage, and when under their influence poured forth a most eloquent torrent of curse-sprinkled abuse. her husband was unquestionably afraid of her; she was always a royalist, and as he had a high opinion of her mental qualifications, she probably influenced him considerably in the course he adopted. if this is doubtful, it is not at all so that she aided with the utmost care and natural rapacity in obtaining all the rewards she could for his services. — skinner's life of the duke of albemarle — sir p. warwick's memoirs, 408, &c. — continuation of clarendon's life, ii. 25. — burnet's editor's comment.[28] edward hyde, 1st earl of clarendon disparaged monck's part in the restoration in his book history of the rebellion and civil wars in england: the whole machine being so infinitely above his strength that it could only be moved by a divine hand; and it is glory enough to his memory that he was instrumental in bringing those things to pass which he had neither wisdom to forsee, nor courage to attempt, nor understanding to contrive. — clarendon.[29] notes ^ vivian, lt.-col. j.l., (ed.) the visitations of the county of devon: comprising the heralds' visitations of 1531, 1564 & 1620, exeter, 1895, p.568, pedigree of monk

"aubrey tells us that monk learned his trade of soldiering in the low countries, whence he fled after having slain a man. although he frequently went to sea in command of the fleet, he always remained a soldier,and the seamen laughed behind his back when instead of crying 'tack about,' he would say 'wheel to the right or left.' [wheatley then quotes pepys, who had a similar, but less interesting anecdote in an april 4, 1667 diary entry.] " -- chapter 10: public characters, pp. 183-5 (1889 edition; reprinted 1975 by haskell house in new york). except for the backhanded compliment above, wheatley has nothing good to say of monk. wheatley also quotes an oct. 23, 1667 diary entry of pepys': "the blockhead albemarle hath strange luck to be loved, though he be, and every man must know it, the heaviest man in the world, but stout and honest to his country." ✹ david gurliacci on 31 dec 2002 • link monk's marriage gave both the puritans and the victorian historian henry b. wheatley (and me) something to wag tongues about: "monk was fond of low company; both he and his vulgar wife were quite unfit for high -- i cannot say refined -- society, for there was but little refinement at court. ann clarges had been kind to monk when he was a prisoner in the tower, and he married her out of gratitude. she had been previously married to thomas ratford, of whose death no notice was given at the time of the marriage, so that the legitimacy of christopher, afterwards second duke of albemarle, was seriously questioned. aubrey relates a story which cannot well be true, but which proves the general feeling of doubt respecting the point. he says that thomas clarges came on shipboard to tell monk that his sister had had a child. monk cried out, 'what is it?' and on hearing the answer, 'a boy,' he said, 'why, then, she is my wife.'" -- from wheatley's "samuel pepys and the world he lived in," (london, 1889 edition), chapter 10: public characters, pp. 184-185. i have no clue who this aubrey is that wheatley refers to. wheatley notes (p. 185) that in a nov. 4, 1666 diary entry, pepys relates some gossip he heard that monk, when drunk, said it was a "miracle" that his wife, "our dirty bess," should find herself the duchess of albemarle. ✹ david gurliacci on 1 jan 2003 • link historian antonia fraser on monck: "in scotland, where he not only held down but positively governed the scots with his cromwellian army, his rule was both wise and firm. he had not benefited personally from confiscated royalist church land in england and had thus no financial stake in the continuation of the protectorate: monck had been loyal to oliver cromwell. he would have been loyal to richard [cromwell] too, had he considered that the younger protector had any capacity for maintaining within england that law and order which he found so precious." charles ii, in exile, secretly asked monck for help in the summer of 1659, but the cautious general rejected any idea of an immediate uprising in favor of the crown. -- "royal charles: charles ii and the restoration," by antonia fraser, 1980, part ii, chapter 11, pp. 164-5. ✹ lisa grimm on 2 jan 2003 • link "aubrey" is john aubrey (1626-1697), the antiquarian and writer, whose "lives of eminent men" chronicled both truth and hearsay of characters from the elizabethan age up to his own time. although it was not published until 1847, it was well-known within literary circles and often cited by other writers of the period. ✹ david gurliacci on 5 jan 2003 • link more on monck: here's a link to a biographical sketch on monck from david plant's "british civil wars, commonwealth and protectorate 1638-60" website: http://www.skyhook.co.uk/civwar/biog/monck.htm ✹ jonathan finn on 19 jan 2003 • link aubrey's "brief lives" (the usual name for his "lives of eminent men", which lisa grimm mentions) is a wonderful book and surely it and pepys' diary rank as the two great (auto)biographies of 17th century england. aubrey's is a series of mini-biographies of the great characters of the age, from shakespeare to aubrey himself to descartes and everybody in between. it's written in the same gossippy informal style as pepys, and readers of this weblog will surely appreciate it as much as pepys. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/156… ✹ david quidnunc on 4 feb 2003 • link winston churchill, wryly, on monck: "he was a soldier of fortune, caring more for plying his trade than for the causes at stake. [ . . . ] he had steered his way through all the hazardous channels and storms, supporting in turn and at the right moment parliament, the commonwealth, and the protectorate. [ . . . ] he ranged himself from the first against the violence of the army in london. moving with the sentiments of the scottish people, he gained from a convention supplies to maintain his army without causing offence. [ . . . ] "monk was one of those englishmen who understand to perfection the use of time and circumstances. it is a type which has thriven in our island. the english are apt to admire men who do not attempt to dominate events or turn the drift of fate; who wait about doing their duty on a short view from day to day until there is no doubt whether the tide is on the ebb or the flow; and who then, with the appearance of great propriety and complete self-abnegation, with steady, sterling qualities of conduct if not of heart, move slowly, cautiously, forward towards the obvious purpose of the nation. during the autumn of 1659 general monk [ . . . ] was the object of passionate solicitations from every quarter. they told him he had the future of england in his hands, and all appealed for his goodwill. the general received the emissaries of every interest and party in his camp. he listened patiently, as every great englishman should, to all they had to urge, and with that simple honesty of character which we flatter ouselves as a race he kept them all guessing for a long time what he would do." -- "a history of the english speaking peoples: the new world" (1956), book six, chapter 21: the restoration. ✹ roger miller on 11 feb 2003 • link portrait of george monck, 1st duke of albemarle by david loggan from the national portrait gallery http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?se… ✹ pauline on 11 feb 2003 • link " ✹ pauline on 11 feb 2003 • link http://1911encyclopedia.org/m/index.htm sorry, this is the source for the above quotes. ✹ pauline on 18 feb 2003 • link a letter from his excellencie lord general monck, and the officiers under his command, to the parliament (1660) provided by ian maxted, county local studies librarian, exeter central library.

but having suffered a tedious imprisonment for his loyalty, he took the covenant, and entered into the service of the parliament. he signalized himself at the battle of dunbar, where he had a principal share in that important victory. he was afterwards employed by cromwell in reducing scotland, which he did effectually, and had the chief management of affairs in that kingdom. it is well known that he had the greatest hand in the restoration, and that his gallant behaviour on board the fleet, in the dutch war, was almost without example. he is not so well known as an author, though in that character he was not without merit. he had talents both for peace and war; but his capacity was more adapted to the field than the cabinet. his conversation and address were better suited to those scenes of action to which he had been accustomed, than to the drawing-room of charles ii. ob. 3 jan. 1669-70. ---a biographical history of england. j. granger, 1779. ✹ san diego sarah on 25 mar 2016 • link the included wikipedia biography says that the first cousin, 1st earl of bath did not ask to be made 3rd duke of albemarle, so william iii awarded the title elsewhere. however, i would rather trust http://bcw-project.org/biography/sir-john-grenvil… which says that sir john was a second cousin of general monck, and: "sir john grenville, 1st earl of bath was disappointed when william iii granted the earldom of albemarle to a favorite in 1697, a title claimed by bath through his connection to the monck family. sir john grenville, 1st earl of bath's final years were spent in a bitter legal dispute over the albemarle estate, which almost bankrupted him. two weeks after sir john grenville, 1st earl of bath's death in august 1701, his son and heir charles grenville shot himself, apparently overwhelmed by the debts he had inherited. father and son were buried on 22 september 1701 in the family vault at kilkhampton." log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 jan 1 5 9 13 18 20 21 26 30 31 feb 1 3 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 19 20 21 28 29 mar 1 2 3 6 8 9 14 16 19 29 apr 2 11 15 18 27 29 may 3 4 22 25 27 jun 6 20 25 29 aug 21 22 oct 3 10 nov 20 dec 16 1661 jan 2 21 apr 22 23 aug 16 18 1662 sep 3 15 oct 27 nov 10 dec 1 24 1663 mar 26 apr 13 may 15 25 jun 17 jul 15 nov 9 25 dec 28 1664 jan 11 feb 17 22 apr 1 6 jun 9 20 jul 14 23 oct 13 31 nov 14 dec 5 15 1665 jan 27 mar 17 20 27 apr 3 6 7 8 10 12 17 24 28 may 1 3 8 10 14 15 16 18 22 26 28 29 jun 2 8 12 23 30 jul 1 3 10 11 18 20 22 25 aug 8 12 15 19 21 sep 1 6 14 20 23 27 oct 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 13 14 16 18 19 22 25 27 28 nov 5 6 7 12 14 22 26 27 28 dec 4 6 8 9 13 20 22 24 31 1666 jan 3 10 12 16 19 22 25 26 28 29 30 31 feb 6 19 25 26 mar 9 28 apr 13 18 22 23 may 29 31 jun 2 3 4 6 7 10 13 15 19 21 24 29 jul 1 6 12 27 30 31 aug 15 28 sep 7 8 oct 7 8 10 13 15 20 24 29 31 nov 4 dec 19 1667 jan 20 feb 14 25 mar 6 17 22 24 apr 4 26 may 3 16 20 21 22 jun 10 12 14 17 19 jul 2 3 7 22 29 aug 26 sep 16 oct 20 21 22 23 25 28 31 nov 1 4 6 10 17 19 dec 8 21 23 27 1668 jan 2 16 17 28 feb 14 18 mar 6 29 30 may 19 aug 30 oct 13 1669 mar 10 19 1608-1670. 1st duke of albemarle, earl of torrington, baron monck of potheridge, beauchamp and teyes kg. an english soldier and politician and a key figure in the restoration of charles ii. latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
