they tame the perspiration dripping down your face, as well as the sweat that drains down your arms, keeping your hands drier for gripping sports equipment — whether rackets, balls, or barbells. if you’re into lifting, wearing wristbands can limit the amount of chalk you need to use on your hands, as well as give you a surface on which to wipe the moisture which does remain. all that, and yeah, they look super fly too. you know you’ve been waiting for an excuse to rock some sweatbands; now you’ve got one. set includes two wristbands and one headband. 80% cotton/20% elastic terrycloth. emblazoned with embroidered aom get action patch. get yourself some get action sweatbands. related articles never miss an update subscribe to the aom newsletter daily weekly i agree to the privacy policy terms. want to start taking action on the content you read on aom? join the strenuous life learn more never miss an update subscribe to the aom newsletter daily weekly i agree to the privacy policy terms. podcast #596 the mystery, science, and life-changing power of the hot hand podcast #595 everything you need to know about creating a home gym podcast #594 how churchill (and london) survived the blitz of 1940 podcast #593 all you have to do is ask view all related articles/// how i finally made flossing a habit podcast #595: everything you need to know about creating a home gym how to fall asleep in 2 minutes or less podcast #589: how exercise helps us find happiness, hope, connection, and courage view all take action today join the strenuous life the art of manliness copyright © 2020 all rights reserved contact legal about all topics archives we use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website. if you continue to use this site we will assume that you are happy with it.okprivacy policy
