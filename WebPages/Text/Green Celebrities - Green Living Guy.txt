(source: ranker) so this page goes to each one i’ve met or wish to meet! some i have met and the articles linked will show you the connection. if it’s just a post with no connection, i never met em! image for green lighting campaign owned by ets energy store, llc courtesy of courtney dailey photography may lindstrom has been a green celebrity since the first day i met her. has modeled and even movies. now with her own skin care line. adrian grenier is saving plastic straws from starbucks to start! however, he did it to protect the oceans. he added in another quote the following statement. “the ocean must never taken for granted. it has to be nurtured. it gives us so many things, like food, jobs, relaxation, inspiration. but it gives us one thing that we can’t see, but is perhaps the most important of them all – oxygen. 50% of our oxygen comes from the ocean.” bali rodriguez was also recently awarded the green living guy breakthrough model of the year for 2018. boaz frankel – the un road trip brown girl green chelsea sexton charlotte ross is a passionate recognized animal rights activist (widely known for peta “i’d rather go naked…”) campaign. in addition, charlotte is a funny person who i enjoyed interviewing at a prior ema event in los angeles. christian serratos is another peta supporter that i interviewed as well on blog talk radio. as peta mentioned. almost everyone calls himself or herself an “environmentalist.” maybe you recycle, pick up litter, or conserve energy in your home. but did you know that if you want to help the earth, the best thing you can do is to stop eating meat? here’s why: pollution: firstly, can you imagine a city without a sewer system? that’s what factory farms are like. thousands of animals producing thousands of pounds of, well, poop. the poop goes into “lagoons,” which often spill over into lakes and streams. land: as well, on 1 acre of land, you can grow 20,000 pounds of potatoes, or you can grow 165 pounds of beef in the same space. also, about 87 percent of the farmland in the u.s. is used to raise animals for food. water: more noteworthy, more than half of all water used in the u.s. goes to raising animals for food! deforestation: most importantly, everybody’s heard about rain forests and how they’re disappearing. where are they going? they’re being chopped down to make way for grazing land for cows who will be killed for food. energy: producing one fast-food hamburger uses enough fuel to drive a small car 20 miles and enough energy for 17 showers. if you eat hamburgers, you may as well let your faucets. common doctor ginger donna distefano is a green celebrity but also a leading and great fair trade and conflict free jeweler. doctor sylvia earle dr jane goodall ed begley jr. edward james olmos elena lipson eleni tzimas elon musk elizabeth tenhouten environmental media association gabriela volquartz james cameron jon mack leilani munter jessica alba lester brown ted danson being interviewed by seth leitman, the green living guy. let’s not forget ted’s cause oceana ed begley jr did an interview with jenny nigrosh from the green garmento on bitesizetv.com charlotte ross photo from peta campaign stefanie moram good girl gone green suzie essman with seth leitman, the green living guy for catskill mountainkeeper tara mackey tanna fredrick and her cause project save our surf taryn larock tiffany paige – green with tiffany tiffany paige rosario dawson <img src=”https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=4q0di1a8dy00us&#8221; style=”display:none” height=”1″ width=”1″ alt=”” /> share this: share email print whatsapp tweet 2013-01-09 by: greenguruguides on: january 9, 2013 leave a reply cancel reply this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed. meta register log in entries feed comments feed wordpress.org https://greenlivingguy.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/green_recycling_hd.mp4 recent posts living off the grid: 24 items you need so you don’t lose power plastic diets in zero waste cities are the solution to plastic pollution 10 ways to teach your kids how to save energy & money energy efficiency policies could save the u.s. economy almost $1 trillion minit charger unveils revolutionary minit charger archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 december 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 january 2007 november 2006 september 2006 august 2006 june 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 follow me on twittermy tweets follow us twitter twitter designed using unos. powered by powered by wordpress.com. send to email address your name your email address cancel post was not sent - check your email addresses! email check failed, please try again sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.
