to fashion and home movement; come hear from the innovators behind it. some people call eco-fashion green fashion. regardless, it is designed to be environment friendly. green fashion is part of the larger trend of sustainable design where a product is created and produced with consideration to the environment. for allbirds mother nature is our muse. building on her handiwork, we’re finding new uses for materials that exist right in front of us. like wool from merino sheep, who have the best hair in nature. but even great locks need a trim from time to time. with fibers that are 20% the diameter of human hair, our superfine merino wool is breathable, temperature-regulating, and moisture-wicking, all without that irritating scratchiness https://www.allbirds.com here, each brand the green living guy will highlight about green fashion explains how it’s made and the lack of an environmental impact. want to know why you should get green fashion? this is where you’ll get the answers. also my friend gabriela volquartz handles the other reporting on cosmetics that are green. lipstick and wellness. ewg cosmetics landing page: https://www.ewg.org/key-issues/consumer-products/cosmetics healthy living app: for ios and android https://www.ewg.org adalinda fashion beyond the label green living guy awarded taryn hipwell with best green thought leader for 2016 and frankly beyond. her ideas make the products move to pop ups! beyond the label campaign source: sage larock celebrities, models, and designers such as deborah lindquist, edun, marci zaroff, taryn hipwell, prana, stewart+brown, shalom harlow, laura zabo and others have recently drawn attention to socially conscious and environmentally friendly fashion. laura zabo is the new recycled tire queen portland fashion week, which has featured sustainable designers and apparel since 2005, has also attracted international press for its efforts to sustainably produce a fashion week that showcases 100% eco-friendly designs. source: deborah lindquist source: deborah lindquist eco-couture designer deborah lindquist is a bespoke collection of unique eco conscious women’s clothing, accessories, home decorative accessories, wedding gowns and headpieces created from a blend of sustainable, organic, and recycled materials. source: deborah lindquist other sustainable clothing and footwear labels include elena garcia, nancy dee, by stamo, outsider fashion, beyond skin, oliberté, hetty rose, darousso and eva cassis. the sustainable fashion movement has begun to make significant in-roads in the bedding segment of the home fashion category. brands such as boll & branch make all of their products from organic cotton and have been certified by fair trade usa. the hemp trading company is an ethically driven underground clothing label, specialising in environmentally friendly, politically conscious street wear made of hemp, bamboo, organic cotton and other sustainable fabrics. as reported in the associated press: styles in fashion are ephemeral and fickle. those acid-wash jeans, m.c. hammer pants, and dayglo t-shirts you loved in middle school have long since reached “out” status (though the harem pants we saw on the spring 2007 runways look a bit hammer time to us). the skinny jeans you love right now will one day follow their fate. though trends come and go, the clothes themselves stick around. to make room for new fashions, the average american throws away about 68 pounds of clothing and textiles per year. mother earth isn’t that fond of polyester, and is quite warm enough already, thank you very much. on top of that, producing new clothes out of traditionally grown cotton taxes the environment with chemical fertilizers and pesticides; energy and chemicals are required to manufacture synthetic materials. the all-american combo of a cotton t-shirt and a pair of denim jeans, for instance, requires 1 pound of fertilizers and pesticides. but the fashion industry is beginning to recognize its impact, as well as consumers’ desire for more eco-friendly fashion. an increasing number of independent designers and boutiques specialize in eco-conscious fashion that is more hip than hippy. even big companies like h&m, urban outfitters, and uniqlo, which sell really cheap, trendy, and easily disposable clothing (a.k.a. “fast clothes”) are taking steps to be more eco-friendly. one way is by using alternative materials that reduce post-consumer waste and pollution. as taryn hipwell talks about beyond the label: what’s in your t-shirt? consumers have you ever thought about: 1. who makes your clothes? 2. what are they made of? 3. where are they made? 4. why are they so cheap? 5. how are they disposed? laura zabo, queen of recycled tire apparel as her website says: scrap tyres are becoming a huge problem to our planet – they take generations to break down and often end up clogging up landfills. my solution is to repurpose them into high-quality fashion accessories such as beautiful belts, jewellery, dog leads, guitar straps and flip flops. tyre is a fantastic substitute for leather and with a little creativity and imagination there is no limit to what we can make out of scrap tyres. i would love to inspire others to join me in upcycling as much as possible and together we can help make a real difference to the planet, tyre by tyre! all zabo products are 100% sustainable, vegan and eco-friendly, handmade in london. reformation reformation’s green fashion design mission was to make effortless silhouettes that celebrate the feminine figure. the design process starts with us thinking about what we really want to wear right now. we source the most beautiful and sustainable fabrics possible to bring those designs to life quickly. reformation’s design mission is to make effortless silhouettes that celebrate the feminine figure. the design process starts with us thinking about what they really want to wear. most fashion

perfect fit is the most important part of our clothes. reformation spends hours fitting on different bodies and have a meticulous approach to our fits. our main range is fit on multiple women that are
