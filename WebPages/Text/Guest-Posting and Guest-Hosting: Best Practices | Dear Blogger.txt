(i‚Äôm not kidding ‚Äì i know one guy who is working on one right now, and is expected to have it ready sometime in the late winter or early spring of 2014, because his first super-short ebook on this topic just wasn‚Äôt enough, although he wrote a guest post that totally rocked, called how to make guest blogging your most effective traffic strategy). then there‚Äôs jon morrow, an inspiring person who teaches a course on this topic. this just goes to show you how much can be said about guest blogging! given that so many articles have been written about this topic, you may be wondering why i‚Äôm bothering to write another. well, there are a few reasons, actually. first of all, dear blogger is all about helping you and greg doesn‚Äôt have a post about guest posting (he just has his own guidelines) so i thought i‚Äôd help him out. secondly, some of you may not have heard of this concept, may have only dabbled in it, or may want to know more about all it entails. thirdly, there is more to guest posting and guest hosting than you may think, and i want you to be informed so that when you decide to be a guest or a host, you will do so following the best practices possible. finally, i want to bring some awareness to bloggers about these ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù so that the whole overall experience of both guests and hosts is one of mutual satisfaction and serves the audience well. what i‚Äôd really like to do, though, is create a set of rules for all bloggers to follow. üòâ (i‚Äôm winking, but i‚Äôm actually serious. i‚Äôm just wondering if i have to be elected into office or be considered a blogging goddess for this to happen. if any of you know, please tell me asap!) instead, i have compiled a set of ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù to use. why guest post or host? the pros why guest post? why guest host? there are many positive reasons for each. guest posting allows you to: reach a different audience ‚Äì the host‚Äôs. by doing so, the host‚Äôs readers may become interested in the guest and the guest may gain readers of his/her own. create backlinks to your site. most hosts will inform their readers that the post was written by you, for them, and include a short bio at the end of the post with a link to your site. pass your message along to others and/or gain sales or get new clients write in a different way from what you may be used to, thereby helping you develop more skills work with someone else and be part of a team establish your credibility online and help you expand your network. first, however, you need to build trust. ramsay taplin, more famously known as the blog tyrant, made a video that exemplifies this point. guest hosting allows you to: take a vacation or a break from creating new content introduce your audience to someone new, who has a different or fresh perspective be exposed to the guest‚Äôs audience since the guest will likely tell their friends to read the post they wrote for you, thereby increasing your traffic give your readers a treat and mix things up a bit. your guest‚Äôs voice and writing style is generally different from your own. why guest post or host? the cons when guest posting, you may: have trouble finding someone to host you have to spend a lot of time emailing back and forth with the host discover that it is more time-consuming that you think realize that you won‚Äôt get a lot of traffic to your blog as a result become discouraged from guest posting for others if you have a bad experience with it (read one blogger‚Äôs opinions on this subject: is guest blogging all that it‚Äôs cracked up to be?) not know who to approach (but you can find guest blogging opportunities that are a perfect match) when guest hosting, you may: discover that it‚Äôs tough to find guests who can write a quality post spend more time emailing back and forth with the guest than you had wanted to find that your traffic may drop because you‚Äôve featured a guest post and your audience wants only you (which is a compliment, when you think about it!) have to edit the post and then deal with the negative feelings of your guest when you tell them about it (giving constructive criticism is difficult and receiving it is just as hard for some people) have to deal with spammers who pose as someone wanting a guest post position find that the links the guest included are not relevant or helpful to the growth of your website find that the content of the guest post does not meet your expectations guest-i-quette and host-i-quette: best practices when you are a guest on someone‚Äôs website or blog, you should mind your manners and remember that you are a guest. act like a guest. be gracious, nice, friendly, respectable, courteous and helpful. you may be invited back if you and your post perform well! best guest-i-quette practices dictate that the guest will: write the post edit the post provide their own images or include images with proper attribution to the original source submit the post in the format of the host‚Äôs choosing (html code is often preferred) include quality external links relevant to the post‚Äôs topic that will help the host‚Äôs page rank include at least one internal link to the host‚Äôs previously publish posts include a short bio for the host to include at the end of the post avoid linking to his/her own website or blog since a backlink is generally allowed in the guest‚Äôs bio promote the post using social media (and on his/her own blog where applicable) be available on publication day (and a few days afterward) to respond to comments subscribe to comment notifications and reply to comments left for the host in the future best guest-i-quette practices dictate that the host will: provide the guest with a set of clear guidelines to follow double-check all links included by the guest and include the best ones double-check that the post is edited and free of typos ensure that images are relevant and enhance the post ensure that the post is formatted properly will include a short bio of the guest at the end of the post, with a link to the guest‚Äôs website or blog will keep an eye on the comments, moderate where necessary, and delete spam comments will send notifications emails to the guest of new comments promote the post using social media (and on his/her own blog where applicable) summary guest posting and guest hosting involve many factors, but they can both elicit a wonderful experience if executed properly, following the best practices. if you‚Äôve ever guest posted or hosted a guest, i‚Äôd love to hear any stories you may have (even if they‚Äôre horrible!) and if you haven‚Äôt, i‚Äôd like to know if you are now considering doing one or the other ‚Äì or both. share in the comment section (where it says to ask a question) and i‚Äôll be sure to reply to you soon!

thanks for the great information! reply neil january 27, 2016 at 5:23 pm ¬∑ edit i was wondering what your thoughts were on if there is a time that is too early to ask someone to guest post. my blog is only a couple weeks old and only getting like 50 pageviews a day. i feel like asking now would be extremely self serving, but i do want to do it eventually. any thought on when would be a good time to ‚Äúpull the trigger‚Äù? thanks! neil hess reply greg narayan july 5, 2016 at 11:35 pm ¬∑ edit many apologies on the delay here neil. there‚Äôs no perfect time to pull the trigger and i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs self serving at all. on my very first blog honestcollege.com i asked a friend to write in the first month and he said no. he eventually agreed after another month and having two authors made a huge positive impact on the site. it eventually reached about 50 authors. but it‚Äôs really all about whether you want to position yourself as the expert (especially if people want that) or if you‚Äôre trying to create a broader community of authors. both are good. make sure to give their guest posts as much attention (sharing, editing, linking) as yours. there‚Äôs really so much i could write about this great question, ha, but will let you handle the rest. db reply rishab panchal june 26, 2014 at 9:17 am ¬∑ edit i think that the guest post is the most ethical way to get more exposure and get audience for the blog. it has 2 benifit,first is building online reputapion as a wrtter,promotion and traffic for blog and second is backlink as well. so i think we should go on writting guest post.thanks for sharing your views. reply lorraine reguly june 27, 2014 at 4:14 am ¬∑ edit rishab, you‚Äôre right. guest posting is great for those reasons. i‚Äôm glad you enjoyed this post. have you ever guest posted anywhere? reply kevin p stone april 9, 2014 at 2:18 am ¬∑ edit hi, i just want to thank you for your wonderful blog. i have been reading your blog for more than couple of months and now i have learned a lot. it‚Äôs a tough job to keep a blog going and i truly appreciate it. i really like to submit my post on your blog (as guest post) with my website link. please let me know your interest in accepting guest posts for free of cost and i‚Äôm ready to discuss my contents with you, i promise you with quality and 100% plagiarism free content. i am looking forward to get your reply. thank you, kevin p stone reply lorraine reguly june 27, 2014 at 4:15 am ¬∑ edit i‚Äôm assuming you are speaking to greg. i hope he replies! reply neha vasadhani march 29, 2014 at 8:02 am ¬∑ edit dear, my name is neha vasandhani and i`d like to write a guest post for you. i have a team of skilled writers and we are ready to make a research and provide a quality article that will go down well with your readers and give them some useful information. it would be great if you could allow me to place a hyperlink in any part of the article (one link in article). please let me know if you are interested. reply lorraine reguly march 31, 2014 at 2:08 pm ¬∑ edit you want to guest for me or for greg? i‚Äôm unclear on who you are directing your comment at, neha. reply jeevan jacob john january 11, 2014 at 10:19 pm ¬∑ edit one of the mistakes i made in the past is being lenient about my guidelines (well, i had strict guidelines..but often times, i let somethings pass by just to get an article in front of the audience). i truly regret that mistake, but it‚Äôs okay (that mistake is the reason why i now believe in writing for my audience and writing as i like. sure, consistency is important, but don‚Äôt get obsessed by it). as for the other rules, i do agree with them..following the best practices makes guest posting an enjoyable and effective opportunity for both the host and the guest. anyways, thank you for sharing this, lorraine üôÇ appreciate it! reply lorraine reguly january 11, 2014 at 11:10 pm ¬∑ edit jeevan, i appreciate you stopping by and sharing your thoughts. i‚Äôve broken a few of the ‚Äúrules,‚Äù too; i think we all have at some point, but these experiences make us learn what to do and what not to do in the future. as always, the audience remains important in whatever you‚Äôre writing, with the exception of journaling, where anything goes. üòâ reply diana january 10, 2014 at 3:53 am ¬∑ edit super good post ‚Äì well done, lorraine! i second ashley‚Äôs comment that greg has found an invaluable helper here and you are turning to be a better blogger than you give yourself credit for üòâ i think originality of the guest posts is implied ‚Äì when guesting, write specifically for that blog. i hate it when bloggers approach other bloggers with readily written articles, often in bulk ‚Äì without any proper research of the bloggers style, audience or scope of topics. if i may add something ‚Äì for both guests and hosts ‚Äì it would help immensely if you have a plan at hand. sure, guesting is good and can bring you all those pros you listed and may occasionally have those cons you listed, too. but if you have a clear plan and schedule what to do, when to do it, how to do it, etc. ‚Äì then guest posts will have more of the pros and less of the cons. i will open at some point my blog to guest authors and you, lorraine, are on the top of my list of authors who have already approached me! and when i manage to make some time for guesting and make that plan for myself ‚Äì i will certainly shoot you an email üòÄ reply lorraine reguly january 10, 2014 at 9:38 am ¬∑ edit thanks, diana, for your wonderful insight, comment, and consideration! üôÇ you have made my day! it‚Äôs nice to be considered a good choice (i‚Äôm sure greg will be pleased to hear that, too) and to be at the top of a list! i‚Äôm looking forward to that email. üòâ planning is definitely key. thanks for pointing that out. reply samuel january 2, 2014 at 3:52 pm ¬∑ edit i‚Äôve as of recently seen guest posting, not as a traffic technique, but as a way to display your work on a more established blog or website. guest posting isn‚Äôt easy and it shouldn‚Äôt be since it as to be some of your best work! thanks. ‚Äì samuel reply lorraine reguly january 3, 2014 at 1:06 am ¬∑ edit samuel, i completely agree with you! very perceptive observation! reply susan cooper december 27, 2013 at 1:54 pm ¬∑ edit excellent job lorraine. having guidelines well established goes a long way in preventing misunderstandings or extra work for both sides. for me i find that i rarely except a guest post request. partly due to the fact that they haven‚Äôt yet read my rules. once they do, it makes it much easier all around and the process goes much more smoothly. when it comes to images. many times they are of poor quality or haven‚Äôt been vetted with no attribution. when that happens i may reject the post. if the post is well written and high quality, i will inform the blogger that i will provide, create or find images that can be used in the guest post. in the end it is our reputation that we put on the line when we accept or do a guest post, so it behooves us to take care. just my thoughts. üôÇ reply lorraine reguly december 28, 2013 at 3:29 am ¬∑ edit i agree with you, susan, and while i have your attention, i‚Äôm going to use this opportunity to point out one of my personal weaknesses, which i‚Äôm currently improving upon: low quality pictures/images. when i started blogging, i used pics from my camera-phone, which is kinda old, and definitely not great. in fact, i think that one of the reasons my brownies post was not published or accepted by you is due to the poor image quality of the pictures i provided, as i do believe that i followed all other guidelines! if i‚Äôm mistaken, i‚Äôd like for you to set me straight. it is true that we should not sacrifice our integrity for anyone. i am with you one hundred percent on this. if you have any other thoughts, i‚Äôd love to hear them! reply susan cooper december 29, 2013 at 12:46 pm ¬∑ edit it an ever evolving process to know what kind of guidelines one needs, don‚Äôt you think? as far as your brownie post is concerned; as stated in the guidelines, i always test a recipe prior to posting and i usually photograph the results. i‚Äôm usually at least six months out on posts because of the labor intensive nature of my process. because of this, readers have come to trust my recipes. that is the reasons that my food posts are so popular. i had planned to test your recipe in the new year and then find an appropriate place for it to launch. as a side note; i have six others along with my own features that are also in process at the moment. doing a food post is not easy when you do it right, but the rewards a very much worth it. üôÇ reply greg narayan december 29, 2013 at 4:06 pm ¬∑ edit hey susan‚Ä¶ in my opinion, production quality is definitely something that needs to be cooked just right. awesome that you‚Äôre known for long-term prep. i‚Äôve done posts with zero images and posts with lots; seems like relevance is most important, then quality. reply lorraine reguly december 30, 2013 at 7:07 pm ¬∑ edit i read the guidelines and your emails very carefully! i understand that food posts take a lot of time. as it has only been about five months, i didn‚Äôt mean to rush you. sorry. i also understand you are busy. aren‚Äôt we all? üòâ reply susan cooper december 30, 2013 at 7:43 pm ¬∑ edit no worries lorraine. it never hurts to ask. i probably need to add something to the guidelines about length of time. üôÇ reply lorraine reguly december 30, 2013 at 8:57 pm ¬∑ edit you know, that would be really helpful, susan, especially since you ask in each post for people to contact you anytime with a guest post idea. giving people a heads-up will make them realize that things don‚Äôt happen instantaneously! reply suzanne fluhr december 26, 2013 at 5:23 pm ¬∑ edit kudos to both you and greg‚Äîfor practicing what you preach. great guest post. perfect for greg‚Äôs blog. i belong to a closed fb group called ‚Äúboomer travel bloggers‚Äù. i will share your post with them. i had/have a great guest blogging experience with donna hull of my itchy travel feet. she reached out to me to ask if i would be interested in doing a guest post after i left a comment on her blog. i‚Äôve done 3 guest posts for her and i think it has been a positive experience for both of us. i‚Äôm sure she checked out the writing on my blog before she asked if i wanted to guest post. i haven‚Äôt seen that she has had to do any editing of my guest posts, so, imho, she gets quality content from me and in return, she has been a very helpful mentor to me. her blog is a pr 4 and my page rank went up to 3 quite quickly when i started my blog‚Äîprobably at least partly because of the back-links from donna‚Äôs blog. my experience as a guest blog host has not been as spectacular. i‚Äôve had to do heavy editing‚Äìor even total re-writes of guest posts, so i am now very picky. i receive emails offering to provide me with ‚Äúfree‚Äù (or even paid) content in exchange for a link back. if i‚Äôm comfortable with the product or service, i might enter into a commercial relationship, but i do the writing (or expect to heavily edit) myself. reply lorraine reguly december 26, 2013 at 8:35 pm ¬∑ edit suzanne, first and foremost, thank you so much for leaving such a great comment and sharing some of your experiences! also, thanks for sharing this post on facebook. both greg and i appreciate it. üôÇ i think anytime you can get quality backlinks to your blog, you have cause for celebration! i know that, with my ‚Äúfree‚Äù blog, some bloggers have issues with giving me one since it my domain name has wordpress.com in it. however, most people don‚Äôt seem to mind, since i produce quality articles that don‚Äôt have to be edited. (being a freelancer sure helps me in this area!) it‚Äôs too bad that you have had to do so much editing; i know it can be a pain when you are not expecting the extra work. (yes, i can commiserate with you!) i just may have to check out your blog since my curiosity has been piqued. üòâ reply greg narayan december 29, 2013 at 4:08 pm ¬∑ edit thanks for the share!! reply catarina december 25, 2013 at 10:36 am ¬∑ edit personally neither accept guest posts neither write guest posts. but if i change my mind i will take your advice into account, lorraine. reply lorraine reguly december 26, 2013 at 8:36 pm ¬∑ edit thanks for adding to this discussion, catarina. what are your reasons for not accepting (or writing) guest posts? (if you don‚Äôt mind me asking‚Ä¶i‚Äôm curious!) reply abdul rauf december 25, 2013 at 2:54 am ¬∑ edit haha‚Ä¶ host-i-quettes and guest-i-quettes ‚Äì what a creative style of writing! i am also following you on twitter. you‚Äôve an excellent attitude to motivate other fellows like me. i have bookmarked this post for the time i‚Äôll be guest-posting. reply lorraine reguly december 26, 2013 at 8:39 pm ¬∑ edit hey, abdul, you‚Äôve just made my day! thanks for the compliment! i like to be different. üòâ good to hear that you‚Äôre following me, too! greg has a facebook page for dear blogger. not sure if you‚Äôre on facebook, but if you are, i‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd appreciate a ‚Äúlike‚Äù. that way, you won‚Äôt miss out on other great posts of ours! *wink wink* i‚Äôm glad you found this to be helpful! why do you need motivation? reply patricia weber december 24, 2013 at 10:49 am ¬∑ edit first lorraine, thank you for mentioning my blog post for finding the perfect match. one thing to add, maybe in etiquette (could be something else like, standing out from the crowd) include a couple of links to samples of your blog writing on other blogs when you ask a host to consider your writing. it should show how your tailor the work to a particular audience and the quality of the style of your writing. reply lorraine reguly december 26, 2013 at 8:43 pm ¬∑ edit excellent point, patricia. (which is why i‚Äôm so happy that people like you decide to leave comments!) adding to or enhancing the post‚Äôs content is what commenting is all about. proof is everything! another thing i forgot to mention is that, when emailing, the email should be free of errors, too, as should all other correspondence, since when you are writing to someone, you should be demonstrating your skills at all times ‚Äî not just in a guest post but in all other areas as well. wouldn‚Äôt you agree? reply ashley december 24, 2013 at 9:54 am ¬∑ edit awesome job lorraine. great has got the right person helping out with his blog for sure. you are turning out to be more of a pro blogger than you realised! have a great xmas and new year ashley reply lorraine reguly december 26, 2013 at 8:46 pm ¬∑ edit thanks, ashley! i think greg appreciates this comment as much as i do! lol (don‚Äôt you, greg?) i have certainly found one of my ‚Äúcallings‚Äù in blogging. i love it!
