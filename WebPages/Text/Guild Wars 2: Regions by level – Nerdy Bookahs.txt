i have already set foot into a high level area with flummi and she didn’t feel comfortable at all in there. neither did the poor guy in kessex hills with level 16 when he was surrounded by level 24 mobs. sure, you can enter with level 15, but you should be aware of your surroundings as the mobs can be much higher in level than you are in some corners. region explorable zone level range ascalon plains of ashford 1-15 maguuma jungle caledon forest 1-15 maguuma jungle metrica province 1-15 shiverpeak mountains wayfarer foothills 1-15 kryta queensdale 1-17 ascalon diessa plateau 15-25 kryta kessex hills 15-25 maguuma jungle brisban wildlands 15-25 shiverpeaks mountains snowden drifts 15-25 kryta gendarran fields 25-35 shiverpeak mountains lornar’s pass 25-40 ascalon fields of ruin 30-40 kryta harathi hinterlands 35-45 ascalon blazeridge steppes 40-50 shiverpeak mountains dredgehaunt cliffs 40-50 kryta bloodtide coast 45-55 ascalon iron marches 50-60 shiverpeak mountains timberline falls 50-60 maguuma jungle sparkfly fen 55-65 ascalon fireheart rise 60-70 maguuma jungle mount maelstrom 60-70 ruins of orr straits of devastation 70-75 shiverpeak mountains frostgorge sound 70-80 ruins of orr malchor’s leap 75-80 level 80 content (updated february 2019): region explorable zone level ruins of orr cursed shore (accessible to everybody) and siren’s landing (requires the heart of thorns expansion) 80 sea of sorrows southsun cove 80 heart of maguuma (requires the heart of thorns expansion) auric basin, bloodstone fen, dragon’s stand, tangled depths and verdant brink 80 maguuma wastes (requires the heart of thorns expansion) dry top and the silverwastes 80 ring of fire (requires the heart of thorns expansion) draconis mons and ember bay 80 shiverpeak mountains bitterfrost frontier (requires the heart of thorns expansion) and thunderhead peaks (requires the path of fire expansion) 80 kryta (requires the heart of thorns expansion) lake doric 80 crystal desert (requires the path of fire expansion) crystal oasis, desert highlands, domain of istan, domain of kourna, domain of vabbi, elon riverlands, jahai bluffs, sandswept isles and the desolation 80 i have mostly played through the starting areas so far (sylvari and asura) and ran through the human starter area to grab a few waypoints. i really loved skrittsburgh in brisban wildlands, but haven’t seen or been to much other areas there. looking at this list makes me realize how much i have missed already and i am only level 23. there’s definitely enough content to run through the zones again with another alt or two… and then there are dynamic events which means i probably haven’t seen everything anyway. very nice! this game is making me want to explore and do nothing else and it rewards me with everything i need to reach max. level. share this: click to share on twitter (opens in new window) click to share on facebook (opens in new window) click to email this to a friend (opens in new window) click to share on whatsapp (opens in new window) click to share on pocket (opens in new window) more click to share on telegram (opens in new window) click to share on linkedin (opens in new window) click to print (opens in new window) click to share on reddit (opens in new window) click to share on pinterest (opens in new window) click to share on skype (opens in new window) click to share on tumblr (opens in new window) like this: like loading... related categories: game design guides guild wars 2 playstyle published by paeroka view all posts by paeroka tags: guild wars 2, levelling, map, playstyle, pve, regions post navigation previous 5 days with guild wars 2 next bookahneer’s geekwatch: 2 weeks after launch 18 comments rakuno says: 30 aug 2012 at 17:10 thanks for the list! yes, it does seem to have a lot of areas to explore even if you have altitis *coughs*likeme*coughs* so it should keep people busy for a while if they are the explorer types. kahlef is about level 30ish now and he still didn’t complete diessa plateau! granted i’ve been taking a few detours through the newbie zones to get more leather and other crafting materials… likelike reply paeroka says: 30 aug 2012 at 22:37 amazingly, i have sticked with my mesmer all this time. i did create 6 alts, but i have only played them to get out of the tutorial and i played my warrior for a bit (level 5 or so). i am already looking forward to trying out the different classes, though. i think i have only completed metrica province (as in: did all the heart events, vistas, waypoints and pois). i’m behind on tailoring and would love to keep up, but i guess i’ll just let my warror pick up what my mesmer is still missing. ;) likelike reply rakuno says: 30 aug 2012 at 23:57 i am suprised that i’ve been sticking so well to my engineer too and resisting to avoid making more characters (i only have the thief as an alt now). though it can be hard with all the talk in guild chat. i keep getting tempted to make other characters to have fun with other classes too and see the other races personal storylines! :) i’ve completed the newbie charr area and the norn one so far (one day i will remember their names!), including jumping puzzles on both. mostly my fast leveling has been due to trying to keep up with the crafting which has been giving me far more xp than i anticipated. couple it with going to other areas to hunt for materials and i have been leveling much faster than i was planning to. and i am even kinda behind the crafting levels too! likelike reply paeroka says: 31 aug 2012 at 00:06 i have 7 of my 8 character slots occupied. ^^ the 8th is a name safe for now as i’m keeping it to show the game to a friend. after she’s seen the game – and hopefully decided to get it herself… i’d love to play an mmo with her again! – this slot will go to my charr engineer. i have not done any jumping puzzles. i have not found any of them and i haven’t looked for where to find them either. ;) i think i’ll get to that when i’m 80. my goal right now is to get flummi to 30 at which point she’s ready to experience her first dungeon. then i’m going to level up my warrior, paerjja, and maybe… one day… i will decide on which profession i like more. so far, i really can’t decide. likelike reply rakuno says: 31 aug 2012 at 00:29 i’ve pondered about just creating all the characters i want now not just to save the names but also so i could just hop around as the mood hit. but i just like seeing those cinematics of character creation so i am holding off. :) i hear ya about loving to play an mmo again with old friends. some of mine are still not playing it and i am waiting until there is a trial or something so i can convince them to give it at least a try. i would love to see all of us playing the same mmo again and just enjoying our time with it. i found those two jumping puzzles by accident. i saw some uncovered points on my map, got there and found places that looked suspiciously meant for jumping around. so i did it and much to my surprise succeeded! :d my goals now are to play a bit more of my thief, get to the next rank of crafting with kahlef and doing a more of both of their personal storylines. as for professions i don’t know if there is one that i like more. i just like all of them (well, the ones i am intending to create anyway) equally for different reasons. likelike paeroka says: 1 sep 2012 at 08:50 i’ve done it to save the names and, in case we get birthday presents again for our characters, to get those presents as early as possible. i may delete and recreate my human guardian, though. i am not 100% happy with how she looks and i know this will annoy me to no end. ;) i’m waiting until tomorrow, though, because that’s when my own birthday will be and i think it’s cool to have my character’s birthday on mine. yes, i’m silly like that. ;) my charr engineer will also be created tomorrow, after i’ve had a chance to show the game to my friend. i dislike tailoring at the moment. i just can’t seem to get above skill 49. well, i could, if i decided to run through the low level area again, just to get the cloth. but that’s not how i’m playing the game. i do not want to feel forced to do anything. so, i’m just hoping i’m the lucky one that’s allowed to access the trading post any time soon… ;) likelike members all over says: 30 aug 2012 at 23:06 reblogged this on the muses guild:the monger of death. likelike reply pingback: link dead radio « healing the masses archeravatar says: 3 sep 2012 at 04:16 the cartographers site has really come along nicely. thank-you for including that link!

i was finding it difficult to figure out what areas were level appropriate for me, it often involved zooming in and out of the map until i could see that level ranges in different areas, they weren’t all visible at certain levels of zoom. likelike reply paeroka says: 9 sep 2012 at 09:24 you’re welcome! i’m glad it can help others, too. :) and that’s exactly why i wanted a list. the map in the game is nice, but not that helpful when you want to have a fast overview of where you could go now. likelike reply tom johnsen says: 15 dec 2012 at 21:46 thank you likelike reply pingback: where do i go next in guild wars 2? | adventures in a chainmail dress - a gaming blog pingback: snowden drifts in shiverpeak mountains | nerdy bookahs pingback: wayfarer foothills in shiverpeak mountains | nerdy bookahs pingback: 5 years of nerdy bookahs!
