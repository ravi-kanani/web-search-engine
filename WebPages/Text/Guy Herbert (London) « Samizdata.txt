(comments are closed) the human rights act as a constitution of liberty [no, really] guy herbert (london) · civil liberty & regulation · personal views · uk affairs (this is the text of a talk i gave at the adam smith institute last week. more than one person has asked me for it, so i make it available here.) i am here to defend the human rights act. it is not an idealistic defence but a pragmatic defence, rooted in historical context. should classical liberals support the human rights act against repeal? do we need it? my answer is yes. our reactions to phrases become readily conditioned. and so it has been with “human rights”. let us remember for a moment that the full title of the agreement that is under siege here is the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. if it were called the fundamental freedoms act would it be as easy to undermine? sad to say ‘human rights’ do have a bad name, and they have that bad name for good reasons. their strongest proponents often do the most harm to their reputation – not because of the legal content of what they say, but of their approach to the law. this comes in two forms which sometimes overlap: the rarer is soft revolutionism from the far left – human rights as a transitional demand. this approach makes human rights a movement more than a doctrine or legal concept.… a means to control the terms of any political debate. more common is a not entirely conscious belief that human rights and the human rights act in particular embody the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth of how states should treat people. it’s a sort of human-rights fundamentalism, a desire for revealed wisdom in which “but that is contrary to art 6” is a morally conclusive statement. → continue reading: the human rights act as a constitution of liberty [no, really] november 2nd, 2014 | 37 comments -

(comments are closed) social darwinism guy herbert (london) · opinions on liberty · personal views · philosophical if one gets into a discussion of evolution by means of natural selection with politically-minded people, and evolutionary mechanisms in economics and society come up, then those who consider themselves on the left, or ‘caring’, are highly likely—as surely as godwin’s law—to start emphasising that evolution proceeds not only by individual selection, but by group selection. the point intended by this trope is that group selection is how caring collectivity succeeds, and that market, and other pointwise-negotiated, institutions—what with their brutish know-nothing insistence on competition and individual benefit as the measure of all things—are arbitrary, unnecessarily harsh, and retard progress. be careful what you wish for. consider for a moment the social mechanisms we see everywhere that are calculated to the collective advantage of one gene pool over another. they are particularistic institutions with little truck with equality of treatment: the clan; the tribe; religious exclusivity; in-marriage, family honour and sexual repression; suspicion of outsiders; vendetta; genocide. i’ll stick with ‘the tyranny of choice’, thank-you. july 20th, 2014 | 29 comments - (comments are closed) an imaginary emergency guy herbert (london) · civil liberty & regulation · opinions on liberty · privacy & panopticon · uk affairs as the rest of the world becomes more skeptical about mass surveillance, there is one country where it is seldom ever mentioned, except to babble about the need for more of it. the country that the romantic conservative daniel hannan says “invented freedom“: britain. the latest symptom of the “polite and commercial people” of britain’s complacent unconcern with freedom and privacy is emergency legislation to be passed through all parliamentary stages early next week, the data retention and investigatory powers bill or act, as we shall have to call it almost immediately. there is little doubt this will happen. all three major parties are agreed they will drive it through. the “emergency” is a confection. it is ostensibly because of a legal challenge to regulations under an eu directive which was invalidated by the european court of justice – which took place in april. so obviously it has to be dealt with by hurried legislation to be passed without scrutiny and not even adumbrated in public till wednesday. this is the order of events: 8th april – ecj declares data retention directive 2006/24/ec invalid – in theory telcos and isps no longer required to gather certain data …wait for it… 7th july – rumours surface in the press that “something will be done” 9th july – the sun in the afternoon carries a “security beat privacy” piece boosting the scheme as the only way to beat terrorists and paedophiles. 10th july, 8am – emergency cabinet meeting briefs senior ministers. 10th july, 11.18am – bill becomes available on gov.uk website (still not available via parliament), home secretary makes statement in parliament. 11th july (friday), 4pm – draft regulations to be made under the bill as soon as it is enacted made available. 15th july (tuesday) – all house of commons stages of the bill (normally about 4 months). the pretext, reinstating these regulations (which the home office has claimed are still subsisting in the uk anyway) is hard to accept as “vital”. other countries manage fine without them, and they only existed at all because of some bullying by the uk of other eu states after the 7th july 2005 bombings. i covered this background in an article for city am written on thursday. but since then we have had a chance to read what is proposed. reinstating the regulations – or anchoring them against legal challenge, since they are still operating – would be simple. the new bill need only say that parliament enacts the content of the regulations as primary act of the uk parliament. i wouldn’t be pleased. but it would be doing what was required by the ostensible emergency. that however is not what is happening. the new bill would broaden the regulations and the scope of the regulation of investigatory powers act under which most state snooping in britain is conducted and give the home secretary powers radically to expand the data required, by further regulations. it is a move in the direction of the supercharged surveillance regime set out in the communications data bill, which was dropped as too controversial ante-snowden. the clearest detailed analysis is by david allen green in the ft, he says: the removals of civil liberties, and the encroachments of the state, are rarely sudden and dramatic. it is often a subtle change of legal form here, and the deft widening of legal definitions there. and before one knows it, the overall legal regime has changed to the advantage of officials and the otherwise powerful, and all we have done is nod-along as it happens. i fear it is worse than that. politicians and press have been so comprehensively suckered that some who would normally stand up for civil liberties are burbling about how “it offers [the] chance to bring rise of surveillance state under democratic control”. drip. the liberal democrat politicians who have been most reliable n this topic all appear to have been bought off with a sunset clause and the ludicrous promise of “a review”, even though they have now had several years of experience of arrant avoidance of their questions by the intelligence services. drip even this cannot persuade them that the security state (sometimes called the “deep state”, though that flatters its dysfunctional smugness) is mocking them. drip. our permanent establishment in whitehall treats ministers with condescension, and mere parliamentarians with the same contempt it reserves for ordinary citizens. but those in public life need to believe the state is their honest servant. drips! july 13th, 2014 | 22 comments -
