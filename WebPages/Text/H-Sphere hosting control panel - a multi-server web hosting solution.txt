other servers can be installed later. you need more than one box if you are going to offer one of the following: 1) windows hosting: windows web, ms sql, ms exchange, and windows realmedia servers are set up separately on windows 2000/2003 platform and can also be combined in any possible way. 2) pgsql database hosting: pgsql server for user database hosting can't share the box with the control panel server, because the latter runs with system pgsql database. 3) vps hosting: virtual private servers require special software that is installed on a separate linux box. h-sphere requirements h-sphere can be installed on any number of computers. a minimum configuration can be installed on one box, but more is recommended. hardware if you are going to install h-sphere to only one computer, make sure it is at least pentium iii, 500mhz cpu and 512mb ram. this will allow to host only a small number of customers. adding sitestudio will require at least 1000mhz cpu and 1gb ram. other requirements positive software recommends processing credit cards payment solutions: - full control of dns, mail, web and other hosting servers is a must while installation and testing. - h-sphere can be installed only on public ips. - to provide domain registration services with opensrs, you will need a full access account. to get it, contact opensrs tech support, and tell them you will be using h-sphere. they will waive the requirements for the full test. to accept credit cards in real-time, you will need an account and gateway access through one of the supported merchant gateways. see also how to prepare servers for the h-sphere installation on *nix on windows h-sphere assured security h-sphere ensures data and transaction security at all levels, including: - site performance under site owner (both unix and windows); - ssl / shared ssl certificate support for individual domains; - ssl encryption for the entire control panel; - server-side encryption of credit card numbers. however, we find it important to emphasize that the security of the server at the lowest level must be provided by the system administrator. tips on how to increase h-sphere security are available here (courtesy of dynamic netâ„¢). see also latest features roadmap h-sphere sse psoft price list rss buy h-sphere from datacenter resell merchant accounts, get 20% of the revenue home products documentation forum support partners contact us . positive software corporation. all rights reserved.
