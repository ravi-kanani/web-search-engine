hard water is water with a high mineral content, usually calcium and magnesium. soft water is the term we give to water that has a low to normal mineral content. it‚Äôs said that drinking hard water can be slightly better for you but it‚Äôs not any better for your hair and it can be quite damaging. how do i know if i have hard water? if you live in the us you can google it and there are details for each area. but there‚Äôs an easy way to check at your home ‚Äì look at your bathroom and if you have any evidence of limescale around your tap or shower head then you probably have hard water. in australia, we‚Äôre quite lucky and tend to have soft water in metropolitan areas. if you‚Äôre in a regional area, you might have hard water or bore water. in england you tend to have hard water in the midlands and south and softer water in the north. across europe, the water is harder in most areas with small pockets of soft water. at home test for hard water here‚Äôs another way you can test if you have hard water at home. take a little bit of water and put in some shampoo (or just soap) and give it a good stir. you want to see how much foam builds up. if you have soft water, you‚Äôll get a lot of froth and foam but in hard water it‚Äôs very difficult to get soap to lather. what does hard water do to your hair? hard water opens up the cuticle of your hair and can cause your hair to feel rough and get tangled more easily. it also leaves more mineral deposits in your hair which can leave your hair feeling dry and knotty. what to do if you have hard water? if you live in a house you can have a water softener installed. our friends in the uk have this and when i‚Äôm staying with them my hair is so much better than the rest of the uk. alternatively, if you can‚Äôt change your water system you can get a shower filter head. these shower filters makes a huge difference and you can just replace the filter as needed to keep making sure that your water is clean as it hits your hair. any water will damage your hair?! regardless of what sort of water you have, did you know that water itself is damaging your hair? water swells the hair shaft and causes the cuticle to expand. and if you leave your hair wet for a very long period of time it can cause stresses in the hair shaft and that‚Äôs one way you get split ends. so if your hair takes a very long time to dry, it‚Äôs less damaging to blowdry your hair on medium heat than it is to leave your hair wet. strange i know but there are tests on this. how to repair hair that‚Äôs been damage by hard water there are special shampoos called chelating shampoos. these particular clarifying shampoos bind to the minerals and strip them out of your hair. chelating shampoos are very strong cleaners and you should only use them once a month, but i do recommend them if you live in a hard water area to remove any mineral deposits from your hair. i also recommend a regular clarifying or detox shampoo once a week / once a fortnight depending on how often you‚Äôre washing your hair. here are some products that i recommend: chelating shampoos: joico k pak hairprint clarifying shampoos: o&m original detox ouidad shower head filter: t3 filter now with your new shower & shampoo routine, and a moisturising hair mask, your hair will be feeling better than ever. if you‚Äôve got any more questions about hard or soft water and how water affects your hair, let me know in the comments below and make sure you subscribe to my youtube channel here so you‚Äôre the first to see my next video. you may also like... how to maintain your hair colour what is co-washing?

i actually have never used one on my hair before for fear of leaving it limp and greasy (as some regular conditioners do to my hair). thanks in advance for your suggestions! i look forward to checking out more tips and tricks so i can try them on my own hair! üôÇ reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed. hair romance ‚Äì love your hair hi, i'm christina and welcome to hair romance. here you‚Äôll find tutorials, tips and beauty advice to help you to love your best accessory: your hair. find out more here... search hair romance shop hair romance learn how to braid your own hair, style your curls and have new hairstyles every day with hair romance's ebooks. archives archives select month march 2020 january 2020 december 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 shopbop.com fast free shipping worldwide just arrived shop other shop heeled boots fast free shipping worldwide just arrived ganni shop ganni printed mesh top honeydew intimates get the look calvin klein underwear heart calvin klein underwear ultimate cotton ... < > shop other ray-ban heart ray-ban camouflage wayfarer sunglasses ray-ban heart ray-ban foldable clubmaster sunglasses < > shop heeled boots frye frye vera strappy boots frye buy vera slouch boots from frye jeffrey campbell france wrap strap boots by jeffrey campbell < > shop fashion jewelry, heeled sandals, red bikinis tops, dress pumps and more. get this widget. hair romance all information copyright hair romance‚Ñ¢ 2010-2020. hair romance is a registered trademark. quick links home about 30 days of curly hairstyles 30 hairstyles in 30 days 30 braids in 30 days 30 buns in 30 days advertise contact contact email: thehair[at]hairromance[dot]com mail: po box 1288, darlinghurst nsw 1300 twitter: @hairromance instagram: @hairromance copyright christina butcher 2020
