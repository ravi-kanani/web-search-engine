style design food travel relationships motherhood shop menu style design food travel relationships motherhood shop have you seen these rainbows? by joanna goddard have you spotted any rainbows in windows where you live? here’s a look around brooklyn… how sweet is this way to stay connected while being isolated? here’s a map of the rainbow connection! my friend linsey laidlaw and her kids took it to the next level and made a rainbow for their entire building! (her brother lives upstairs and taped up those pieces.) “one of the best things about brooklyn is in both times of crisis as well as regular life, there is an unspoken vibe that we’re in this together with our neighbors,” linsey pointed out. “this project reminds us that our neighbors aren’t gone, they’re just on the other side of their rainbows — collaborating not just on art but on keeping each other safe.” here are photos of their process, below. how sweet is that? have you seen rainbows around? or felt any other moments of connection? xoxo p.s. a small kindness i’ll never forget, and 11 reader comments on kindness.

sally march 27, 2020 4:17pm / reply katelyn says... that’s precious! here in sacramento our little neighborhood association has been doing “window scavenger hunts” for the kids. by that i mean they’ve asked everyone to put a shamrock, or a heart, or flower in their window depending on the day, much like these rainbows, and then parents can walk their kids around and see how many they find! anyway, sending our best from the west xo march 27, 2020 3:18pm / reply maggie says... rainbows everywhere in madison, wi! march 27, 2020 1:11pm / reply amber says... yay!! yes, i can second that there are so many in madison! ❤️ march 27, 2020 3:39pm / margot says... here in the fraser valley of bc, lots of people are putting hearts in their windows, rainbows too. i have been spotting them on my runs, and have been brought to tears more than once, overwhelmed by the feeling of “we’re all in this together/look for the helpers/we will get through this”. be well, xo :) march 27, 2020 12:36pm / reply jen says... #aworldofhearts facebook group has a movement to put hearts in windows to show we are all in this together :) march 27, 2020 12:15pm / reply sarah says... we have one in sf! march 27, 2020 12:07pm / reply sarah says... i just saw one in the inner richmond where i live…is that where you saw it, sarah? march 27, 2020 4:47pm / abigail thompson says... we’ve got them in philly too! i know it started for kiddos, but it really raises my spirits when i go out for a walk! march 27, 2020 11:48am / reply lindyo says... oh, how i love this! just outside of boston in a downtown area. posted a rainbow and a bow-tied teddy bear on the widow this morning. cannot wait to see more when i go on my walk. is mid-50’s too old to go on a teddy bear hunt? i think not. p.s. also the berklee ensemble helped me get my groove back. march 27, 2020 11:30am / reply cymbidy says... montreal quebec — all over our neighbourhood too! often with the french hashtag “ca va bien aller” — it’s going to be ok. :) march 27, 2020 11:21am / reply hm says... our neighborhood has been full of pictures in the windows! i get a little emotional that many neighbors without children are participating as well–we’re all just trying to make one another smile through this weird time! my 5-year-old got a sun catcher kit as a present, and we just made them over the weekend–they were so fun to make! the kit came with about 10 of them, so we took a walk and left a few on doorsteps or windows of friends’ houses (then texted to let them know where the presents came from). within 24 hours we had so many little craft “gifts” from our neighbor buddies on our doorstep (which i lysol’d within an inch of their lives). highly recommend! march 27, 2020 11:18am / reply holly says... teddy bears here in the windows in charlotte, north carolina! sending love to everyone, we’re all in this together <3 march 27, 2020 10:38am / reply emily says... yes! not in the windows, but chalked on a back patio of neighbors in a building next door. it made me smile. march 27, 2020 10:37am / reply kelli says... i’ve been thinking about getting to christmas lights back out. march 27, 2020 10:15am / reply meg says... love that. march 27, 2020 1:28pm / martha l. says... i did that this weekend and it brings me such joy. we have a hospice/rehab center at the end of our block and i hope it brings the staff as much joy as it does me. march 27, 2020 3:32pm / kay says... this is huge in montreal now, couple with the caption “ca va bien aller” (it’ll be okay). it’s been slowly spreading throughout ottawa and i love seeing it in windows when i take my kids out for neighbourhood walks– shows we’re all in this together! march 27, 2020 9:39am / reply joanna goddard says... that’s beautiful! march 27, 2020 10:00am / rachel says... my neighborhood andersonville, in chicago, is doing something similar! we switch what goes in the window every week – shamrocks, then dinosaurs, then hearts, etc. – and plot participating homes on a google map! i know it’s meant for kids but adults love it, too. :) march 27, 2020 9:20am / reply jessie says... woah wait, i live in andersonville in chicago (!!) and have been trying to figure out what has been going on with the windows, because they make me so happy and i would love to join in! i am loving the cranes in the trees as well (hanging on the street near women and children first) and all the chalk messages (like “you are loved”). i don’t want to be creepy, but would love to somehow connect. not sure how to do that. thank you for making our neighborhood a brighter and better place! march 27, 2020 11:10am / nectar says... i was raised in andersonville. would love to see this! march 27, 2020 12:01pm / emily says... hello from rogers park! my neighbors and i will be decorating the windows of our six flat this weekend in solidarity. sending good vibes your way, fellow northsiders! xx march 27, 2020 12:56pm / emma says... this is wonderful!! starting to see these in my vermont town and will be adding one to my window today! i’m a musician and work with kids, and i wrote them the ‘rainbow parade’ song last year, because oh the joy of ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 rainbows! it warms my heart to think of families on a rainbow parade each day!! thanks for sharing! march 27, 2020 9:04am / reply helga thomsen says... in my neighborhood in los angeles, children draw rainbows and write sweet messages in chalk on the sidewalks in front of their homes and apartments. they make me smile or cry or both. march 27, 2020 8:58am / reply talia says... our very small town is doing a ‘bear hunt’ for children. people are putting stuffed animals in window or placing them on their front porches for kids to find. rather like a scavenger hunt. it warms my heart to see everyone participating trying to infuse a bit of joy in this anxiety filled time. sidewalk art is also being made and always brings a smile to my face when walking around town. silver linings…. march 27, 2020 8:34am / reply joanna goddard says... so cute :) march 27, 2020 10:01am / claudia says... here lisbon – portugal: yes, i’ve spotted some, and there is a big one on a building in my neighbourhood. stay safe!

“but as i look up and see several hand-drawn rainbow flags hanging from my neighbours’ windows with the expression “andrà tutto bene” (everything will be alright), i’m reminded that we will get through this and that things will get better.” http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200325-italys-inspiring-response-to-the-coronavirus sending love and clean-hands-blowing-kisses from london! march 27, 2020 5:57am / reply kayleigh says... last night in the u.k we all went to our windows and doors and clapped for our carers. it was beautiful, you could hear it for miles! such a great reminder of how we’re in this together and of how deserving the nhs and all of the carers in the country are of recognition. i cried the whole way through and i’m tearing up as i write this again! march 27, 2020 5:13am / reply joanna goddard says... love that so much. march 27, 2020 10:01am / genevieve martin says... i couldn’t believe how loud and how many people joined in! i’m in bristol but friends in small towns all over the country heard it too. so moving, really did make you realise everyone is in the same boat! march 27, 2020 11:15am / piper says... we’ve been self-quarantined and homeschooling for 3 weeks now in seattle, and feeling incredibly blessed to have a roof over our head. today we were drawing about something that makes us happy, and my 5 year old immediately started drawing a rainbow. my 10 year has also been practicing the song rainbow on the piano, and we recorded it for the first time today. sharing it with you all, because we can all use a little rainbow in our lives right now, to help us remember to be kind to ourselves, and that together, we will get through this hard and scary time together. thankful for this virtual community. https://vimeo.com/401058438 march 27, 2020 5:02am / reply marit says... we feel you! we think of you! we wish you all a good health! thoughts and greetings from germany march 27, 2020 4:29am / reply hanna merkley says... little gems of happiness and hope! we live in dublin right now and rainbows are in windows here (and i know rainbows are up in toronto too as lots of friends have posted pictures of our old street). also, wendy macnaughton is doing a great instragram art lesson series, “draw together”. she’s on live every day at 10am and her lessons are up for 24 hours. one of her first lessons was about rainbows! wishing everyone happy thoughts today! x march 27, 2020 4:01am / reply catarina says... we’re in sydney and have put up rainbows today! it feels good to be doing something positive and uplifting! 🌈🌈🌈 march 27, 2020 3:48am / reply elisa taelman says... in belgium, we started a game, inspired on a kids book: people place teddy bears behind their windows, so kids can go ‘bear hunting’. we walk around the neighbourhood and try spotting as many bears as possible. my 3 and 5 year old daughters love it, it makes their day if they spot winnie the poe! march 27, 2020 3:21am / reply claire says... i’ve loved all the positivity emerging lately; it really has lifted my spirits. last week, i was thinking about the brilliant efforts in spain and italy, particularly the clapping for health and sanitation workers each evening. today i read this article by a doctor–pleading for visible supports, rather than social trends like clapping–and it’s sat heavily with me. i began to wonder what more i could be doing. does anyone have ideas on how to balance the bits of levity with tangible supports? https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/opinion/coronavirus-doctors-hoarding.html march 27, 2020 2:13am / reply genevieve martin says... where are you claire? here in the uk there is a national volunteer drive called goodsam where people can volunteer to deliver food to isolated people, act as patient or medicine transport for nhs or call isolated people for a chat (so anyone can do the last one even if isolating themselves). also local councils have set up volunteer lists. even my housing estate organised a list of volunteers to do errands and shopping for people who needed it. i’m sure there’s something similar wherever you are! march 27, 2020 11:19am / karen says... the thing i keep thinking of is companies or people who are able, making gowns and masks or organizing ppe drives. a small shoe company here in washington and a sewing/textile organization making masks, mlb/fanatics making gowns in the northeast, christian siriano using his company to make masks. distilleries here in wa finding ways to make hand sanitizer with their alcohol. i don’t have machines or know how to do that but if anyone knows anybody who does, writing/calling/encouraging/them to do so. i know it’s a huge logistical challenge but if there are companies large or small that can convert to make some kind of ppe, or encourage anyone with masks, sanitizer, gloves or gowns to donate them (here, they can take them from the trunk of your car during certain hours.) that is step one? it is so, so hard to feel this helpless. march 27, 2020 11:33am / jen says... my kids and i painted rainbows and taped them all over our door to “lure leprechauns” to our home for st. paddy’s. i haven’t taken them down yet because they’re so cheery, i guess we’re a part of something bigger than i realized :) march 27, 2020 2:07am / reply abby says... my 6-year-old daughter and i have been doing wendy mcnaughton’s daily art class on instagram (best thing ever, for both of us), and one of the day’s activities was drawing a rainbow to post in the window! so maybe this is where at least some of them come from? march 27, 2020 12:40am / reply kate says... this is so wonderful. i moved to the suburbs last year and am feeling such a lack of community and togetherness that i felt and saw when living in nyc/boston. i miss having my “people,” even if that is just someone i passed on the street regularly. i’m a healthcare provider, too, and have quarantined myself completely outside of work, so the stress coupled with loneliness has been difficult. this brought me some bittersweet joy. thank you. march 26, 2020 11:49pm / reply julia says... i live in northern bc canada and everyone here has been putting hearts in their windows. it’s been a wonderful activity to walk around with my kids looking for all the hearts. it also makes me feel less alone during this odd and unsettling time. march 26, 2020 11:38pm / reply beth says... people around my neighborhood places teddy bears in their windows. now when we are out in walks with the kids we can “go in a bear hunt”- just like the preschool song! super cute way to feel connected. march 26, 2020 11:26pm / reply nn says... crying. this is beautiful. march 26, 2020 11:14pm / reply alice says... ah! i just noticed all the rainbows on a walk just now – in melbourne, australia. we really are all in this together, take care! march 26, 2020 9:29pm / reply b says... we just put a tissue paper rainbow up in our bay window today! it was wonderful. we listened to songs about rainbows while we put it up. we’ve been writing chalk poetry on our street too. i love the inspiration to find creative ways to stay connected. march 26, 2020 9:20pm / reply jm says... we live in cobble hill and this has been so amazing for our 4 year old. she loves stopping by friends’ houses to see the rainbows even though we can’t play with them. we might have gotten too excited and have 5 rainbows in our windows now. :) love our community in brooklyn. march 26, 2020 9:08pm / reply joanna goddard says... <3 march 27, 2020 10:02am / judy says... we’re home schooling now in sydney and i taught a science units on rainbows to my son this morning!! he’s so excited to put a rainbow outside our place now- 😄 going viral with rainbows is something i can really get behind🌈- thanks everyone!! march 26, 2020 8:45pm / reply jules says... our sidewalks here have soo many notes from all the stuck-at-home kids. i love walking around and reading them! march 26, 2020 8:41pm / reply abie says... i live in wisconsin and it’s the same here! i enjoy adding some hopscotch to my daily walks:) march 26, 2020 10:02pm / ashley says... in our neighborhood in dc we pick a different item each week (first four leaf clover and now rain is) to put in the window. it’s very heartwarming to see on our short walks. march 26, 2020 8:32pm / reply ashley says... *rainbows march 27, 2020 7:40am / amy ks says... i live in charlestown, a neighborhood in boston and we put a rainbow across our windows yesterday. you can see mine on instagram at aks07. the week before we put up shamrocks as the local neighborhood students were doing shamrock hunts. i love this so much and will probably add flowers to my windows next week. i love that this is happening everywhere. it brings a smile to my face. march 26, 2020 8:25pm / reply teddy nykiel says... lot of rainbows in milwaukee… in windows and in chalk drawings around the neighborhood! march 26, 2020 8:13pm / reply sarz says... i haven’t noticed any rainbows in my path between home and work here in ottawa, but i’ll be paying closer attention now. we *do* have a city-wide balcony standing ovation for essential workers on wednesdays. :) march 26, 2020 7:56pm / reply julie says... my good friend robin started a group in philly that is doing something similar, but with themes each week. this week’s is space, it’s been lovely. https://6abc.com/community-events/one-philly-art-group-brings-thousands-together-online-during-coronavirus-outbreak/6053091/ march 26, 2020 7:43pm / reply danielle says... this is great!! in san francisco, we are getting a lot of rain-created rainbows, and it is so, so comforting. march 26, 2020 7:42pm / reply j ray says... here in ct, several towns are ringing bells every night at 8pm. it’s been great to hear neighbors you can’t even see, and the kids love it. march 26, 2020 7:39pm / reply marie says... rainbows and teddy bears both in the windows here in des moines, ia. we love the sentiment of “we’re going on a bear hunt” kids’ book – “we can’t go over it, we can’t go under it, we’ve got to go through it” – together. love to all! march 26, 2020 7:35pm / reply kylee says... this is my three year old daughter’s favorite book right now and it is so so fitting. march 26, 2020 11:25pm / katherine says... yes! just took a solo walk around my toronto neighbourhood and spotted a sidewalk-chalk rainbow with the inscriptions “love” and “smile.” it did make me smile! march 26, 2020 7:34pm / reply jo says... i’m in toronto too and now inspired to put up a rainbow too! march 27, 2020 12:24am / maeve says... i’m also in toronto and planning to put up a rainbow this weekend. this post made me feel more connected. march 27, 2020 11:20am / kirsten says... chicago has rainbows too! our kids have thoroughly enjoyed going on “rainbow hunts” to pass the time. march 26, 2020 7:26pm / reply katie says... i put a rainbow in our window. we live on a busy street that gets a lot of foot traffic. it was so therapeutic to make the rainbow! i used tissue paper and contact paper. march 26, 2020 7:09pm / reply emily says... portland, oregon implemented treasure hunt tuesdays in which kids draw and put a shape in a window of their home. the theme changes weekly (e.g., shamrocks, umbrellas, flowers). then, kids go for walks and see how many shapes they can spot for that week. march 26, 2020 6:43pm / reply elise says... we have stuffed bears in the windows here in seattle! march 26, 2020 6:29pm / reply sarah says... rainbows in montreal too! my two year old helped me make one. it doesn’t look much like a rainbow, but she’s so proud to see it in the window. march 26, 2020 6:26pm / reply anna says... hey, i’m in montreal too :) my six year old made a rainbow, and my two year old scribbled each colour of the rainbow on a piece of paper, and we hung both :) we’re in ndg. march 26, 2020 8:11pm / cymbidy says... also in ndg! we put ours up today. march 27, 2020 2:41pm / ingrid says... my son’s sixth birthday was last week. with his party cancelled, we delivered pokemon inspired craft supplies to his friends. what we didn’t expect, was for his friends to create pokemon to hide through the neighborhood. for the past week, we have all been exchanging videos as we find the pokemon hiding in our neighborhood. this has been a wonderful way to connect with his friends, and generate cheer amongst a group of children, making it an extremely memorable and positive birthday celebration. march 26, 2020 6:13pm / reply jill says... we need pics of this, stat! or video! what an awesome approach to catching ‘em all 😍 march 27, 2020 1:21am / sarah says... rainbows in montreal too! march 26, 2020 6:11pm / reply kelli says... oakland here! we made a huge rainbow for our front window, and today my daughter was so excited to see a few in a couple of windows. i thought to myself that i need to get the word out to a wider audience to get more people involved – so i’m going to post on nextdoor. march 26, 2020 6:10pm / reply kara says... i took a drive to no where last weekend just to get out for a while and i saw so many kids drawings of rainbows. my husband and i do not have children, but i was thinking of making my own to hang in our window. march 26, 2020 5:53pm / reply mimi says... i love all of this! i hadn’t heard of it or seen it, but it is such a lovely idea – and such a fun thing to do with the kids while at home. thank you so much for sharing. march 26, 2020 5:50pm / reply nm says... my 11 year old daughter just posted a picture she drew with a rainbow!! she has been worried about the elderly and everyone who is isolated and lonely so she started an instagram (@coronakindnessnow) to share her art and uplifting quotes. please take a look if you need some sunshine in your day: https://www.instagram.com/coronakindnessnow/ thank you joanna for bringing light and hope to today!🌈☀️ march 26, 2020 5:44pm / reply aly says... is there a link to the google map of rainbows? we tried to find some in park slope today but didn’t see as many as this map suggests there may be nearby! march 26, 2020 5:43pm / reply joanna goddard says... my friend linsey made it! march 26, 2020 6:35pm / alex says... there is an interactive google map. you can add your own rainbow. https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1ywaqvlt8npzqrl8s79oih0o_l6asv0tx&ll=40.68030458118457%2c-73.99962946889917&z=15 march 26, 2020 8:03pm / alexis says... hi aly – try this: https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1ywaqvlt8npzqrl8s79oih0o_l6asv0tx&ll=40.67456548191182%2c-73.9445403640542&z=11&client=safari it’s not perfect – i couldn’t figure out how to add myself to it – but it’s got a lot. good luck and stay safe! march 26, 2020 9:24pm / samantha says... how can i add to the map? march 27, 2020 8:47am / shelley says... plymouth mi here! rainbows everywhere!! march 26, 2020 5:41pm / reply joanna goddard says... love!!! march 26, 2020 5:41pm / shelley says... also did shamrocks so children could take a walk with their families and count them on st patrick’s day and i’m sure we will do something for easter as well! :) march 27, 2020 8:55am / virginia says... our neighborhood had the kids draw easter eggs and put them in the windows. the kids love going on walks around the neighborhood counting the eggs, since they won’t be able to do any hunt this year! it’s very sweet. we’ve also been encouraged to put our christmas lights back out, which we have done. it has really brightened everyone’s spirits! march 26, 2020 5:33pm / reply laura says... we have 4 leaf clovers here in az! march 26, 2020 6:05pm / elle says... we just put up our rainbows in our window too in southern california! and we also have a bear greeting our neighbors :) it’s been a sweet way to connect with our neighborhood while practicing social distancing ;) march 26, 2020 5:25pm / reply aa says... jo – while not related to the rainbows post, was wondering if you were planning on having another finance post soon? i just saw one on nymag and thought it was a great idea – and i’ve always enjoyed the ask paco column. while the nymag one is already pretty informative (link if anyone is interested: https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/what-should-we-be-doing-with-our-money-right-now.html) i thought there could be so many interesting ways you guys could address this differently as well – whether for job-seekers, how those who are more secure can help others that aren’t (maybe even on a “blog community” level – ie highlighting readers who have small businesses that could use some help, etc), or something else. even for those that are fortunate enough to have near-term job stability and/or have a decent nest egg, it would be helpful to have a view around how we should be planning for, say, the next 6-12 months. march 26, 2020 5:19pm / reply joanna goddard says... that’s a great idea, thank you! march 26, 2020 5:22pm / joaquina says... yikes you are really asking this of jo? do people not realize how unrealistic it is for her to tackle all these myriad requests (“can you please address aging/buying a house/raising teens/mental health…” and now finances!). no disrespect or snark, truly, but perhaps there are already articles out there by actual financial experts to better help your query. march 26, 2020 7:50pm / aa says... hi joaquina, thanks for your response. unfortunately your response did come across a bit snarky. as i mentioned in my post, i mentioned this because of the ask paco column. if you’re not familiar, paco is an “actual financial expert” so the request is not out of left field. hope this helps march 26, 2020 11:15pm / claire says... how wonderful! thank you for sharing this. i have not seen rainbows yet. but i am watching the berklee college of music students virtual orchestra performance of “what the world needs now”, over and over and over again. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qagzdvzzhbq march 26, 2020 5:16pm / reply riye says... wasn’t that fantastic? i was smiling all morning after watching that. where i grew up, rainbows are very common. i had no idea how lucky we are until i moved away for college and work. now i’m back in my hometown and every time i see one (we have double rainbows too) i take the time to appreciate it. sending rainbows to all the coj readers! march 26, 2020 5:28pm / blythe says... wow, where did you grow up riye? that sounds magical! march 27, 2020 1:53am / jen says... my kids and i painted rainbows and taped them all over our door to “lure leprechauns” to our home for st. paddy’s. i haven’t taken them down yet because they’re so cheery, i guess we’re a part of something bigger than i realized :) march 27, 2020 2:04am / rusty says... that made me cry happy tears. these people are the future! may the future generations have, show and share more love than previous generations. maybe they can save the planet … it just takes love. ❤❤❤ going to cast it onto the tv tomorrow and watch it with my partner. just showed him the rainbows on my tablet. :) march 27, 2020 10:20am / riye says... @blythe in hawaii. :-) there’s one outside my window this morning w/ your name on it!

we just painted and installed a rainbow today in our kitchen window in munich, germany. so nice to feel connected! here it’s read as a sign for kids,that behind the window with the rainbow there’s another kid who’s currently staying at home. is that the same meaning with the brooklyn rainbows? thank you for sharing uplifting posts in these strange times and stay safe and healthy! march 26, 2020 4:44pm / reply mehreen says... pure magic! we’re all in this together. 🌈💕 march 26, 2020 4:41pm / reply k says... a rainbow for our window was one of the first crafts we made when we started staying at home! (in la) didn’t realize it was happening in so many places. how encouraging! march 27, 2020 2:10am / colleen says... i live in manchester, england and they’re all over the place here! even though we’re all in lockdown, it’s so nice to see them in people’s windows and know that we’re all in this together. the country also had a nationwide clap and cheer for the national health service workers tonight at 8pm. everyone leaned out of their windows and cheered, and someone set off fireworks! i had the news on and it happened in neighbourhoods all around the country. it gave me chills to see everyone come together like that, and makes me feel so much less alone in this uncertain time xx march 26, 2020 4:37pm / reply nina says... we were applauding in london too – wasn’t it nice? afterwards i texted a friend who’s a doctor and she said it happened just as she was walking home from work and she had no idea what was going on 😂 march 26, 2020 6:25pm / k says... same area(ish) (over the irwell) and kids here are definitely into the rainbows, it’s great. that whole building one in the post is making me rethink our own window, though… weekend project? and i was amazed at how loud we could hear the clapping in the suburbs! the brilliant applause heard in the northern quarter makes me quite emotional… long live our nhs. march 26, 2020 6:27pm / susan says... we have this in the north bay, except with howling instead! it’s the most breathtaking thing to hear, all of the howling echoing across the valley. such a great reminder that we’re all in this together. march 26, 2020 7:15pm / robyn says... it was so lovely, wasn’t it! i’m in edinburgh and was a bit sceptical that many would do it but i had to eat my words – the whole street was out, and the claps were echoing round the neighbourhood. i got quite emotional! long live the nhs – we are so lucky to have these amazing health workers, carers and other supporters in our corner. march 26, 2020 7:25pm / robyn says... (i was sceptical because i am generally, nothing to do with the lovey people of edinburgh like my comment might read!) march 26, 2020 7:30pm / jenny says... rainbows are popping up here in brighton, england. and last night it felt like all of our square turned out: everyone cheered and clapped from their windows and doorways to show support for the amazing nhs. it was lovely to have very socially distanced contact with our neighbours, and feel a sense of community – we really are in this together. march 27, 2020 6:05am / anna says... hello neighbour! we’re down the road in stockport and my 3 year old made a rainbow to stick our window. the applause for the nhs last night gave me such a great feeling of community. xx march 27, 2020 7:37am / jessie says... i love this! i made a video for my preschool students showing them rainbows in my neighborhood and asking them to make their own. sending love from chicago! march 26, 2020 4:36pm / reply cancel reply comment name email website notify me of follow-up comments by email. about / contact joanna goddard brighten up your inbox let’s hang out contact me disclosure in order to grow our small business, cup of jo earns revenue in a few different ways. we publish several sponsored posts each month, which are always labeled at the top. we also sometimes earn an affiliate commission on the sales of products we link to. we feature only items we genuinely love and want to share, and this is an arrangement between the retailer and cup of jo (readers never pay more for products). these are the ways we support cup of jo, and allow us to run the site and engage with this community we truly love. thank you for reading! you might also like style a week of outfits: hana asbrink food avocado caprese salad (because!) design have a fun weekend. travel city guide: chicago relationships these five words changed my relationship motherhood psst, what children’s books do you like? about a cup of jo welcome! a cup of jo is a daily lifestyle site for women. we cover everything from fashion to culture to parenthood, and we strive to be authentic. as olive kitteridge said, "there's no such thing as a simple life." thank you for reading. read more style food design travel relationships motherhood about contact faq let's hang out
