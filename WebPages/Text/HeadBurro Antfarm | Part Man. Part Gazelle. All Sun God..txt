base mcpe textures and i‚Äôm not desperate to change it, but given that it costs so little to test them on my phone i thought i‚Äôd give then a go. i need to follow up that preface with the statement that whilst i like the base look i am deeply in love with a cartoony look and have been since i saw it on the yogscast jaffa cake factory series, but the cartoon version that comes with mcpe (for a small fee) seems to have some issues showing the right texture for the right items and it‚Äôs very distracting. so, with all that said, here is owla but using the natural texture pack. my review is ‚Äúok but a little busy and dirty looking ‚Äì the search for one i love goes on!‚Äù share this: click to share on twitter (opens in new window) click to share on reddit (opens in new window) click to
