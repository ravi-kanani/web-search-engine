i am rebuilding the site from the ground up. as of march 27, 2020, only basic blogging is implemented. features that were previously available—and a bunch of new ones—are still under (re)construction, and will be deployed gradually as soon as they are ready. that includes the site-wide search engine, the blogroll, membership registration and, well, more... so all the stuff is coming back? yes, thank you for your patience. note that some of the legacy content (anything i published before the current redesign) may not display as expected—this will be addressed in the future. questions? reach out pages navigation 1 2 3 next the dissident frogman, ©2002-2020 site menuclose home flashposts post first, think later archives he wrote what?!?
