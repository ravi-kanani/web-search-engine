chris thinks the web is an incredible, inspiring, and empowering place and helping people know it better is good for everyone. things i want you to do: you should write a guest post for css-tricks. i bet the chances are high you’re a web person, and the chances are 100% that nobody knows exactly the same stuff you know ;). i do two podcasts you should subscribe to. i’ll put the link to apple podcasts here, but you should be able to search for them on whatever podcast app. shoptalk show & codepen radio. you should go pro with your codepen account. it unlocks a ton of different features like making anything you build private, asset hosting, collaborative features, and more. i made a list of some of my favorite products. like tech stuff, books, games, and coffee making supplies. take a look. if you’re hiring front-end designers or developers, post that job on the codepen job board (which is also the css-tricks and shoptalk job board). if you’d like, email me and i’ll give a coupon to do that for free. 📘 you should buy my book practical svg. it covers everything you need to know about using svg as a front-end developer. wanna get to know me a little bit? this video might help: chriscoyier@gmail.com codepen dribbble twitter github instagram
