i have, and it left me really confused. according to pinterest, the best practice is to make sure your pins and your website have a similar look and feel, and that doing this pays off. in an analysis from pinterest, they found that “pins that went to landing pages with similar imagery had a 13 percent higher online sales lift.” this example from ettitude is really great. the pin they are sharing fits seamlessly in a lot of home decor and design tags on pinterest. and although their website uses different photos, it still has a similar feel to the pin. 4. time your campaigns a big element to social media marketing and campaigns is timing. when are people online and when are people talking about the things you want to talk about? luckily in the case of pinterest, they release annual ‘seasonal insights,’ which helps take away some of the guesswork. a report that contains more than a dozen specific moments that take place throughout the year. for example, their 2019 report shared that users start sharing holiday content in june all the way through december and that content related to the summer starts getting pinned at the beginning of february. they also have monthly trends reports. here’s their latest for december 2019 trends on pinterest, it shares specific trends like the search term ‘peach green tea’ is up 320 percent yoy! these are great free resources that you can leverage to start timing seasonal campaigns around when people are starting to make specific seasonal purchasing decisions. i would never have thought that people start looking at holiday content in june but that’s super-specific information that can go a long way to help with timely campaigns. 5. set up your shop one of the main ways for pinterest to help generate sales is for the products you are selling to be easily available through pinterest. luckily, the platform makes this really easy for brands to set up and feature prominently on their profiles. every business profile on pinterest has the ability for users to create a “shop” tab. the shop tab is just what it sounds like, a place where users can go to see all of the products your brand is selling. on the flip side, brands can leverage that tab to share pins that link directly to their sales pages for the specific product. pinterest makes this whole process quite easy, they even have a method for importing new products through pinterest catalogs. all you have to do is have your data source approved and then as you add new products to your website, they get automagically added to pinterest as well. we hope this guide helps you get started with or double down on your efforts with pinterest. let us know about your experience with pinterest in the comments! if you want even more pinterest resources, the pinterest team has created a free pinterest academy with tons of lessons in there. originally written dec 20, 2019. last updated jan 24, 2020 share with buffer hailley griffis public relations at buffer and podcaster at makeworkwork. the rest of the time i do brazilian jiu-jitsu, read a lot of fiction and drink tea. related articles the best new pinterest marketing strategies working today pinterest 80,000+ social media marketers trust buffer see all case studies about us our team feedback contact us tweet @ us press faq guides & tutorials case studies webinars what is social media marketing?
