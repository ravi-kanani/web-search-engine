it’s ok to remind yourself of what you went through and what you overcame. we may not be able to control what happens to us but we can control how we react to it. we must remember that all things are powerless unless we give them power. so let that power be empathy, understanding, kindness, grace, love and respect. remember that god has and always will have your back. have faith that life will get better as long as we believe in ourselves. we must internally feel grateful for everything and strive to become better people daily.” / (c) khloé kardashian/instagram katy perry and orlando bloom “when you’re in bed before midnight is when you know you’re starting the new year right,” perry wrote on ig, in a video alongside bloom and their two adorable pups taken from bed nice and early on new year’s eve!
