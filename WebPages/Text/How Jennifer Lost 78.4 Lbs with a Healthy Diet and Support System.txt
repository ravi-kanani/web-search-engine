the story i‚Äôm going to share with you today comes from jenifer, and as you‚Äôll learn in this story, she faced the same struggles as many of you. jenifer‚Äôs story with us starts when she weighed in at 236.6 pounds at the very young age of 20. meet jenifer ‚Äúmy name is jenifer, and i am 21 years old. i was born and raised and am still living in idaho. i have been overweight most of my life but after high school is when i started putting on weight that made it more noticeable. before discovering this life-changing program i weighed in at a whopping 236.6 pounds at the age of 20.‚Äù life started getting less enjoyable. i was breathing but i wasn‚Äôt really living. life consisted of low energy, no motivation, lying around and hiding myself. jenifer‚Äôs turning point everyone has a turning point. i‚Äôm sure that some people have many turning points. times when they decide that enough is enough. it‚Äôs time for a new diet. a change. this was what did it for jenifer: ‚Äúit became a struggle to look at myself in the mirror. i was tired of hating the person that looked back at me and i knew it was time for a change. so, october 2017 i decided to go in head first and become a vegan. three months later, i was down 20 pounds and so proud of myself! but the problem was that i needed to lose more weight, and my weight wasn‚Äôt budging. in march of 2018, i took to pinterest and randomly discovered avocadu one day. little did i know that it was about to change my life forever! i did my research and decided to go for it. i mean what did i have to lose‚Ä¶ besides weight, right?! getting support along the way when we designed this program, the 21-day fat loss challenge, we knew that one of the most important factors to weight loss was accountability. we needed to have some kind of accountability built into the program, so we created a private community support group for all of our challenge members. a place where they could support one another and get help and questions answered. three years later, we have over 3,000 women in this private support group sharing recipes, encouragement, and motivation along the way! jenifer shared this awesome photo of her spinach chips in the group: here is jenifer‚Äôs experience with the group: ‚Äúthe next day, i was thrown into a facebook group and from the moment i made my first post, i was supported all around. i read through a ton of motivating posts, looked at pictures of food and read through everything i could. i felt comfortable posting pictures of my journey and knowing that others were going through the same journey i was. it was amazing! it was motivating! it was just what i needed!‚Äù jenifer‚Äôs weight loss results ‚Äúthe first round was difficult but i was being powered by results. i struggled with changing the way i ate, cutting out sugar and getting my head in the game. but i learned that healthy food doesn‚Äôt have to be boring (it isn‚Äôt all salads and veggies either)! 21 days later, i was down 13 pounds. i was blown away! 13 pounds in just 21 days was remarkable. i felt so much better! i noticed changes in my appearance and knew that i was doing something that would make me feel good in the long run. the next few rounds were not one after the other, but they did happen throughout the year. by the beginning of 2019‚Ä¶ i was down to 158.2 pounds, from a size xl to a size s, a size 17 in pants to a size 5, and a life that changed for the good. ‚Äúlosing weight is the easy part. putting yourself out there and doing it is the hard part. just go for it! jump in head first, take those before pictures, embrace the person you are at the moment you begin and just start because it is worth all those successes as well as struggles. what is the 21-day fat loss challenge?
