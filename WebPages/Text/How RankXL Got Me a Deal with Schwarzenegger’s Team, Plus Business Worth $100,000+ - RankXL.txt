authority seo 2.0 blog about tools contact how rankxl got me a deal with schwarzenegger‚Äôs team, plus business worth $100,000+ by chris lee 38 comments last updated on: april 5, 2019 this post is written by rob palmer, who i met when he joined my course authority seo. this is the story of how i turned an investment of a few hundred dollars into over $100,000 of consultancy work ‚Äì and got to work with one of the most famous people in the world as a result. before i get into the story, though, let me make it clear that i have no connection to chris or rankxl except as a satisfied customer. this is what happened‚Ä¶ it all started on the day that i purchased chris‚Äôs rankxl course last year. it wasn‚Äôt a decision i took lightly. after all, i have been in the seo game for a long time, and many online courses i buy turn out to be pretty much worthless. but i had been following the rankxl blog for some time, and i liked chris‚Äôs approach. in particular, i liked the idea of a white-hat strategy for building an authority site that google loves. i could see how this could generate income for years to come, without crashing and burning. so when the rankxl course opened up for enrolment, i pulled out my credit card and took the plunge. i wasn‚Äôt disappointed. the strategies were clearly laid out and carefully explained. i could see that rankxl gave me a solid footprint for building a blog into a sound business. but there was only one way to find out if the strategies really worked, and that was to try them out on a brand new blog. so i began to plan and execute an seo strategy based firmly on the rankxl principles. building the blog i decided to go into the body building niche, because semrush told me there were gazillions of keywords to rank for, and apart from the 800-pound gorilla of bodybuilding.com, the competition wasn‚Äôt super strong. i built the blog, and then started adding content. i wrote the blog posts myself initially, but then decided i needed some extra help. so i tried iwriter, as suggested in rankxl. i tried five different writers, and four of them were awful ‚Äì my dog could have written better. i scratched them off my list immediately. but the fifth writer turned out to be a real gem. she writes with a style very similar to my own, and she can write well-researched and easy-to-read articles on any subject i give her. and all of this a ridiculously cheap rate. i still use her for content today, and this has saved me a fortune in content creation fees. starting my link-building campaign soon the blog was full of great content which cost me next to nothing. i was ready to start generating links, using rankxl strategies. i decided that i didn‚Äôt just want to cold pitch people and beg for a link. i thought it would be better to have something to offer them, to build some rapport and create a relationship. i figured that many bloggers in the bodybuilding niche would be bodybuilders first, and bloggers second. they probably had a lot to say about bodybuilding, but had limited knowledge of how to promote their blog. so i spent some time writing a detailed guide on ‚Äòhow to drive traffic to your bodybuilding or fitness blog.‚Äô i put a lot of effort into it, and made sure it was genuinely useful to fitness bloggers. then i found someone on fiverr to convert this into a stylish pdf. when that was ready, i started contacting bloggers in the bodybuilding niche and offering them a copy of the report for free. many people responded, and i was able to engage people and start a conversation. once they had been suitably ‚Äòwarmed up,‚Äô i pitched them a guest blog post, or secured a link another way. this worked great, and i started picking up some good quality links. the traffic on the blog started to grow. a whole new world of opportunity but then i got an email that changed everything. it arrived out of the blue from dan, the owner of digitalmuscle.com ‚Äì the new home of arnold schwarzenegger‚Äôs arnold classic webcast. dan and arnie have been friends and business associates for decades, and this latest venture was a result of that partnership. digitalmuscle.com had acquired exclusive rights to webcast the arnold classic bodybuilding events as they happened. dan had received an email from me via the website, and asked to see a copy of the free report. i sent it to him, and he loved the strategy (all based on rankxl principles, of course). he immediately shot me an email which simply said: we arranged to chat on skype later that day. as i live in bangkok, and dan is in florida, this resulted in me having to stay up until 3.00am to make the call. but it was worth it! on skype, we spoke at length about seo and online marketing. digitalmuscle.com had just launched, and dan needed to ramp up traffic ahead of the arnold classic webcast, which schwarzenegger himself would be involved in. after a while, we worked out a consultancy agreement, where i would become chief marketing officer for digitalmuscle.com, and work on search engine optimization for the site. we had a deal: transcription: thanks for putting that together. it seems fair. let‚Äôs begin with a 30 hour commitment for the initial first month. depending on how things are progressing we can re-visit the time allocation prior to starting the second month. if this is agreeable, let‚Äôs have one more follow up skype call so i can explain certain parameters relating to content direction to ensure that the site content maintains the planned direction. over the next few months, i spent a lot of time working on the site and on incoming links, and we got great results. as a result, the arnold classic webcast was a huge success, and both dan and the governator were delighted with the results. from here, things started to snowball. the ‚Äòschwarzenegger connection‚Äô started opening doors for me in the fitness world. soon i started getting referrals and picking up more seo contracts. initially these were with bodybuilding blogs, but this soon widened into the broader market of health and fitness. as of today, i have multiple 12-month seo contracts in place. when you add them all up, the total value is over $100,000. hopefully many of them will be renewed next year, which will increase the total value significantly. and all of this is a direct result of investing just a few hundred dollars in rankxl. quite simply, it‚Äôs the best investment i have ever made. this chain of events occurred because rankxl offers a strategy that is easy to understand, simple to follow, and clearly designed to generate quality links. that‚Äôs what motivated dan to hire me to implement this strategy, and also what led to the referrals and recommendations. so if you are simply interested in building your own blogs, that‚Äôs fine ‚Äì the rankxl strategy will certainly get results. but as i have discovered, there is also an opportunity to implement this strategy for others, and make an excellent consultancy income in the process. whichever way you do it, you can be sure an investment in rankxl‚Äôs seo course is money very well spent. i‚Äôve been so busy working on these lucrative seo contracts that i‚Äôve had no time to work on my own bodybuilding blog which started it all. but i intend to return to working on that soon. as arnie himself says: ‚Äúi‚Äôll be back.‚Äù ‚Äî rob palmer is a full-time blogger, online marketer and seo consultant. find out more at go freelance. facebook twitter pinterest you might also like... how my blog made money in all the wrong ways and sold for 125x monthly revenue how to build a profitable niche website (the ultimate guide) changing web hosts: look what happened when i switched to wpx hosting 38 comments reply loz james december 13, 2016 at 10:56 am rob & chris i love this success story ‚Äì what an inspiring way to work hard and hustle your way to $100k. i‚Äôve got the rank xl course as well and i agree that‚Äôs it‚Äôs one of the best available online ‚Äì in fact it‚Äôs up there in my favourite two courses with brian dean‚Äôs seo that works. cheers!

i‚Äôve used iwriter as well with no luck. any suggestions or who you use? i also have found that getting guest posts in my niche has been the most beneficial and my go-to. i haven‚Äôt managed to get a link by any other method in the guide yet, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt work! reply chris lee december 14, 2016 at 1:42 pm if you‚Äôre looking for higher quality writers, you can find them on upwork. that‚Äôs awesome, aaron! yeah, certain methods work better than others depending on your niche. reply theodore nwangene december 13, 2016 at 12:08 pm this is mind blowing rob, a big congrats to you for this great achievement. no doubt, chris course rocks, i‚Äôve been implementing lately on a new site i‚Äôm building and, i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll come out with my own mouth watering success soon :). everything boils down to taking massive action towards whatever you learn, not just learning and forgetting it. if i may ask, how about the site you‚Äôre building that brought about this success, has it started making you money? thanks for sharing. reply chris lee december 14, 2016 at 1:42 pm great to see you here, theodore üôÇ reply imran ghani december 13, 2016 at 12:43 pm thanks really encouraging‚Ä¶..:) reply chris lee december 14, 2016 at 1:43 pm thanks for reading, imran! reply marcello december 13, 2016 at 3:59 pm very nice test and testimonial to your site and your course cris, i just hope that reopening the course does not get too expensive. one more question, do you still take a large part of your earnings with google adsense or earn more by selling your own products? reply chris lee december 14, 2016 at 1:43 pm adsense is still a large part of it, but i‚Äôm definitely experimenting with creating products and implementing email funnels, and it‚Äôs been going very well so far üôÇ reply jeremy december 13, 2016 at 7:50 pm chris, just another awesome and inspiring article, we‚Äôre all here to be successful at our own niche websites. thanks again for a quality content, looking forward to purchasing the rankxl course since i heard nothing but good reviews for it. jeremy reply chris lee december 14, 2016 at 1:44 pm thanks jeremy! reply john paul december 13, 2016 at 11:25 pm thats inspiring reply chris lee december 14, 2016 at 1:44 pm thanks for reading, john paul üôÇ reply faraz jafari december 14, 2016 at 3:10 am this was a great read. but him not having the opportunity to work on his own site seemed like a big trade off, when you think long-term. however, it‚Äôs great to know such opportunities and can come from the course. faraz reply chris lee december 14, 2016 at 1:46 pm i wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a big trade off. if you find something that works, then going all-in on it (especially in the beginning stages) is the smart thing to do. he can always go back to his sites later on üôÇ reply shree december 14, 2016 at 3:23 am that‚Äôs an inspiring read. congratulations and all the very best. may all the contracts get renewed and you get even more. üôÇ reply chris lee december 14, 2016 at 1:46 pm thanks for reading, shree üôÇ reply mike december 14, 2016 at 11:41 pm keep it coming.. im making my return in 2017 more content like this will keep me focused! reply chris lee december 15, 2016 at 3:20 am great to hear from you mike! best wishes for 2017! reply mitchell december 16, 2016 at 12:50 am thanks for another great post. that is very inspiring. i don‚Äôt have much luck with freelance writers so far. just wonder if i can get the writer‚Äôs contact mentioned in the post? if so, please email it to me. much appreciated. reply chris lee december 16, 2016 at 6:09 pm an easy way would be to try upwork, be very specific with the writing style you‚Äôre looking for, and then ask for samples of their writing. it‚Äôll take some time, but you should be able to find a good match. reply jessica parla december 17, 2016 at 11:36 pm if 4 of 5 writers you tried on iwriter were awful, that means there are no guarantees that you have better chance to find good writers on iwriter than on fiverr. the bottom line is you need to consistently use your judgment and also check their work afterward. reply chris lee december 25, 2016 at 9:52 pm you definitely need to read over their work first!
