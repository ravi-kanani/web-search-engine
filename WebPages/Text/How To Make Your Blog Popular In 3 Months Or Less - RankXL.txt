authority seo 2.0 blog about tools contact how to make your blog popular in 3 months or less by coral ouellette 4 comments last updated on: february 17, 2019 want to make your blog popular in 3 months? first, think about it in terms of real life situations. what‚Äôs the easiest way to get popular in real life? answer: get to know popular people. hang out with the ‚Äúin‚Äù crowd and you‚Äôre automatically popular by association. so how do you do this online? answer: networking. influencer networking is the most effective way to kick start a new blog. blogs run in the same circles you may have noticed that sometimes new faces suddenly appear to be everywhere. every blog you read seems to be either talking about them, interviews them in their podcast, or has a guest post written from them. what people don‚Äôt know is that it‚Äôs just a matter of perception. it only seems this way because blogs in the same industries as each other just run in the same circles. in reality, they can be featured on less than 10 sites. but to the people who follow these blogs, it seems like they‚Äôre ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù. i call it riding the promotion chain you‚Äôre essentially creating a promotion chain for yourself. one successful connection with an influencer makes it easier to get the next one, which makes it even easier to get the next one. if timed all at once, suddenly your name and your blog seem to be extremely popular. so how do you do this? dedicate 3 months you might be thinking‚Ä¶ 3 months?? that‚Äôs crazy long. no way. but take into consideration the fact that most blogs don‚Äôt ever become popular. 3 months is nothing. and it doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre going to be dedicating 100% of your time for 3 months to do this. it just means we‚Äôre going to give it 3 months before we expect to see any substantial results. how to start connecting with influencers building the promotion chain takes some time. but it‚Äôs totally worth the effort if you want to go from new website to popular website in the least number of steps. when‚Äôs the last time you dedicated an entire day to networking? for most people, the answer‚Äôs probably never. as effective as networking is, the majority of people don‚Äôt take the time to do it. if you‚Äôre new at this, you just want to take one day out of the week to work on nothing but networking with influencers. throughout the day, all you‚Äôre going to do is reach out to new influencers in your industry, introduce yourself, and start a relationship with them as a colleague in the same industry. this can be done on twitter, blog commenting, or email. i strongly prefer email as it‚Äôs easier to keep the conversation going. here‚Äôs what you should be doing, and what kind of results you should expect. month 1: reaching out you‚Äôre simply reaching out to influencers in the same niche as you. simply find their email, and say hello. it can be as simple as: hey chris! love what you‚Äôre doing on rankxl. my name‚Äôs jim and i run the marketing blog www.example.com. just wanted to say hello and tell you how much i‚Äôm enjoying your content. keep up the great work! cheers, jim that‚Äôs an email that makes me happy to get. and i‚Äôll always check out the website to see what it‚Äôs all about, since it‚Äôs in the same niche as i am. i might decide to subscribe to his email list, share one of his posts, or link to it when i‚Äôm writing in the future. this kind of networking sounds really simple, but here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs effective. now i know jim. i know his site. i know he‚Äôs not a spammer. if he messages me again in the future, i‚Äôm not guessing who this person is or what his intentions are. once you do this, you‚Äôre done. move onto the next influencer and repeat the process. month 2: the second step of the relationship the second step is to give them something of value. for me, it‚Äôs either a link from my site, a share from my twitter account, or a tip to help them out. that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre doing in month 2. you‚Äôre going through every influencer you‚Äôve started a conversation with, and doing something for them. it‚Äôs easier than it sounds. if someone publishes a new blog post, share it on twitter. when you‚Äôre writing a new blog post, link to one of their articles (if it‚Äôs relevant). if you see something that can be improved on their site, let them know with a friendly tip. let them know about any links. if you share their stuff on twitter, they‚Äôre already going to know since they‚Äôll receive a notification. you don‚Äôt need to separately email them to let them know. but if you link to them from your blog posts, simply email them and let them know that you gave them some love üôÇ hey chris! just wanted to let you know i gave you a shoutout in my latest blog post: url of your blog post here. cheers! jim that‚Äôs it! more often than not, they‚Äôll check it out and share it on social media. month 3: the ask in month 3, we‚Äôre going in for the ‚Äúask‚Äù. you can ask for either a guest post on their blog, or an interview on their podcast. which one you choose depends on the influencers‚Äô activity. simply send them an email saying: hey chris! i‚Äôve been working on a guest post that i think would do really well on your website. hoping to publish there. mind if i send it over for you to take a look? and no worries if you don‚Äôt find it to be a good fit. cheers, jim the work you‚Äôve done for the previous 2 months will make this stage much more successful than if you were contacting them for the first time. if you can do this for every influencer you‚Äôve connected with, all you need to do is get on 5-10 sites and suddenly, your brand and blog will appear to be everywhere. you‚Äôll get a flood of traffic, some juicy links from authoritative blogs, social shares, and most importantly, email subscribers. you‚Äôve just built a popular blog with just 3 months of carefully planned promotion using influencer networking. facebook twitter pinterest you might also like... practice makes perfect: how to master the art of blogging blog hosting review: the best hosting for bloggers in 2019 how much is an email list worth?
