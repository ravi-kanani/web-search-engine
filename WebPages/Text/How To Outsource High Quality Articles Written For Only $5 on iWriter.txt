authority seo 2.0 blog about tools contact how to get high quality articles written for only $5 on iwriter by chris lee 87 comments last updated on: june 24, 2019 when my blogs began to grow in traffic, i started to experiment with hiring others to write my articles for me. when your blog starts to build up authority, it becomes extremely profitable to start scaling. content published on your domain gets indexed faster, ranks faster, and brings in more traffic from long-tail keywords. researching, writing, and formatting probably took the most of my time and it seemed like it would be impossible to scale my sites to hundreds of pages liked i planned at the pace i was going. so, i decided to try out iwriter, which seemed to have to the simplest to use platform. although i have a full-time writer for my main site now, iwriter is what i’ve been using to outsource my articles and get them written for me for years before my first hire. but there’s a right way and a wrong way to get your articles written on this site. the writers on iwriter can produce some really spammy, low-quality articles if you do it the wrong way. but i’ve figured out a way to get around this without having to pay for their top option. i’ll show you exactly what that is here. but first, a little background on what iwriter is and how it works. how iwriter works with iwriter, you simply log in, order an article, and it’s written for you within 24 hours. sometimes it’s faster. i’ve never had to wait over 24 hours. there are hundreds of thousands of writers on their site, and when a job is posted, it’s first-come first-serve to the person who wants to accept the job. it’s this simplicity that drove me to their site in the first place. ranked by skill level, priced by skill level the writers on the site are ranked by skill level. (from 1 to 5 stars) you’re able to choose which level of writers you want to submit your job to. the higher the level, the higher the price. i have never tried the highest option. it’s ridiculously high in my opinion, and is more suited for large publishing agencies who want to make 100% sure they receive the highest quality content. instead, i always go for the basic option. this is their lowest (and cheapest) option available. that’s $5 for a 700-word article and $3 for a 500-word article! picking the lowest option doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re the weakest writers. the great thing about iwriter is that this submits your job to all levels of writers. it doesn’t just submit it to the lowest ranked writers. obviously, 5 star writers aren’t going to accept low-paying jobs, but there are plenty of good writers on the platform who just don’t have enough experience to raise their rankings. but no matter which level you choose, there’s one thing you need to do in order to get a high-quality article written for you. the writers aren’t bad writers. they’re just instructed to be bad. when i first started using iwriter, i noticed something common every time i ordered an article. they had an extremely high keyword density. it seems like iwriter’s writers are trained to write “seo articles” and maintain a high keyword density throughout. i can only assume that it’s because most people who order articles on the platform request stuff like this. the articles read so bad. the first few times i ordered, i had to ask for a re-write (which is free to do). when i asked them, “can you not make this an seo article?” the difference in quality was like night and day. the thing is, these writers are pretty good writers. the only reason the articles sucked was because they had to stray away from their natural form of writing and instead try to fit in keywords all over the place. when i realized this, iwriter suddenly became my secret sauce. i was getting high quality articles at a very cheap price. plus, because there were so many writers on the platform, i never had to wait more than a few hours. my job would get accepted almost instantly and it would be completed within the next few hours. after a while, i had my own little template for writing instructions that ensured i get only the highest quality articles at the cheapest price. so how should you write the instructions? the first thing is to make sure that you tell them: “this is not an seo article.” in iwriter, you’re given a box where you set your keywords. whatever you put in here, writers think that they need to heavily optimize the article for. instead of a my keyword, i’ll put in the title of my article. it’s important to come up with the title yourself. that gives the writer good direction on what to write the article about. under article purpose, write your instructions like this: this is the most important part. just tell them to write naturally and not to focus on keyword density. this alone makes the article so much better quality. instruct them to use sources and to list them at the bottom of the article. this, again, makes the article even higher quality because it makes sure that the writer uses sources and gives them to you, too. under special instructions, just make a note about spinning and scraping. this is really important. there are a few writers on iwriter who will just take a bunch of articles off the web, put them together and then spin it. this note makes sure you prevent them from accepting your job. and that’s it, really. this is what the final job description should look like. how to get started with iwriter the reason that i got started using their platform was because i never outsourced any article writing before them. i didn’t really want to invest a whole lot of money and i didn’t want to wait a long time to get my articles delivered. getting started with iwriter is really fast. first, set up your free account. just go to iwriter.com and click this button to get started. after that, just log in, deposit however much you need through paypal, and you can start outsourcing articles. conclusion iwriter won’t give you world-class outsourced content. it’s not the best place to be ordering your articles for meaty posts targeting big keywords. you’ll get higher quality articles using textbroker for something like that. what i use them for is my inner pages – smaller articles targeting smaller keywords. it’s the easiest way for me to get some quick articles written without paying very much money. $5 for a 700 word-article is really cheap. you might argue that you could potentially find cheaper writers at places like elance, but you’ll also have to go through the process of submitting a job, researching applicants, and interviewing them. iwriter is the best option if you don’t have much experience with outsourcing and want some good articles written quickly for your new blog. and with the tips i’ve given you, you should be able to get them at the lowest price possible. visit iwriter.com >> edited addition: victor just made a great comment with some more helpful tips. he was actually a writer on the site, so this is extra helpful. thanks for sharing, victor! facebook twitter pinterest you might also like... the advantages of building an seo practice site what’s better… building one niche site or multiple sites?

is it a silo structure? thanks for all you do chris. reply chris lee june 21, 2015 at 1:16 am hey dave. i do a lot of interlinking with my inner pages, and a few other tactics like related links and next/previous posts. reply kenny june 20, 2015 at 7:04 pm been using iwriter for a while and never thought of telling them “this is not an seo article”. now i know. thanks man. by the way, what plugin are you using for your opt in box at the end of your article? reply chris lee june 21, 2015 at 1:15 am hey kenny. no plugin is used there. i just designed it myself. reply imran june 21, 2015 at 1:51 am really helpful. thanks chris. previously i used freelancer.com and fiverr.com. i’ll definitely check iwriter too. my experience at fiverr.com is also good. chris. what do you suggest in terms of posting about the number of articles with same 700 words strength? i mean how many articles per week with this length should be posted for niche like (jobsite and technical blogs etc.)? thanks once again. reply chris lee june 21, 2015 at 2:22 am thanks imran. post schedule will really depend on the type of site you’re running and what your audience expects from you. for instance, a tech blog with tech news and updates will have to be updated frequently. a job site will have to be updated with new jobs frequently. but if your site was simply a blog with evergreen content like “how to” articles and tips on getting a job, then post schedule isn’t that important in the beginning stages. once you build authority to your site and it gets to the stage where it’s ranking for everything as soon as they’re published, then you will want to ramp up your content production to take advantage of that. reply imran june 22, 2015 at 3:40 am thanks chris 🙂 reply steve june 21, 2015 at 7:29 am good advise. i will try this thanks. love your posts 🙂 off topic : with your paid course, how about a monthly payment option via paypal ? regards steve reply chris lee june 21, 2015 at 2:12 pm thanks steve. i’ll consider doing that. will have to work out structuring first, but thanks for the suggestion. reply jeff schuman june 21, 2015 at 8:11 am interesting article chris. why do you buy 700 words as opposed to 500 or 1000 words? thanks. -jeff schuman reply chris lee june 21, 2015 at 2:05 pm thanks, jeff. no reason in particular. i just think 700 is a good number to have more in-depth content than 500. i do choose 1000-1500 words some of the time. but those are pretty long so it really depends on the topic/title i select to have written. reply jeff schuman june 21, 2015 at 11:22 pm ok thanks again. reply alex zemkus june 22, 2015 at 5:55 pm great advice in your article chris. i ordered an article from iwriter based on your steps and can honestly say i’m very happy with it. thanks. reply chris lee june 22, 2015 at 7:31 pm that’s great, alex. glad to hear that 🙂 reply mmd june 24, 2015 at 6:48 am i’m loving this strategy! i just signed up and literally copied all your text fields. hopefully my first article is as good as the ones you’re getting. $5 is quite a bargain. reply chris lee june 24, 2015 at 1:20 pm awesome 🙂 yeah, it really is. reply sophy june 29, 2015 at 2:19 am useful tip, you only show an article per project. could you show multiple articles order per project in iwriter? reply chris lee june 29, 2015 at 3:45 am hey sophy, you’re able to do multiple projects by adding in more keywords. you have to put your keyword in a separate line and each one results in another article. that’s useful if you have the same instructions for every single article. you can also re-use the same instruction and options you chose for future projects as templates. they’re auto-saved and will be on the left-hand side of the instruction input page. reply sophy july 1, 2015 at 12:21 am thank you chris! i apply your role on last order article get best result and cheap articles. how many words you recommend per article? reply chris lee july 1, 2015 at 2:21 am that’s great sophy! that depends what kind of article you’re writing and the search volume it’s targeting. i usually go for around 500-700 for smaller keywords and over 2000 for bigger ones. reply dusty july 3, 2015 at 8:08 pm hi chris, do you use any software or services to check for scraping and spinning? thanks! reply chris lee july 4, 2015 at 2:57 am hey dusty, i sometimes use copyscape, but usually i don’t. i just give it a read and then approve or reject. just having the written warning is often enough, and you can usually tell by skimming through it if it was scraped or spun. reply dusty july 5, 2015 at 5:26 am thanks chris 🙂 reply brian jackson july 4, 2015 at 7:32 pm this is a great tip! i was about to use iwriter for a project and i will try this method. i can always seo the article afterwards, and in a way that is way less spammy. reply chris lee july 5, 2015 at 2:42 am cool! reply mikejk july 9, 2015 at 6:18 am hello chris, i just wonder what is the inner page? can you give and example ? i know we have the main content page for our main keyword but where is this inner page? is it only linked in the main article? or where is it ? i’m a beginner to this internet marketing thing so really not sure what to ask. reply chris lee july 9, 2015 at 3:37 pm hey mike, inner page just means smaller pages targeting smaller keywords. things like blog posts. reply mikejr july 11, 2015 at 4:43 am hi again chris. you mean smaller post or smaller page ? is it the same anyway? reply chris lee july 11, 2015 at 3:53 pm smaller post targeting smaller keywords 🙂 post or page doesn’t matter in wordpress. mikejr july 11, 2015 at 8:21 pm thank you very much!!! 🙂 reply sheyi july 14, 2015 at 2:28 pm hey chris, thanks for this heads up. i’m just about ordering articles from iwriter and i’m surely using this format. i’m going for 300 words per article as i’ll have to link them together to make the homepage article! i’ll update my result soon. reply chris lee july 14, 2015 at 11:05 pm cool, let me know how it works out. reply geva july 15, 2015 at 10:11 pm instruct the writer. i got the point. thank you veru much! reply chris lee july 15, 2015 at 11:24 pm no problem, thanks for reading. reply brad july 24, 2015 at 12:50 pm just got an article back using your tips, i have to say, this was the best article i’ve ever had using outsourcing. better than my elance, odesk, writers. plus it was alot cheaper. lol. reply chris lee july 24, 2015 at 2:41 pm that’s awesome, brad! glad you’re happy with it. reply angela bergeron august 13, 2015 at 10:59 pm hi chris, another great post! just curious when you give them information on lets say a 700 article, you don’t worry about the main keyword ranking or the lsi keywords. i guess i’m asking is how would these post rank without the proper density. thanks in advance. reply chris lee august 15, 2015 at 2:22 pm thanks angela. it would rank because the post is about the keyword… if that makes sense. you would obviously optimize the title and header tags inside the article. reply jane august 20, 2015 at 11:59 pm hey chris you are a lifesaver! i was having horrible luck with odesk. i’ve just sent in an order based on your instructions. fingers crossed! thanks! regards jane reply chris lee august 21, 2015 at 2:12 am awesome, hope you see some good results with it, jane! reply jane august 21, 2015 at 10:08 pm not too bad for the 1st article and it was done in less than a couple of hours. just requested for a rewrite. 🙂 reply chris lee august 22, 2015 at 3:46 pm nice. or if you just don’t like the writer’s style you can just reject it and then submit it again to a new writer. reply shaun september 15, 2015 at 11:51 am hi chris. recently, i am launching a new authority site but i couldn’t afford to write the articles for it (though i will be writing the pillar articles myself). i have just two questions. first, do you post a lot of 700 word length of content on your niche sites? second, how much would i need to pay for around 1500 words? i am planning to make each and every post, at least the first 50 of extremely high quality with article length not less than 1500. this is because these first 50 articles will most likely target articles that i would like to rank for in the long term. reply chris lee september 15, 2015 at 4:12 pm hey shaun, yeah i post a lot of shorter articles under 1000 words. iwriter only has options for 1000 words and 2000 words and not 1500. 2000 words would cost you around $15. with textbroker, it would cost you around $40-$50, but would be higher quality if that’s what you’re looking for. reply victor nyorani november 13, 2015 at 1:09 am i was once a freelancer on iwriter and i fully agree with your critique of the site. without a doubt, a client’s instructions can greatly influence the kind of results he/ she gets. having been a writer on the site, let me give you a couple more “insider” secrets that clients may not realize (i’m still a writer, but not on iwriter): 1. many top-notch writers prefer long-term projects more than higher pay. this is because they are fully confident of there ability to continually deliver top-quality; hence, they know that they can keep a client happy for a long time. if you want to grab the attention of such writers, make sure to mention that the first article you’re requesting also serves as a test to evaluate whether the writer is fit for a long term project. 2. to further prevent utterly incompetent writers from working on your article, you can include instructions for the writer who picks your job request to first send you a short message before writing the article. just by reading that short message, you would easily identify the most incompetent writers. you can then instruct such writers to cancel the project, so others can take it up. if you use this tactic, you should quickly respond to the writer’s message, since iwriter gives a limited time for writing the article. i have many more ideas on how clients can get the best writers on iwriter, but i don’t want to clog up this comment section with a whole article. reply chris lee november 13, 2015 at 1:25 am victor, that’s awesome info. thanks for sharing this with us. great to get feedback from a writer’s perspective on that site! i’ve added your comment into the post 🙂 reply victor nyorani november 14, 2015 at 1:05 am awesome. reply francesko december 21, 2015 at 10:48 am you are a genius chris! i’ ve found your site yesterday and i bookmarked it directly. thank you for the information and tips that you give here. i’ am waiting to enroll also to your niche course that starts on january 2016. i wanted to ask you, are these articles on iwriter top-notch to generate with google adsense. i have a husky site that i’ ve created 2 days ago. i wanted to get some top-notch articles and to start it right away. i want to create an online bussines with it. it’s for serious purpose. please, let me know! best regards, francesko! reply chris lee december 21, 2015 at 11:16 pm thanks francesko 🙂 they’re not top-notch content. but for $5, they’re pretty good and usable for the smaller articles on your site. for pages targeting big keywords, and articles over 2000 words, i don’t normally order those from iwriter. reply francesko december 23, 2015 at 7:13 am thank you for your reply! please, can you tell me which is the best choice to target a wide audience. i wanted to test it in this way, to build around 15-20 pages and to see how it goes, how its gonna be ranked in google and how much traffic should come in the box. which one to order for big keywords, and do you suggest it? thank you! reply chris lee december 23, 2015 at 2:58 pm for bigger keywords, i hire on upwork (more screening required) or order at least a 4 star on textbroker (a little bit higher quality than iwriter). reply lee december 25, 2015 at 11:01 pm i’m a professional writer, well, as professional as writers can be. i am apalled that so much spam gets offered as genuine writing so i understand your frustration. but this also offend me as a writer and as a person because i put a lot of work in my writing and then people like this come around… my frustration with requesters is – many of them also have no grammar skills or even basic english, yet expect perfection and will not pay for good work sayin – ‘sorry, bad grammar’. well i call bs when i see it. sorry about the lenghty comment. but it frustrates me. reply chris lee december 28, 2015 at 5:44 pm understand the frustration, lee. i agree it’s not always fair on the writer’s side of the curtain, and certain platforms are more suitable for orders rather than for work. reply nadhem january 20, 2016 at 5:29 pm hey chris, thanks for the great article. what about freelancer can i get quality articles from 1500 words or more ? thanks. reply chris lee january 21, 2016 at 9:52 pm i haven’t tried freelancer, so i can’t say. but yeah, you should be able to. it’ll just take a little more digging to find the right writer. reply martha march 2, 2016 at 2:52 am great advice, thanks! just want to ask, did the page with article you buy from iwritter get the good position on serp? reply chris lee march 2, 2016 at 11:34 am thanks martha 🙂 yup, but make sure your site isn’t just only articles from iwriter. i talk a bit about that in this post: https://www.rankxl.com/common-mistakes-building-new-niche-site/. reply shalvic kelly march 25, 2016 at 5:19 am i believe i’m one of the best writers on iwriter and you can place all the requests you want with me. top quality guaranteed. username: academics101 cheers. nice info chris! thumbs up bro reply chris lee march 25, 2016 at 12:35 pm like the hustle 🙂 thanks, and good luck shalvic! reply shalvic kelly march 25, 2016 at 5:25 am ps: i feel you lee…. too many non-native english requesters with bad grammar rejecting perfectly written work on grounds of poor grammar! utterly annoying. i think some of them are not genuine and they only post work to reject it and give 1 stars no matter the quality of work done just to mess with your rating!!!?? reply chris lee march 25, 2016 at 12:36 pm yeah, i can imagine what that would be like for a writer. stressful. reply efrain avelar april 14, 2016 at 5:27 pm wow thanks this is very helpful when starting out im new at all this been researching iwriter for some time found templates but did not know if they were to harsh with this to the point information here im sold love the great to the simple and to the point content you have on your site thank you i wish there where more sites like yours out there oh and for the record the longtail staff directed me your way. reply chris lee april 22, 2016 at 1:39 am thanks efrain! happy to hear it was helpful. reply amrissalam abdoe may 5, 2016 at 11:28 am seems that the problem of writers up there in your post, is simply because they trying to make the seo content sometimes it’s over, but my only problem when i take a job there and submit it, my only problem was my grammar so poor, and they were rejects my article. im so sad because of that :'( reply chris lee may 8, 2016 at 9:04 am some practice and consistent writing will help with that. reply himadri may 15, 2016 at 4:23 pm wonderful article chris! i did not know about iwriter. i only used fiverr to order short length articles. i will surely give a try to get some inner page articles from iwriter. how do you check the copyscore of the article? do you have any special tool that you want to share with your readers? i check the newly received articles via online plagiarism checker but i am not sure about the authenticity of those online checkers. if you know about any tool that can help to check the uniqueness of the content please do let the readers know. i hope this will help a lot of readers. reply chris lee may 16, 2016 at 5:42 pm yeah iwriter will be much better than fiverr. you can use copyscape for that. or you can even just copy and paste a few sentences into google to see if there’s a match. reply tom may 16, 2016 at 5:42 pm great post! i use iwriter religiously and have processed thousands of orders. here’s what i do to ensure i get the best results: create a gdoc and show them what the piece should look like. if your website follows a certain template and/or layout, this is a great way to hold their hand and show them. also, if you have an article you like, mention these. another commenter mentioned long-term jobs — mention this in your job. state that if you’re good, you will get private jobs. these writers love the private jobs and job security. keep a good approval score. my score is above 89% and i have more than 3,000+ orders. how do i keep my score so high? instead of rejecting, i will send revision requests constantly. if i have to send it more than three times, i will say this is their final revision. since so many writers want a good score, they will dump it back into the public pool. lastly, you touched on it, but say it’s going to be an informative piece, don’t worry about the keywords. you can get awesome pieces for $5. i’d say for about every 20 writers, i find one that’s awesome and they do stick around for quite some times. reply chris lee may 16, 2016 at 5:45 pm tom, these are great! thanks so much for sharing these. especially like the idea of providing examples to give layout, style, and template direction. really a useful tip. reply amandeep singh august 25, 2016 at 7:45 am interesting and helpful read, chris. what are your views about the blog network feature that iwriter has… cheers aman reply chris lee august 25, 2016 at 8:34 pm i wouldn’t recommend getting any links on blog networks that are so public. reply stuart march 9, 2017 at 9:49 am hi chris, do you know of any specialty content sources? for example: medical topics, bushcraft, survival, etc. thanks reply chris lee march 16, 2017 at 12:02 pm you can try upwork for that. reply les lieurance april 13, 2017 at 9:21 am great read chris. i can write great content for my site, but it takes a lot time to create a great post. i’m assuming you are heavily editing your article before you publish it? reply chris lee april 27, 2017 at 1:11 pm thanks les. yes, the heavy editing part is the downside with this strategy. reply tirupati august 9, 2017 at 1:04 am this article is very helpful. it has saved me a lot of time and money outsourcing articles. now i can easily explain to my writer what exactly i want on my blog. thank you, chris. reply chris lee august 12, 2017 at 12:35 am glad it was helpful! reply tainers september 18, 2017 at 10:06 am great piece chris, i think upwork has come in strongly and for those clients seeking high quality content, they can get it by hiring writers from this site. i am a writer and used to writer content through iwriter platform, little did i know that upwork is a much more senior site. the good thing with upwork is that you can have real time communication with writers to tell them what you exactly want see in your project. you can request samples even before allocating a job. however, this doesn’t mean that iwriter is a low-end platform for publishers, there are quality writers there. any serious publisher needing quality content may find me at upwork: id: tainers reply chris lee september 19, 2017 at 12:55 pm thanks for sharing your thoughts, tainers. i agree upwork is a better bet if you’re looking for quality work, long-term writers, and wouldn’t mind paying more. reply alok rana january 15, 2018 at 4:27 am great tips!! thanks chris, i am actually paying more to my direct contacts for writing jobs. i’m going to try iwriter pretty soon. and, i totally agree with the instruction thing you mentioned i even provide way more instructions to my writers. that way i kind of get a premium quality work from a random writer. tip: do ask your writer to add long tail keywords in the form of questions that really work amazingly with my strategy. as it’s good for both human and search engines. reply chris lee january 16, 2018 at 11:45 pm awesome! thanks for the added tip, alok 🙂 reply pavan solapure august 2, 2018 at 12:53 pm thanks, chris for this information. i am planning to use iwriter service for my technology blog. do you think there are writers on this platform who can research and write some technical contents? if you can direct me to some sample articles written by these writers, it will help me to prepare my view. reply chris lee august 9, 2018 at 3:05 pm i think for more technical articles, or ones that you care about the quality being really good, you should look into upwork or problogger – at the very least textbroker. reply danny hock january 8, 2019 at 12:56 pm been using iwriter for a while and never thought of telling them “this is not an seo article”. now i know. thanks man. by the way, what plugin are you using for your opt in box at the end of your article? thanks. reply ayman january 31, 2019 at 2:16 pm great tips. thanks chris. in my opinion, the more details you give the writer, the better the end result will be. instead of giving him just the keyword, try to include all the details like all the points you want him to address and the questions to answer in the article. i know it takes more work to do that, but it saves you a lot of time when you edit the article later on. it also makes the writer job a lot easier. reply chris lee february 3, 2019 at 11:54 am yes! great tips, ayman. reply neelu bala july 11, 2019 at 5:04 am i’m loving this strategy! i just signed up and literally copied all your text fields. hopefully my first article is as good as the ones you’re getting. $5 is quite a bargain. leave a reply cancel reply zero to 100k with seo a free 5-part seo email course that will show you step-by-step how to grow traffic from zero to 100,000 visitors per month (with search). sign up for free zero to 100k with seo a free 5-part seo email course that will show you step-by-step how to grow traffic from zero to 100,000 visitors per month (with search). sign me up © 2019 rankxl. all rights reserved. | contact | twitter zero to 100k with seo free 5-part mini-course. enter your email to get lesson #1. email* send me the first lesson enter your email below to get the zero to 100k mini-course email* send me the first lesson
