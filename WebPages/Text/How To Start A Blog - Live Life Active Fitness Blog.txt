mine is livelifeactive.com. pick something that will be easy to remember and as catchy as possible. head over to bluehost to see if your new domain name is available. if you don’t already have a domain name, fill out the “new domain” box. if you want to transfer your other domain to bluehost, use the “transfer domain” option. do you have a domain name name you’d like to buy? check the availability of it here. for this example, you’re probably going to choose the box on the left and then hit next. 2. set up your hosting account after you choose your domain name, you’ll need to host your website which is what bluehost is here for. hosting is where all the information that you write on your blog is stored. you have to pay for the storage space of your website. it’s kind of like renting a parking space each month. from here you will add your account information to set up your bluehost account and confirm your package information. next you will enter your payment information and create a hosting password. awesome news! bluehost recently changed the way this is all set up so now you won’t have to go through all the steps of installing wordpress on your bluehost website. it’s all done for you!!! at this point in the process, you would have normally had to do several more steps but boom, it’s done for you! magic! after you have set up your password, you will be able to choose a theme (this can be changed any time). this is going to be the overall look of your website. just pick a theme that looks appropriate to your site and you’re almost done! after a theme is selected, click the start building button or you can go to your dashboard from here. you will be taken to your bluehost dashboard. this is your “home” to your website and where you will do all of your customizations and page/post creations. if you ever want to make a change to what hosting plan you chose, you can do all of that from your bluehost account. bluehost is a very reliable website and has great prices. they will even give you your domain name for free if you buy hosting through them (i highly recommend bluehost). 3.) have fun and design your blog! you are now minutes away from creating your first blog post! how exciting, right?!?! now is the time where you can pick how you want your blog to look. you get to pick your theme! there are a ton of free wordpress themes available. if you want to have more customization options and have a more professional look than those that are offered for free, i’d highly recommend using a premium theme. the thesis theme is one that i would suggest. it is highly functional and customizable. it’s super easy to use! if you have any questions on how to start a blog , feel free to comment below or email me directly at erinstaysfit@gmail.com. i’d be glad to help you on your own blogging adventure 🙂 now is your chance to create a fitness, food or personal blog that will inspire others and hold you accountable for your goals! popular posts 1. eating clean grocery list – approved foods list 2. 101 gym quotes 3. how exercise can affect a woman’s menstrual cycle – live life active fitness blog 4. can you lose weight from hemorrhoid cream and saran wrap?
