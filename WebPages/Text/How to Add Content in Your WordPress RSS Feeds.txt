function wpbeginner_postrss($content) {
global $wp_query;
$postid = $wp_query->post->id;
$coolcustom = get_post_meta($postid, 'coolcustom', true);
if(is_feed()) {
if($coolcustom !== '') {
$content = $content."<br /><br /><div>".$coolcustom."</div>
";
}
else {
$content = $content;
}
}
return $content;
}
add_filter('the_excerpt_rss', 'wpbeginner_postrss');
add_filter('the_content', 'wpbeginner_postrss');
 now most of you are wondering how this code is functioning. so here is an explanation. we create a function called wpbeginner_postrss which runs a global wp_query to search in each post if a custom field called “coolcustom” is defined. if cool custom is defined then it shows the value after the post content. if there is no custom field defined, then the function by default shows just the post content and nothing else. we use the variable $content to display content. we are using if(is_feed) function and adding the custom text or other content to the main post content itself which you can see by the second filter. but it will only be displayed in the rss feeds due to our user of if(is_feed) function. by doing it this way, we avoid all the compatibility issues. some of you will say but you just did what rss footer plugin does with a function. yes and no. yes we are adding the code at the footer of the post, but this text is not the same exact text for each post. it is different because you specify different text for each post via custom fields. this trick will be very handy to comply with the new ftc guidelines for blogs that have all different type of posts. 2. adding additional text to post titles in rss does your blog have guest posts, sponsored posts, and review posts? well if you do then you will find this very useful. some bloggers have custom styling to display each different type of post, so their users can distinguish between them. but when these posts go in a reader, all the stylings are gone. that is when this trick comes in handy. in this trick we will add any text either before or after the title. for example if your title was “commercial wordpress theme – studiopress” and it was a sponsored post, then you can change it to “sponsored post: commercial wordpress theme – studiopress”. same if someone wrote a guest post etc. to accomplish this, open your functions.php file and add the following code in there: 
    function wpbeginner_titlerss($content) {
    global $wp_query;
    $postid = $wp_query->post->id;
    $gpost = get_post_meta($postid, 'guest_post', true);
    $spost = get_post_meta($postid, 'sponsored_post', true);

    if($gpost !== '') {
    $content = 'guest post: '.$content;
    }
    elseif ($spost !== ''){
    $content = 'sponsored post: '.$content;
    }
    else {
    $content = $content;
    }
    return $content;
    }
    add_filter('the_title_rss', 'wpbeginner_titlerss');
 explanation for the code: we are using the function called wpbeginner_titlerss which runs a global wp_query to search in each post if it contains either $gpost or $spost. these two elements are basically looking for two specific custom fields called “guest_post” or “sponsored_post”. if anyone has these custom fields added with a value true, then the code will add it in the text. if not then you will just see the normal title. you can see first the code looks for if $gpost is true, if that is not true whether $spost is true. if that is not also not defined, then it displays normal content. but if either one of them was true, then it displays the different text you specify here. we are using $content string to display the post title. now that was just displaying custom fields in the title. do you want to display category name on each title? well then you should simply paste the following code in your functions.php file: 
function wpbeginner_cattitlerss($content) {
$postcat = "";
foreach((get_the_category()) as $cat) {
$postcat .= ' ('.$cat->cat_name . ')';
}
$content = $content.$postcat;
return $content;
}
add_filter('the_title_rss', 'wpbeginner_cattitlerss');
 explanation: we are using the function wpbgeinner_cattitlerss to get the category id for each post and then displaying that right next to the title. so if the title is “get contact form 7” now it would be “get contact form 7 [plugins]”. you can see that there is no if then variable in this code. we use $content for the main title and $postcat variable to define the category name. you rearrange that if you like. 3. add same text on all posts in rss if you just want to add the same text then you might as well use the plugin called rss footer by joost because it is easier. but if you want to do it yourself this is how you do it. open your functions.php file add the following code: 
function wpbeginner_postrss($content) {
if(is_feed()){
$content = 'this post was written by syed balkhi '.$content.'check out wpbeginner';
}
return $content;
}
add_filter('the_excerpt_rss', 'wpbeginner_postrss');
add_filter('the_content', 'wpbeginner_postrss');
 explanation: we are calling a function wpbeginner_postrss to add in each post a content before the post saying this post was written by syed balkhi and after the content check out wpbeginner. but we add the function if(is_feed), so it will only be displayed in rss feeds. this would be very helpful if you wanted to sell ads on specific posts in rss, add custom ftc guidelines or just wanted to have more control over your rss feeds. source: we used joost’s rss footer plugin for a lot of guidance in writing this tutorial. the title rss hack part we got from a french tutorial site and we added our own variables and gave it the ability to be custom titles per custom field. 51 shares share tweet share pin popular on wpbeginner right now! how to install google analytics in wordpress for beginners how to fix the error establishing a database connection in wordpress checklist: 15 things you must do before changing wordpress themes how to properly move your blog from wordpress.com to wordpress.org about the editorial staff editorial staff at wpbeginner is a team of wordpress experts led by syed balkhi. trusted by over 1.3 million readers worldwide. 34 commentsleave a reply macca sherifi says: aug 5, 2014 at 8:57 am on your rss feed you’ve got a real simple “to leave a comment please visit [post title] on wpbeginner.” how do i replicate this?

reply editorial staff says: jun 27, 2013 at 9:47 am your feed doesn’t load your template’s css, so you would have to use inline css. reply matt says: dec 31, 2012 at 12:59 am i really appreciate you sharing this information with us. i have implemented this on my site now…i always really liked how it looks in your “weekly” emails that i receive. i think that it looks very professional and of course it is gonna help fight back against those content scrapers (thieves). again, well written code, and very useful advice. thank you! reply etienne bretteville says: aug 13, 2012 at 3:56 am do you know if this tweak is still working with wordpress 3.4.1?! can’t make it work. reply editorial staff says: aug 13, 2012 at 12:29 pm yes, it should still work with 3.4.1. reply adam says: apr 17, 2012 at 11:11 pm great info! one question… on #1 add a custom field to your wordpress rss footer, for some reason the content/custom field is displayed twice. any idea why?

reply thenerdynurse says: jun 11, 2011 at 9:53 pm now i can stick it to those content stealers! reply scot says: jan 6, 2011 at 9:41 pm hi, i’m looking to add two fields to my ‘full’ rss feed. one which displays the author of the post and the other which displays a list of the taxomonies, if any, that the post is in. so let’s say the author is johnr and the post is in the nfl, raiders and jets taxonomies, the rss would have two additional fields: johnr nfl, raiders, jets can someone point me in the right direction to get this done? – scot reply diane says: dec 3, 2010 at 8:18 am is there a way to find out who is subscribing to your rss feeds on wordpress? reply editorial staff says: dec 3, 2010 at 5:12 pm yes, you can use feedburner. in our beginner’s guide category we have a full article covering it. reply agilworld says: oct 29, 2010 at 5:47 pm thanks for sharing… your tutorial is useful to me for verify the technorati claim token! it worked nicely. i was looking for an effective way to verify it and found articles that discuss about that. but most of it, is not effective. and in the end, thought in my mind how add extra text in each footer post rss feeds, great! i found a smart way through your article, thanks!! reply juri says: oct 7, 2010 at 6:43 pm hi, your code to add custom fields to rss works great!!!! thanks! i’m wondering if there is a way to edit the position and not to show the custom fields in the footer but above the title, or under the title, or etc… is there a chance to add the tag “style” and so use some css? thank you very much reply juri says: oct 7, 2010 at 2:36 pm add a custom field to your wordpress rss footer: thanks your code works perfectly. i have a question: how can i edit the position to show custom field up before the title or just after the title? i tried to edit the code here: $content = $content.””.$coolcustom.” “; i can remove the br tags and it works but where can i add style and css? thanks for your great help reply editorial staff says: oct 10, 2010 at 9:55 am you would have to use inline styling for the rss to work on all different readers. to add it before, you will add it like $coolcustom.$content and then add div tags using quotation where you like… reply robert simpson says: sep 12, 2010 at 4:27 pm hi, i’m trying to find a way to use a custom field to exclude a post from the rss feed. any ideas? cheers, robert reply editorial staff says: sep 15, 2010 at 6:45 am the easiest solution would be to post it in a separate category and exclude that category from rss feeds with the use of advanced category plugin… reply zach says: jun 15, 2010 at 9:02 am hey, thanks for the tutorial. it worked perfectly. had a quick question though – after i get the extra content to load into the rss feed (for example if i’m viewing it in safari), when i actually embed the rss feed on a website, that extra info goes away. do you have any idea why that would happen? it’s been about 4 days as well – and i’ve tried clearing my cache several times. thanks! reply kiki says: mar 10, 2010 at 2:58 am thanks for this so far! i haven’t been able to find much on adding custom fields to the rss feed until now. would it be difficult to add multiple custom fields with the code from section 1? i have an event listing website with custom fields for each post i want to display in the rss, i.e. “venue,” “event date,” “address,” et al. reply editorial staff says: mar 10, 2010 at 6:05 am you should be able to add as many custom fields that you want without any problem reply kiki says: mar 11, 2010 at 2:28 pm sorry, i’m a bit of a novice, but what would the code look like to get the multiple custom fields. i’ve tried playing with a few configurations of the code so far but it keeps resulting in errors. one field is working great though! reply ajay says: feb 6, 2010 at 4:14 am i had a plugin released a while back that eases this process: http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/add-to-feed/ reply editorial staff says: feb 6, 2010 at 8:21 am ajay but does your plugin allows one to add custom fields in the rss text? because it just seems like that it has the exact same functionality that joost’s rss footer plugin has which is not what this article is showing. what if you need to display different ftc texts for each post, then plugins like yours and rss footer would fail because they show the same text on each post. with this, one can set different ways: for example, if custom field this: display that otherwise display the default copyright or something like that. reply topan says: jan 31, 2010 at 4:43 pm i grab your rss. ho ho ho. let me begin to do this tutorial on my own :confuse: reply faqpal says: jan 29, 2010 at 8:40 am good ideas and post. thanks for the share. made it our featured tutorial at faqpal. reply oscar says: jan 28, 2010 at 12:19 pm this is great, it should help out a lot when trying to do quick little customizations. little bite-sized tips like this are very helpful. i’ve seen people put some of the social media icons at the bottom too, to add to digg, and su and stuff. reply john (human3rror) says: jan 27, 2010 at 8:05 am great! thanks for this. very helpful. reply leave a reply cancel reply thanks for choosing to leave a comment. please keep in mind that all comments are moderated according to our comment policy, and your email address will not be published. please do not use keywords in the name field. let's have a personal and meaningful conversation. don't subscribe all replies to my comments notify me of followup comments via e-mail. you can also subscribe without commenting. over 1,320,000+ readers get fresh content from wpbeginner featured wordpress plugin wpforms drag & drop wordpress form builder plugin. learn more » i need help with ... starting a blog wordpress performance wordpress security wordpress seo wordpress errors building an online store useful wordpress guides 7 best wordpress backup plugins compared (pros and cons) how to fix the error establishing a database connection in wordpress why you need a cdn for your wordpress blog?
