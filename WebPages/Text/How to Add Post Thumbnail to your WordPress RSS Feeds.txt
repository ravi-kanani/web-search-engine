function rss_post_thumbnail($content) {
global $post;
if(has_post_thumbnail($post->id)) {
$content = '<p>' . get_the_post_thumbnail($post->id) .
'</p>' . get_the_content();
}
return $content;
}
add_filter('the_excerpt_rss', 'rss_post_thumbnail');
add_filter('the_content_feed', 'rss_post_thumbnail');

reply araujo, luiz says: dec 12, 2016 at 2:01 pm hello, how can i apply this filter in a custom rss i have the following rss created add_action(‘init’, ‘customrss’); function customrss(){ add_feed(‘feedname’, ‘customrssfunc’); } function customrssfunc(){ get_template_part(‘rss’, ‘feedname’); } great job reply steffi says: oct 24, 2016 at 9:54 am i pasted the code in wp functions now, my side is crashed. white screen. can not log in. helppp!!!! reply wpbeginner support says: oct 24, 2016 at 6:06 pm you will need to connect to your website using an ftp client. then locate the functions.php file (you will find it in /wp-content/themes/your-theme-folder/), edit the file using a plain text editor like notepad. undo the changes you made earlier. finally, save the file and upload it back. you may also want to see our wordpress troubleshooting guide. reply bolkya resha says: sep 14, 2016 at 4:03 am i tried same for my site but rss feed not showing images,plz help reply wpbeginner support says: sep 14, 2016 at 7:02 pm rss feed is an xml file. usually when you are viewing an xml file in a browser it will only show you the code and will not execute the markup. you need to check your feed into a feed reader like feedly. reply natalie says: may 6, 2016 at 8:00 am is it possible to use this function with the wp rss widget? i need to imports posts with thumbnails to another site. reply suresh khanal says: apr 16, 2016 at 10:07 am it was really a headache to see the rss-to-email campaigns without no images because the rss feed did not have the necessary tag to pull images from. anyway, changed the functions.php file and now mailchimp can pull the required components and now the emails look beautiful. however, still the images in rss feed look really big and wish to resize them to a suitable size. needs to search more and find a solution for this. reply elodie says: aug 20, 2015 at 11:54 am thank you it crashed my site! reply jeremy r. hammond says: dec 9, 2014 at 11:05 am this accomplished getting the thumbnail included in the feed, but created two other problems: 1) my feed now shows the full content instead of just the summary. 2) the feed is also capturing my featured image from the content (the full image, not just the thumbnail) and this shortcode: [caption id="attachment_24496" align="aligncenter"width="739"]caption text[/caption] i assume there’s a way to correct both of these problems. can anyone assist? reply gretchen louise says: nov 29, 2014 at 7:05 pm thank you so much for this code! any suggestions for editing it so that the post thumbnail is a link to the post itself? reply keifer moore says: may 29, 2014 at 3:45 pm i tried to implement this and received “parse error: syntax error, unexpected ‘<' in /home/content/98/8201898/html/wp-content/themes/twentyfourteen/functions.php on line 526" i can't access wp-admin or the rss feed. i've tried making new wp-config.php files and nothing's working. could someone help? reply salvatore capolupo says: may 10, 2014 at 6:35 am great help, thank you reply i plank says: apr 24, 2014 at 4:49 am thanx a lot. it works reply benjamin says: apr 22, 2014 at 3:55 am hi whoever wrote this post. thanks at first, but when using this code, my feed displays the image in full size, not as a thumbnail. what would you recommend to define a size? reply vijay saklani says: feb 25, 2014 at 3:05 am hi, i am new to wordpress. can you suggest me how can i use this one to show rss fedd with thumbs. here is my code: get_item_quantity( 10 ); // build an array of all the items, starting with element 0 (first element). $rss_items = $rss->get_items( 0, $maxitems ); endif; ?> <a href="get_permalink() ); ?>” title=”get_date(‘j f y | g:i a’) ); ?>”> get_title($content,) ); ?> get_description() ); ?> and add the describe function in function.php of theme. but not working. help me!!!! thnaks reply françois says: jan 29, 2014 at 11:14 am hello, thanks you for sharing this! i’d like to know if this is possible (and how) to use this script to display author image in rss feed? is there a way to do this ? thanks françois reply kama says: jan 21, 2014 at 8:53 pm why we need check has_post_thumbnail()? get_the_post_thumbnail() return empty string if it couldn’t get thumbnail. also, no need to define global $post. filters calling from inside the loop. and why we call get_the_content(), is it nessesary? this code will enaugh: — function rss_post_thumbnail( $content ){ $img = get_the_post_thumbnail( null, array(100, 80), array( ‘align’ => ‘left’, ‘style’ => ‘margin-right:15px;’ ) ); $content = $img . $content; return $content; } add_filter( ‘the_excerpt_rss’, ‘rss_post_thumbnail’ ); add_filter( ‘the_content_feed’, ‘rss_post_thumbnail’ ); — sorry for my english. it’s not my native. reply abhay singh says: jun 27, 2013 at 6:23 am hello sir, i have added code on functions.php but thumbnail not showing reply brett bumeter says: nov 1, 2012 at 11:18 pm trying this with the genesis magazine theme, no luck. the article is getting a wee bit dated. i was wondering if something might have changed in wordpress since this was originally written, or if maybe i’m just missing something. been a while since i wondered down the rabbit hole chasing feed code /** add thumbnail to magazine theme feed*/ function rss_post_thumbnail($content) { global $post; if(has_post_thumbnail($post->id)) { $content = ” . ‘id).'”>’. get_the_post_thumbnail($post->id).’‘ . ” . /* full content option get_the_content() */get_the_excerpt();/*exercpt option */ } return $content; } add_filter(‘the_excerpt_rss’, ‘rss_post_thumbnail’); add_filter(‘the_content_feed’, ‘rss_post_thumbnail’); reply editorial staff says: nov 6, 2012 at 10:33 am just tested the code from the article on a custom genesis child theme. it works fine. it won’t work with the default wordpress feed that firefox shows. but if you go to the atom feed, then it will work. if you are using a feedburner or another app, it should work. reply nick aster says: jul 3, 2012 at 7:38 pm ok…. wait a minute. looks like this forces my rss feed to be full content. is that the case? more importantly, it looks like all this does is slap the tumbnail at the beginning of the content in the rss feed. am i missing something here? reply editorial staff says: jul 4, 2012 at 3:38 am yes, it does make the feed full content. you can change get_the_content() to get_the_excerpt(). yes, the point is to add the featured thumbnail in rss. in most cases, that is added before the post. you can style the paragraph tag however you like. add a float:left; or anything that you want. reply shen says: jan 6, 2012 at 7:02 pm 10x .. it’s work perfectly reply eribowo says: dec 23, 2011 at 7:46 pm is this working for rss reader wordpress widget…?? i looking for way to insert thumbnails image in rss widget..anyone..? reply laksh says: oct 30, 2011 at 8:00 am hi i tried this but it gives error fatal error: call to undefined function add_filter() in wp-includes/functions.php on line 33 . please help me to solve this porblem. thanx in advance. reply andyibm says: jun 25, 2011 at 6:09 am this works great, except that when there is a thumbnail present, the feed always repeats the post title within the content text (or excerpt text, as i’m using), which looks a little redundant. for posts without a thumbnail, the title is not repeated. is there any way of removing this extra title text? it has no surrounding tags, so i can’t hide it using css. reply piotr sajnog says: apr 5, 2011 at 12:52 pm is there anyway to align post thumbnails to the left of the entry in rss feed? reply editorial staff says: apr 5, 2011 at 1:25 pm yes, add styling to it. change the paragraph tag into a div and tell it to float left with some margin. reply azzepis says: jun 14, 2010 at 3:16 am i think it’s better if you change code: $content=”.get_the_post_thumbnail($post->id).”.$content; to maintain the original content. reply meg says: jan 20, 2011 at 9:14 am so what would the final code – all of it – look like? non-coder who wants a thumbnail in her blog feed. reply editorial staff says: jan 20, 2011 at 9:38 am the code in the article is the final code that you need… ofcourse if your theme doesn’t have thumbnail enabled, then you will need more. reply cosmin says: may 17, 2010 at 3:06 pm how would you make the post thumbnail link from rss to the post? i don’t get along with php, any help is appreciated reply editorial staff says: may 17, 2010 at 3:22 pm you would modify the function a little bit. add this php code in the link tag: the_permalink($post->id) reply jake says: may 16, 2010 at 5:50 pm this is really something! i would love to add something like this to inside the webb, i’ll have to mess around with some code and see what i can do. reply leave a reply cancel reply thanks for choosing to leave a comment. please keep in mind that all comments are moderated according to our comment policy, and your email address will not be published. please do not use keywords in the name field. let's have a personal and meaningful conversation. don't subscribe all replies to my comments notify me of followup comments via e-mail. you can also subscribe without commenting. over 1,320,000+ readers get fresh content from wpbeginner featured wordpress plugin seedprod jump start your website with viral coming soon pages. learn more » i need help with ... starting a blog wordpress performance wordpress security wordpress seo wordpress errors building an online store useful wordpress guides 7 best wordpress backup plugins compared (pros and cons) how to fix the error establishing a database connection in wordpress why you need a cdn for your wordpress blog?
