<?php
$category = get_category( get_query_var('cat') );

if ( ! empty( $category ) )

echo '<div class="category-feed"><p><a href="' . get_category_feed_link( $category->cat_id ) . '" title="subscribe to this category" rel="nofollow">subscribe</a></p></div>';
?>
 if your does not have a category.php file, but it has an archive.php file, then create a new file called category.php and paste all the code from archive.php in it. once you are done, then paste the above code in it. by adding the above code, you will be able to see a subscribe link on your category archive page like so: this code simply adds a link with the anchor text ‘subscribe’ to the template. you can get fancy by adding an rss icon instead of text if you prefer. all you have to do is replace the “subscribe” text with an image url like so: 
<img src="http://example.com/location/to/rss/icon.png" width="48" height="48" alt="subscribe" />
 an example subscription icon would look like this: adding other subscription options for categories in wordpress while most users who use a rss reader already have the browser extension installed, but it can never hurt to add familiar icons to ease the process. for the sake of example, we will add buttons for two popular web based rss reader apps, feedly and bloglines. you can use the same technique to add other services if you like. below is the sample code that you would need to add to your category.php file: 
<?php
$category = get_category( get_query_var('cat') );

if ( ! empty( $category ) )

echo '<div class="category-feed"><p>subcribe via: <a href="' . get_category_feed_link( $category->cat_id ) . '" title="subscribe to this category" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://example.com/location/to/rss/icon.png" width="32" height="32" alt="subscribe" /></a>


<a href="http://www.feedly.com/home#subscription/feed/' . get_category_feed_link( $category->cat_id ) . '" title="subscribe via feedly" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://example.com/location/to/feedly/icon.png" width="32" height="32" alt="subscribe" /></a>


<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/sub/' . get_category_feed_link( $category->cat_id ) . '" title="subscribe via bloglines" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://example.com/location/to/bloglines/icon.png" width="32" height="32" alt="subscribe" /></a>

</p></div>';
?>
 as you can see, we have modified the category feed links for the last two icons. the first icon still points to your original rss feed, but the second and third icon takes the users to feedly and bloglines, so they can subscribe to the category feed. this is how it looked on our test site: adding email subscription for categories in wordpress when users look at our sidebar subscription option, they think each of those checkboxes are categories. while they are not categories, the concept of adding category specific subscription is very similar. to add email subscription for categories, you would need to utilize a third-party email subscription service like mailchimp or aweber. both of these companies have a feature called rss to email. you would need to create a list segment aka groups, and then use those in combination with rss to email feature to accomplish email subscription for wordpress categories. we have created already written a guide on how to create a daily and weekly newsletter in wordpress which highlights all the same concepts. please check that out to learn how to create groups and setup rss to email campaign. the only difference is that you will have to create a rss to email campaign and groups for each individual category. this is why it is very important that you are using categories the right way. next, simply copy and paste your form code on your category pages using the same method as the codes above. there is so much more you can do with your category rss feeds. see our tutorial on how to add content in your wordpress rss feeds and totally manipulate them. we hope that this article helped you in adding subscription options for your wordpress categories. if you have any questions or suggestions, then please let us know by leaving a comment below. 66 shares share tweet share pin popular on wpbeginner right now! how to fix the error establishing a database connection in wordpress how to properly move your blog from wordpress.com to wordpress.org how to install google analytics in wordpress for beginners revealed: why building an email list is so important today (6 reasons) about the editorial staff editorial staff at wpbeginner is a team of wordpress experts led by syed balkhi. trusted by over 1.3 million readers worldwide. 20 commentsleave a reply devesh pal says: jun 27, 2017 at 12:19 pm first of all, huge fan of your site, very informative, thanks for your service again! situation with me is my website has lets say 5 categories in total and the requirement is to display them all, now user can subscribe to any of 5 categories that he/she wish to. what i have done so far, i have created a subscribe option for all my blogs using feeds but not specific to categories. can you please help me in the same! please do reply! many thanks for your support so far and in advance! reply wpbeginner support says: jun 27, 2017 at 1:50 pm hi davesh, each category on your blog has its own rss feed too. you can use that rss feed and create a subscribe option just like you did for your main blog feeds. please check out the article above for more details. reply devesh says: jun 27, 2017 at 5:37 pm okay! so can i merge all category’s feed and display only one subscribe input which can show options for selecting either one or more/all categories?

cheers karen reply brenda says: sep 19, 2013 at 1:15 am is there any way to do this with custom taxonomies? reply wpbeginner support says: sep 19, 2013 at 10:55 pm yes the basic instructions are the same, use get_term_feed_link( $term_id, $taxonomy = 'customtaxonomyname', $feed = 'rss2' ) instead of get_category_feed_link() function. reply swapnali says: jul 17, 2013 at 4:30 am hieee, this tutorial is awesome… thanks.. was finding very difficult to get category subscription for users. find your tutorial and work was done in just few minutes. thanks once again. i want to ask one thing i am using free mailchimp, does it will cretae any problem? reply kimberly says: jun 28, 2013 at 9:52 am nice tutorial, thanks so much. reply marc a. flego says: jun 28, 2013 at 1:23 am first off, i absolutely love this website! second, i have a question… what if you want to display these very same category subscribe links on your main blog page or even on a single blog post? i assumed that it would consist of the same code being integrated into blog.php and single.php but that’s not the case – the links appear, but they do not direct correctly when clicked. anyone else tried this? reply editorial staff says: jun 28, 2013 at 7:57 am hey marc, the easiest solution would be to use your category url/feed/ manually. on other pages, $category variable is not available by default. also wp_list_categories function has the option to display all categories with feed links. http://codex.wordpress.org/template_tags/wp_list_categories reply marc a. flego says: jun 28, 2013 at 4:20 pm hmm, so there’s no variable category feed url which can be linked to different blog posts? i would have thought that to be a fairly basic function in wordpress. if a blog post can display a category tag beside it, why can it not display a link to that feed on the same page? maybe i’m missing something… reply badar ul islam says: jun 27, 2013 at 6:21 am this tutorial is super duper useful for people having alot of categories in their blog or website especially having more then 1 niche in their website. reply tuan vo says: jun 26, 2013 at 12:29 am awesome!!! very very very very useful post reply zach smith says: jun 25, 2013 at 2:37 pm this was actually informative – not like most of what i see online. sharing reply leave a reply cancel reply thanks for choosing to leave a comment. please keep in mind that all comments are moderated according to our comment policy, and your email address will not be published. please do not use keywords in the name field. let's have a personal and meaningful conversation. don't subscribe all replies to my comments notify me of followup comments via e-mail. you can also subscribe without commenting. over 1,320,000+ readers get fresh content from wpbeginner featured wordpress plugin seedprod jump start your website with viral coming soon pages. learn more » i need help with ... starting a blog wordpress performance wordpress security wordpress seo wordpress errors building an online store useful wordpress guides 7 best wordpress backup plugins compared (pros and cons) how to fix the error establishing a database connection in wordpress why you need a cdn for your wordpress blog?
