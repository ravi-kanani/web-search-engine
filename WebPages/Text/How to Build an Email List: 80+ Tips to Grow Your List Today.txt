1. host a giveaway everyone loves a giveaway, so you might as well use the excitement and momentum of a giveaway to help build up your email list. besides requiring participants to sign up with their own emails, you can add another incentive by rewarding those who share your giveaway on various social media platforms additional entries. keep in mind: the bigger the prize, the greater the participation and be certain that you are receiving valid email addresses with each entry. # 2. free content page most of us don’t use up all of the space that we are allowed from our domain carrier, so there is the potential to expand into publishing an additional web page or two. load up the extra web page with tons of free content that can only be accessed by those who opt-in with their valid email address. keep in mind: the content on these extra pages needs to be closely related to your lead magnet in order to boost the overall search engine rank of your site with relevant keywords # 3. mobile app signup with the prevalence of smartphones in today’s world, mobile apps have become one of the best tools for driving traffic to your website. you can utilize this major avenue to grow your email list as well by requiring a valid email when signing up or signing into your mobile app. keep in mind: your mobile app needs to actually be useful and it is best if it is directly related to the type of goods and services you provide. # 4. offer a challenge just like issuing a dare, offering a challenge motivates people to step up and do things they might not do otherwise; like pour a bucket of ice water over their head. the challenge can include some sort of giveaway or reward for showing up logging in or commenting on posts for a certain number of days or some other type of challenge, but should certainly require an email address to enter. keep in mind: the more creative and fun you make the challenge the higher participation you will attract. # 5. email only offers when you ship package, send out postcards or correspond through various types of mailings, be sure to add special offers to the printed materials. just attach a single condition to receiving the special offer; a valid email address. keep in mind: the offer needs to have significant value attached to it and needs to be very prominent so that people don’t toss it in the trash without even seeing it. #

7. birthday or anniversary club birthdays and anniversaries are milestones that everyone celebrates. everybody likes to be recognized on their birthday or anniversary. starting a birthday and/or anniversary club, which allows customers to receive a special reward, gift or discount on their birthday or anniversary, if they signup using their email is one more method you can use. keep in mind: be reasonable, but not cheap if you want solid participation. # 8. loyalty rewards why should credit cards, airlines and grocery stores have all the fun? you can develop you own type of loyalty rewards program for regular, loyal customers to encourage regular purchases. of course, they’ll have to sign up for the program using a valid email address. keep in mind: offer about 10 times the points typically awarded for a purchase whenever the individual signs up. # 9. speaking engagements speaking engagements are a great way to promote yourself and what you do. whenever you do them, be certain to have some sort of printed material, like an outline of your talk to hand out as you speak. of course, you will want to include a link to your opt-in page, qr code or written opt-in to get those emails. keep in mind: be sure to mention the value of being on your mailing list to receive further updates related to the topic you are speaking about. #

11. business cards qr codes are a bit of technology that make it extremely easy for users to opt-in to your email system. qr codes allow the user to scan the code and automatically transfer certain data without any further effort. place them on your business cards and have them set up to opt-in with an email address. keep in mind: you will need a code generator and the code will have to be a clear printed copy in order to work right. #

13. text message signup getting someone to call in and give out their email to sign up for your email list is much less likely to happen than… well, just about anything else. consequently, if you are making use of a podcast or television interview as a means of promoting your business, be sure to provide a means for potential customers to opt-in to your email list via text messaging. keep in mind: you will want to set up an automated confirmation system that will sort out all of those new email addresses you receive. # 14. email signature more and more people are figuring out that the email signature at the bottom of every email you send out is a great way to subtly promote your business. this tactic works best when you use your own professional business email address. that same email signature can also drive individuals toward your opt-in landing page where you can get them to sign up using their email address. keep in mind: your email signature needs to be simple, easy to read and attractive enough to attention for this to work. # 15. encourage forwarding having other duplicate your work is one of the best ways to leverage yourself. one way to accomplish this when it comes to obtaining emails is to provide forwarding buttons at the bottom of your newsletters and other email correspondence. include the phrase “forward to a friend,” on the button to get the best results. keep in mind: do not be tempted to add the forwarded email to your list, because that is spamming, but do be sure to always include an opt-in link in all of your emails and newsletters, even if the recipient is already on your list. # 16. social media sharing social media is the largest platform to reach the most people. if you occasionally share your email archives with friends and followers on social media, you can allow them a look into what they may be missing by not being a subscriber and encourage them to sign up to your email list. keep in mind: you want to give away enough to draw attention, but not give it all away without the person leaving social media and coming to your opt-in or magnet page. resources: guide to the best social media management tools #

23. twitter chats a great way to promote a live discussion that is related to products and services you provide is through twitter chat. if you make use of your lead magnet to create the twitter chat subject, you can draw participants into subscribing to your email list. keep in mind: you will need a solid understanding of twitter chatting to be successful. # 24. google+ communities another way to engage other into the goods and services you provide is through creating google+ communities that revolve around or are related to your area of expertise. make certain that your opt-in form is made available to all who participate in your communities as well. keep in mind: knowing and understanding the ins and outs of google+ communities is essential to make this work. # 25. foursquare the foursquare app is another avenue to obtain additional email subscribers. this search and discovery service not only directs people to the location of your physical business, if you have one, but you can post alerts about your business to potential customers in your area and include a link to your opt-in form as well. keep in mind: navigating through foursquare will require an understanding of this app, how it works and whether it is used in your area. #

27. facebook cover facebook provides you with two places to make sure that your opt-in logging page link is seen by everyone who comes to visit your page. place your opt-in link on both your cover photo and your background photo. keep in mind: you need solid contrast in colors that draws the eyes to the link. # 28. sandwich boards when you have a brick and mortar location as well as a web presence one way of encouraging email signups is by using sandwich boards out on the sidewalk or in front of your store in a mall or shopping center. provide the link to your opt-in page there and you might even offer a discount or bonus of some kind for subscribing. keep in mind: you can even print a qr code and place it on the sandwich board for quicker access. # 29. fishbowl approach another physical location based approach to use is to ask customers to place their email address in the fishbowl in order to win a prize. a great way to do this is to have them write their email address on the back of their receipt. keep in mind: you made need to have the capacity to provide a second receipt if you use the receipt approach. # 30. newsletter previews at physical locations, you can also distribute several printed copies of your newsletter around your place of business in order for your customers to get a preview of what they’re missing when they don’t sign up. of course, you will also include a link to your opt-in page or a qr code. keep in mind: if your current newsletter is always available, then there will not be a need to subscribe. in addition, what is included in the newsletter will need to be valuable information as well. # 31. target with lead magnets if your business offers a wide variety of goods and services, but can be divided into segments of interest, you might want to use lead magnet targeting. essentially, the popup for email subscription provides the customer or potential customer with a variety of choices concerning which information they want to receive. keep in mind: the options will need to be clearly distinct and you will want to send out specialized information to match each segment. # 32. anti-spam policy one reason that individuals fail to sign up for email subscriptions is because they don’t want to have their email spread around or sold to other who might send them spam. encouraging your customers and potential customers that their email is 100% secure on your site will help eliminate this common objection. keep in mind: your anti-spam policy should be easy to see and located immediately adjacent to the space where the users’ email address is submitted. # 33. opt-in checkbox if you utilize various services and apps for checkout, you are often allowed to add an opt-in checkbox at final checkout. often times, you have already requested the customer’s email address in order to send them a receipt, but it is important that you also ask them to opt-in rather than just assume that you have the green light to send them email. keep in mind: this checkbox works best at checkout, but it can also be included in the receipt email, just be sure it is very clearly displayed and the customer knows they are subscribing. # 34. simplify the form people are busy and rarely have time to sort through a drawn out signup process. you might have a lot of things you want to share with your customer but your opt-in form is not the place to do it. keep the for short and simple. keep in mind: three lines (what it is, provide email box, spam policy) and a button are plenty for an opt-in form. you can add information to the confirmation email if necessary. # 35. relatable opt-in copy any copy that you use to drive customers and potential customers toward your opt-in button needs to be clearly relatable and easily understood. using a lot of technical jargon or corporate speak is going to work against you when it comes to opt-in objectives. keep in mind: if you have too much jargon in your opt-in copy, people are going to assume that they’ll get more of the same in email updates. # 36. credibility you have to be a credible source for the information you intend to share. when it comes to email signups, users must be convinced that you really are legitimate and not just trying to build up an email list to send out spam. keep in mind: credibility is built through content and does not always come overnight. # 37. testimonials one way to help support #36 is through the use of testimonials from some of your current subscribers or customers. when potential subscribers see what others have to say about you, it is a boost of confidence for them to sign up. keep in mind: that the testimonials you use need to be real and you need to reward the people who agree to provide them. # 38. social proof we’ve all heard about how bad peer pressure can be, but you can use peer pressure to your advantage. including a counter or regularly updating the number of people who have already subscribed to your list can be an effective way to get others to follow suit. keep in mind: this probably isn’t a good idea if you only have a handful of current subscribers as low numbers will make you look weak. # 39. add opt-in for comments registration if you include a blog on your website and it draws people to comment, you have another way of getting people to opt-in. when users register in order to make comments on your blog, be sure to include an opt-in checkbox along with the registration form. keep in mind: you will also want to include an opt-in option attached to the confirmation email you send out, just in case you missed them the first time around. # 40. page specific opt-in form mixing things up a little bit can sometimes draw attention to your opt-in form. repeating or using the same opt-in form design on every page can cause users to just skim right over it. by changing the design and making the opt-in form fit whatever page it is on, you have a better chance of avoiding this issue. keep in mind: your lead magnet should be a perfect match to the content the visitor is currently reading on the page they are reading. # 41. prominent header if your call to action is lost inside the text of the content, then users will probably miss it. be sure that your call to action is a prominent header which stands out on the page rather than gets lost in the rest of the text. keep in mind: most people scan and skim through the content on a page and will miss an opt-in call to action if it is not prominently displayed in a way that breaks up their skimming. #

44. embedded forms if individuals are making a regular appearance on your site to read blog posts, then take advantage of their presence and get them to sign up. embedded forms above or below blog post content is one way to draw readers to opt-in keep in mind: you want your opt-in tags to match the specific content of the blog post to make this work best. # 45. timed lightbox popup when you provide heavy content which tends to keep users engaged in reading your content for an extended period of time, you might consider a timed popup opt-in form. these forms appear after the reader has had a chance to really get into your content, which means that you are already providing them with valuable information. keep in mind: interrupting someone who is concentrating can be irritating, so make certain your form is simple, to the point and can be easily gotten rid of so the reader can get back to the content. # 46. scroll box long form content can also benefit from the use of scroll boxes when it comes to achieving opt-in objectives. a scroll box stays out of the readers way while they read, but follows them down the page so that they don’t have to search for an opt-in form when they finish reading. keep in mind: this approach is sometimes better than times lightbox approach because it does not interrupt the reader. # 47. exit popup we’ve all heard stories of the one that got away and a lot of us have told them as well. if you want one more opportunity to get a user to sign up before leaving your site, an exit popup is an approach you will want to consider. keep in mind: this has to provide the best possible approach you can deliver, because once the visitor is gone… well, they’re just gone. #
