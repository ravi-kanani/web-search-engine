p { 
font-size:16px; 
}

what am i missing? thanks. reply darlene says: nov 13, 2018 at 11:14 am my old wp theme appears to have coded heading 1 in 12 pt font like normal text. i manually change each heading to 14 pt. but then the coding doesn’t say “h1” which google robots look for. if i use your plugin(which is cool) and change heading font sizes, will they still be labeled h1, h2, h3? also, i don’t want to change fonts on pages already customized. can i apply the plugin to blog posts only? thanks. reply wpbeginner support says: nov 13, 2018 at 8:08 pm hi darlene, you can give plugin a try. however, if your headings are hard coded in the theme then this may not help you change those headings. reply danny says: may 22, 2018 at 2:30 am the use of px (or pt) in this guide is not recommendable, because on small screens like on smartphones the font size is very small. its better to use em. reply fred lalonde says: jun 5, 2018 at 8:38 am how do i change the font size of menu items? reply tuan says: mar 25, 2018 at 11:23 pm hi, my fontsize is % not pt, how can i change it back to pt? reply pradeep says: feb 21, 2018 at 11:36 am fantastic… i just did it… thank a lot reply andrew oliver says: jan 20, 2018 at 12:46 pm i want to enlarge excel spreadsheets in my posts. i snip them and upload them via add media. but i don’t see a way to increase the font size of these uploads. so…. i increased the font size in my spreadsheet and then snipped and uploaded the spreadsheet with the larger font – but it still appears as the original size. is there any way to increase the font size in the post as it currently is too small to be easily read (there are several columns in my spreadsheet)? reply wpbeginner support says: jan 22, 2018 at 4:11 am hi andrew, we are not sure we fully understand your question. if you are uploading your spreadsheet as an image file, then its dimensions will depend on your post container. let’s suppose your post container or content area is 600px wide, then your theme will automatically shrink the image to fit in the container. you can also try selecting full size image before inserting it into your post. reply mylene says: apr 25, 2018 at 8:22 am hi, thanks for sharing, very useful indeed. is there a way to also adjust the font size of the title, or maybe better done in css (and if so, how)? thanks again! reply jackson says: dec 2, 2017 at 10:33 am i use tinymcv plugin to change the font size. but when i press enter and go to the next line the font size will be default value which is 9pt. how can i change the default value to 12pt. reply jitendra says: nov 8, 2017 at 4:20 am thanks for the post. but i want to know more… i want to make the bigger size of some special word in a sentence without any plugin. special words in a sentence. e.g. we are doing in ms word. can it possible? hope your answer. reply pragati kumar sheel says: jan 12, 2018 at 8:52 am hi jitendra to do that open your text editor. and type “font-size: 120%;” for example: your text you can change the font % by any value. i hope it will help you. reply brady says: sep 20, 2017 at 2:27 pm thanks for the video and info, but i can’t change single lines of font sizes when writing a blog post. in visual editor when i select “heading 1” or “heading 2” it changes the entire entry, but i only need to change that one line. i have to double space to make that happen without changing everything else. but then the spacing is wrong because it doesn’t need to be double spaced. please help. and is there any other way to change font by font size (11, 12, 14, etc) instead of the preselected “heading 1” “heading 2”, etc.? because tinymce didn’t work for me. thanks! reply veonescu ghe says: aug 25, 2017 at 6:16 am what are you talking about, wordpress? just make a simple option to increase the font size! not widgets that don’t work with some themes or they work for one paragraph etc. because the paragraph tab give either too small a font, or weirdly formatted, hard to read. why is it so hard to just add an option to increase the size wit a button?… reply theresa says: dec 15, 2017 at 7:47 am not kidding. this should not be this difficult. every time i hit return it reverts back to the original size. do i really have to select the font size for every single paragraph? reply salman qureshi says: aug 22, 2017 at 10:28 am tinymce advance has conflict with visual composer, reply liv ramirez says: aug 20, 2017 at 7:31 am hi. thank you. i am learning how to edit font size, font type and spacing. this is a big help. reply anna says: aug 20, 2017 at 5:09 am hi, first of all thank you for all the knowlege available on this site. it’s great ! i followed instructions from this article, but i still can’t change to font size in headers. i installed both tinymce and google fonts. i am able to change font styles but not the size. thank you, anna reply chidi anslem says: may 16, 2017 at 12:31 am thanks for this great post. it worked for me. i can now edit font family, change font size, underline text, highlight text and even insert table. thanks. reply philip says: may 13, 2017 at 3:26 pm i just updated my site and theme. i am having a weird issue of my woocommerce product titles having bigger fonts than they were before updates. i have tried custom css from other forums and wondering if maybe i can get an option here.. kindly advise. reply wpbeginner support says: may 13, 2017 at 6:15 pm hey philip, have you tested your website with different browsers and devices to make sure that it is not an issue with your browser settings. after that try reaching out to your theme developer, they will be able to tell you whats changed in the new version or if there is a better way to solve this issue. reply thomas says: apr 6, 2017 at 12:19 am is there a simple way to set a new default font size in wp? i have been manually setting to a larger font to improve readability but the theme doesn’t like it and tends to revert back to default whenever i press enter and also the paragraph headings don’t work when i’m inside text with the new size. i’d have thought this would have been one of the first features to include in wp themes. the current default font is very small and i find it hard to read. thanks, thomas. reply wpbeginner support says: apr 6, 2017 at 2:35 am hi thomas, you can go to appearance » customize and click on the additional css tab. then in the css box on the left panel, add this css at the end of whatever text/code you see there. body { 
font-size:16px; 
}
