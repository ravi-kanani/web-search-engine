patrick hutchison • march 26, 2020 how to clean your entire house in 30 minutes no one likes a dirty house. when your living space is cluttered, it makes it harder to focus and get things done. plus, studies have shown that a messy home can lead to higher levels of stress. but there’s a problem: cleaning your abode is rather dull and can seem to require an overwhelmingly long time commitment. while there are times when you do want to dedicate the better part of the day to cleaning every nook and cranny of your house, and occasionally do a thorough decluttering as well, getting your house in reasonably good shape on the regular, or when you have guests coming over, is something you can accomplish in surprisingly short order. cleaning often takes up a lot of time because people don’t create a plan of attack. they wander from room to room, cleaning a little bit here and there, getting distracted, forgetting tools, retracing their steps, and mostly just wasting time. with a bit of organization, you can clean your house much, much faster. sure, if you’ve got a huge home, it’s going to take a bit more time, but for the average house or apartment, you should be able to complete a basic clean in just thirty minutes. here’s how. like this illustrated guide? then you’re going to love our book the illustrated art of manliness! pick up a copy on amazon. illustrated by ted slampyak
