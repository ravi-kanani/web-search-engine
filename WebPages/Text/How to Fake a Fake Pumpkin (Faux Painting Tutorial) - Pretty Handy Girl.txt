(keep your sea sponge dry, not wet during the process.) dip the stencil brush into the white paint and add paint on the outer most bumps on the pumpkins. this is adding highlights. dab the highlights gently with the sea sponge to blend. use the fan brush dipped in a small amount of green paint inside the pumpkin ridges. dab the ridges with the sea sponge to blend. have you ever seen a truly unblemished pumpkin? i think not. it‚Äôs time to add some spots or marks on the pumpkin to truly fool your friends. dip the end of the paint brush into brown paint and dot it onto the pumpkin. blot the spot with a sea sponge and maybe even transfer a few new spots with the sponge. paint grey around the base of the stem and into the grooves with the round paint brush. paint brown and green paint onto the pumpkin stem. blend slightly with the sea sponge. can you spot my fake white pumpkin? well, of course you can because i just showed you how to paint it. but, it will definitely fool your friends! painting realistic blue pumpkins: painting blue pumpkins uses the same technique as painting the white pumpkins, only using a few different colors. use the stencil brush to paint blue onto another pumpkin. dab the blue paint while it‚Äôs still wet with the sea sponge. use the fan brush dipped in gray and brown craft paint to fill in the ridges. dab the paint with the dry sea sponge to blend. add some highlights with a mixture of grey and white. this serves two purposes. 1) it adds dimension. 2) it tones down the excess blue on the pumpkin. paint the stem the same way you learned above. to truly fool people, set up your fake pumpkins with some real pumpkins and real gourds. sooo, can you spot the fakes? how many did you get right? the metallic gourd is simply spray-painted with copper spray paint. but, i did try my hand at faking a green and yellow gourd using the same technique as the pumpkins, but adding green to the top and yellow to the bottom. okay, i‚Äôll give you a second shot. guess the fakes: how did you do this time? ha, you can now apply for a job as an art forgery detective ;-). now seriously, how many people will be viewing your pumpkins that close? umm, next to no one. normally they‚Äôll view them from afar. get your paints and palette out and go fake some fakes! it will be our little secret. did you like this painting post? ahhh, then i know you‚Äôll like this ballard pear painting tutorial: or if you‚Äôre feeling like taking on a larger scale project‚Ä¶how about faux painted bricks! or perhaps you‚Äôd like to perform some faux zinc painting magic: you can do it! i know you can. 3.4kshares facebook twitter pinterest you might also like: accessories, art, arts and craft, autumn fall decor, ballard design pears, crafts, decor, decorating, faux painting brick, home decor, paintbrushes, painting, painting & antiquing techniques, pumpkin, renew, tutorial, upcycling, vignettes comments eli akins says october 7, 2013 at 12:18 pm those pumpkins are incredible! i‚Äôm not one to do the artsy thing, but i know people who are and will pass this on. thanks. reply jessica @ mom 4 real says october 7, 2013 at 6:09 pm awesomeness! i have a faker sitting in my garage right now, and a ton of paint‚Ä¶whoop! reply amy marshall says october 7, 2013 at 6:22 pm thank you so much for sharing this tutorial! pumpkins are sooo expensive, especially if you need to buy a whole bunch. i love the ‚Äúfunny colored‚Äù ones too and they always seem to be more expensive. going to catch some faux pumpkins on sale and/or clearance for next year. üôÇ have a great week! amy http://www.homesweetthriftyhome.com reply corinna ashley says october 7, 2013 at 9:41 pm if it helps anyone on a super tight budget like i am, i shared a similar tutorial last month with cheaper supplies. i know a a lot of you hard core diyers probably have loads of annie sloan chalk paint hanging around, but i dont, and if it helps, i‚Äôve shared the supplies i used too üôÇ http://corinnaashley.com/how-to-paint-artificial-pumpkins-tutorial-tuesday/ reply terri says october 7, 2013 at 10:42 pm thanks, corinna. i don‚Äôt have any annie sloan leftovers, either! reply corinna ashley says october 9, 2013 at 1:18 pm glad it helps terri! brittany bailey says october 8, 2013 at 12:33 pm corinna, that is a great point! thanks for sharing your frugal supplies! love your pumpkins btw. reply corinna ashley says october 9, 2013 at 1:16 pm thanks brittany, thats why i love blogging. so many ways to diy, and its so much fun sharing!
