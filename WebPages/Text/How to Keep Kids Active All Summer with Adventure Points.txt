(tip: use things you plan on doing anyway! this is just a fun way for the kids to earn them). i‚Äôve also found that the kids are excited to be helpful around the house when i offer ‚Äúbonus points‚Äù for doing thing above and beyond their normal responsibilities. after a few days of using the system, i decided to create two separate lists for older kids (5+) and younger ones (4 and under) to match their skill levels since the younger kids were being left behind by older kids (who could do many more pull-ups!). how to implement adventure points if you‚Äôd like to try this system (and i‚Äôd highly recommend it!), here are a few tips for getting started: 1. decide on activities that work in your home/yard make a list of activities you‚Äôd like your kids to do and break it down by age group if needed. figure out how much each activity is worth in the point system you‚Äôd like to use and assign a point value to each. feel free to use my list as a start! 2. decide on rewards chances are that while points are a great motivator, your kids won‚Äôt be thrilled with just earning points that don‚Äôt mean anything. decide on what the points will allow the kids to do or earn and create a list of this for the kids. we try to focus on activities and experiences rather than stuff so our rewards were activities, but physical rewards can be great too especially if they will help kids be active or build a life skill. some ideas of material rewards that encourage learning: puzzles legos dolls board games books slack line or sports equipment 3. track the points i realized that the system wouldn‚Äôt encourage the independent creative time i was hoping for if the kids had to check in with me every time they did an activity to get the points. i decided to use the honor system (which has worked really well so far) and get each kid a small spiral notebook to track points. this way, the kids track their points each day and i just tally once a day to keep the running totals. i also created a chart to help track the points for each activity. you can download a copy for yourself here. 4. enjoy watching your kids learn and play! i was really hoping that creating ‚Äúadventure points‚Äù would free up some of my time by stopping the refrains of ‚Äúi‚Äôm bored‚Äù and ‚Äúcan we watch a movie.‚Äù it certainly has and i‚Äôm definitely grateful for that. i‚Äôve found that even more than the free time, i‚Äôve enjoyed watching my kids creativity soar and the older kids play with the younger ones more easily since they have more structure and ideas for activities (and because there is a goal in mind). also, keeping track of points has been a fun and unexpected math boost for the little kids as i keep hearing questions like ‚Äúdoes 243 plus 15 equal 258?!‚Äù üôÇ your turn! what are some fun ways you encourage creativity and activity during free time at home?

(or chewing nails or whatever other bad habit you want broken) you could even graduate on to a different bad habit. or you could offer points for positive behaviors that you want to work on. for example, we used positive points for doing kind things for one of the siblings. they also liked to ‚Äútattle‚Äù on each others‚Äô good deeds, which means that they were taking time to notice good behaviors from their sibling instead of focusing on the negative. hope my answers help some people. i don‚Äôt know if they answer for the author, just how i implemented a similar token economy in my household. reply lori june 6, 2016 at 6:06 pm what history podcast do you have the kids listen to? reply wellness mama june 6, 2016 at 8:33 pm this one: https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/ reply anna june 6, 2016 at 10:45 am this pretty much just changed our whole summer. my girls ages 7 and 5 are pumped! thanks for the idea. reply lisa june 5, 2016 at 8:42 pm are the kids adding all of their points together to earn the prizes? or are they doing it individually? we‚Äôre looking forward to implementing this soon. some other additions we had from our brainstorm: make a card for a widow make the family a snack playing with bubble machine dance party to music helping grandma clean house checking cows water organizing a cupboard or drawer cleaning the bus or the car here‚Äôs to a great, active summer! thanks so much for sharing your idea. reply robert june 5, 2016 at 11:45 am this is commonly called a ‚Äútoken economy‚Äù ‚Äî https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/token_economy ‚Äî but i don‚Äôt get this one: points awarded for such disparate things as chores and tree climbing? some of them are things you‚Äôd want to incentivize because they might be unattractive on their own, but others are things kids would want to do anyway just because they‚Äôre kids. what sense does it make to put both types of activities on the scale? reply katie - wellness mama september 25, 2017 at 2:25 pm this is what has worked for us. feel free to adapt to your own family‚Äôs needs‚Ä¶ reply tina june 5, 2016 at 10:43 am how well would this work for unwanted behaviors ‚Äì like whining? i‚Äôm thinking 25 bonus points for not whining during the day when asked to do something (like pick up the outside toys before dinner). these points would be assigned by me only ‚Äì i have a almost 9 year old that is about to lose a certain privilege if it continues (he‚Äôs adhd and tends to whine more when tired or hungry ‚Äì but if he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs either he won‚Äôt eat or sleep). reply jane mcleod june 5, 2016 at 6:09 am wow what a great idea! we are going travelling in a caravan with 3 kids for 5 months. this will be perfect! thank you reply sara june 1, 2016 at 8:25 pm maybe i missed something (as i often skim what i read), but are the total amount of points to earn rewards per child or per family? does only one child earn a zoo trip or do all the kids earn a trip? what if one wants a zoo trip and one wants a movie trip with the points or does a certain number qualify for a certain trip automatically? i am sorry i didnt understand the exchange system üôÅ reply jasmine june 1, 2016 at 10:51 am wow!!! what an awesome idea!! you, as always, rock!! reply cindy may 31, 2016 at 11:53 pm wow! what an excellent, positive plan! for creative learning experiences, i can suggest a few. backyard (could be an apartment or even a single room) adventure and mini treasure hunt. first, you need to search through the play areas and list the tiny things that usually go unnoticed, such as tiny insects and animals such as ants and worms (flower pots and planters really do have life), a leaf that is changing its color, a flower of a particular color, an embroidered flower or even a door stop. any small item will do. rather than picking things up and ‚Äúcollecting them,‚Äù (depending on age/s), either pre-make or provide the materials and demonstrate how to make a small picture frame. wooden, used matchsticks work well for indoor and outdoor hunts, craft pop sickle sticks are better for outdoors. explain how to take a pretend picture in the picture frame. and, yes, this is an honor game. using wellness mama‚Äôs point system, assign points to each item on your list. another activity for children with more patience, use the matchstick frame and sit or lay on the lawn and just look for a minute or two, into the picture frame, placed on one spot. life is amazing! you can make a list of things to touch, to smell, to hear (and for tasting, read on‚Ä¶.) a family activity that teaches choices and consequences ‚Äì create an artfully arranged platter of tiny morsels (1/2 inch cubes or smaller) of tasting foods such as veggies, fruits, tofu ‚Äì including some with pungent aromas or flavores such as lemon, lime, garlic, etc.) with a little space between each. a green pea would be one morsel. there can be several of the same item or varieties that have different flavores. sit in a circle with the platter in the middle. ask them to name the items and help. talk about each item tell what it tastes like to you and what happens after you taste it and what it does for your body. then encourage exploration by having the participants ‚Äì one at a time ‚Äì choose and eat or merely taste their selection. encourage comments. this is a great game for introducing new foods.. if your (age 2+) child is convalescing, you might want to do a guided exploration concentrating on one sense at a time, for a minute or more, and have him/her describe each thing noticed while concentrating on that sense. this is fun for grow ups, too. reply newer comments ¬ª show more comments join the conversation... cancel reply your email address will not be published. please read the comment policy. recipe rating your comment your real name * your email address * don't subscribeallreplies to my comments notify me of followup comments via e-mail. you can also subscribe without commenting. you must enable javascript to be able to comment to leave a comment please enable javascript in your browser settings! footer sitemap start here comment policy affiliate disclosure newsletter privacy policy terms of service full disclaimer promo guidelines contact site footer the information on this website has not been evaluated by the fda and is not intended to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease. by accessing or using this website, you agree to abide by the terms of service, full disclaimer, privacy policy, affiliate disclosure, and comment policy. content may not be reproduced in any form. ads provided by cafemedia family & parenting network. displayed ads do not constitute endorsement or recommendation by wellness mama. copyright ¬© 2006‚Äì2020 wellness mama¬Æ ¬∑ all rights reserved ¬∑ sitemap
