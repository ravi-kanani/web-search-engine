dalgona coffee is a whipped frothy coffee thatâ€™s made from instant coffee and sugar, then put on milk. itâ€™s called dalgona because the fluffy creamy coffee looks like dalgona candy, a candy from south korea thatâ€™s just like honeycomb toffee or sponge toffee. youâ€™ve probably eaten honeycomb toffee before, covered in chocolate. i havenâ€™t had it in years but itâ€™s good. where did dalgona coffee come from? the popularity of dalgona coffee mostly stems from south korea where it started trending because of social distancing/isolation. everyone was stuck at home and instagramming their daily lives and dalgona coffee caught on, probably because you donâ€™t need much to make it and itâ€™s really cute. whipped coffee exists elsewhere in the world too â€“ apparently it came to the korea consciousness via a big korean actor discovering it in macau, but they also have it in india and pakistan. do i have to use instant coffee? yes, it has to be instant coffee. thereâ€™s something about instant coffee crystals that creates the right frothy texture to whip up. you can use decaf too if youâ€™re sensitive to caffeine â€“ iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™ll froth up the same way but i canâ€™t guarantee it because we donâ€™t have any decaf instant coffee at home. do i have to use sugar? short answer, yes. long answer, not really? the sugar really helps the instant coffee whip to a fluffy meringue-like texture that holds its shape for a while. but, iâ€™ve also made it using stevia in the raw and that worked too (i assume other granulated sweeteners will as well), but it wasnâ€™t as fluffy. if youâ€™re really sensitive to sugar, you can reduce it down, just know that your fluff wonâ€™t be as fluffy. do i have to use a hand mixer? you can use your arm muscles and a whisk, like i did. it didnâ€™t take long at all, but maybe i have a lot of experience whipping cream and meringues. if you have a hand mixer, stand mixer, frother, or whisk you can make dalgona coffee. does it have to be iced milk? you can use hot milk or iced, itâ€™s up to you! i went with iced because it makes the milk go farther and i need to stretch out my milk for as long as possible because iâ€™m literally frightened to go to the grocery store. you can also use evaporated milk (which comes in cans, perfect!), either watered down a bit or not. what does it taste like? itâ€™s velvety and creamy and full of sweet coffee flavor. kind of a like a non-icy frappuccino. itâ€™s full of strong coffee flavors and pretty darn sweet. but if youâ€™re not so concerned about getting that picture perfect fluffy cap, you can ease up on the amount of fluffy coffee you put on top of your milk. hope you guys give this a try. i absolutely loved it when i made it with just 1 teaspoon of coffee and 1 teaspoon of sugar. as long as you go with equal parts coffee, sugar, and water, you can make the fluffy coffee of your dreams. in the recipe below i kept it at 2 tablespoons of each and made 2 coffees, but feel free to adjust as needed. stay safe and healthy at home :) dalgona coffee dalgona coffee, fluffy coffee, frothy coffee, whipped coffee - whatever you want to call it, itâ€™s an easy 3 ingredient recipe for picture perfect coffee when you canâ€™t go out to a cute cafe serves 2 prep time 1 min cook time 4 mins total time 5 mins ingredients 2 tbsp instant coffee 2 tbsp sugar 2 tbsp very hot water 2 glasses milk with ice cubes instructions bring small pot of water to a boil. while the waterâ€™s coming to a bowl, make the dalgona coffee fluff: in a large bowl, mix together the instant coffee and sugar. once the water comes to a boil, carefully add 2 tablespoons of the hot water to the coffee sugar mix and whisk or use a hand mixer to whip until light and frothy. fill two glasses with ice and pour in the milk. top the glasses with equal amounts of the fluffy coffee. stir throughly before enjoying! 17 comments dennis says: march 25, 2020 at 5:58 am just because you only mention korea, india and pakistan â€“ i believe this was invented by nescafe in greece in 1957. i know this as frappÃ© coffee and it is very popular in greece. see the wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frapp%c3%a9_coffee reply stephanie says: march 25, 2020 at 1:24 pm thanks for the info! reply heather says: march 25, 2020 at 9:20 am are you in the subtle asian cooking group on fb?
