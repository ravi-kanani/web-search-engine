april 7, 2016 at 4:04 pm jay says: haggle! june 11, 2016 at 1:13 am pcworld says: i am working for them as a technician and customer service manager , yes we can discount the item but not all colleagues but few of them, they normally don’t discount the item but you can have a try if he or she like you he can do something for sure , regarding getting free items with your original purchased i have to say some of products has already offer on them that customer not aware of them which is what we call customer offer for example some tv comes with free sound bar they might tell you they will give that free instead of discount but it is free anyways they just trick you not to ask for discount .if you really want to get discount at store get the care plan with product specially if the price of that products is high like tv , if you take care plan for 3 or 2 years and pay the full price example(tv price £1500 2 years care plan will be around £100 ) then you can ask the question if you get the care plan will you get discount at that point they can offer you up to %10 discount and they will give you discount on product itself . don’t worry if you had to buy care plan to get discount you have 45 days to go back to store and get full refund on care plan so this way you have your discount and you got your money back on care plan ,there are more secret in currys to get good deals so good luck 🙂 june 26, 2016 at 1:03 am miss thrifty says: @pcworld – good plan. thanks very much for your insider insights! june 26, 2016 at 9:40 pm frank says: i currently work for currys as a sales assistant and yes you can discounts if you take out a pay as you go care plan then cancel when you get home! it still strikes as a care plan sale for the sales advisor. also ask for it on a business invoice sale as well and you can get upto £100 off september 28, 2016 at 9:23 pm rosie says: only drawback with that is that colleagues lose the strike if it’s cancelled within 3 months october 13, 2016 at 2:54 am holly says: the links seem to take me to a hair extensions site, is my phone bugged lol?! september 28, 2017 at 12:26 am miss thrifty says: oh my goodness holly, you are right! that discount codes site had been around for years, so i don’t know what happened there. i’ve updated the post. thank you for letting me know. 🙂 september 29, 2017 at 10:49 am leave a reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked *leave a comment *your email address will not be published.your name * your email * your website get the latest posts & deals by email: see a sample daily digest email meet miss thrifty miss thrifty is a woman on a mission. she lives in greater manchester, uk, and never pays full price for anything. spend less, live within your means and get out of debt - without resorting to recycling teabags. read more > featured by categories competitions deals & bargains personal finance thrifty baby thrifty beauty thrifty christmas thrifty fashion thrifty food thrifty holidays thrifty home thrifty homebody thrifty outings thrifty planet thrifty wedding latest posts the mythbuster’s guide to saving money on energy billsseptember 5, 2018 rockstar finance gave me $100 to spread some love at christmas. this is how i spent it.december 30, 2017 how to make a reverse advent calendarnovember 3, 2017 what can you do with an old pound coin?
