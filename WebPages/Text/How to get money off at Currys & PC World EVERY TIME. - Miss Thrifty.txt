lots of users have said it had helped then save more when in stores and it also works great on mobiles and tablets when out and about üôÇ keep up the great work! december 22, 2013 at 8:59 am jen says: the sales staff aren‚Äôt allowed to give any discount at all in currys . i used to work there the only thing we could ever do was give a month free of the insurance whatever happens or at a push 2 months free . but we were never allowed to givw discount not even if you spent 10.000 in store as this guy i served once brought a tv for like 2 grand loads of cables and an expensive soundbar he asked for discount said i wasn‚Äôt aloud so he said ask manager and then manager says no. they always said no. there was no point asking as they always said no . its just wrong currys are a terrible company they make most margin on insurances and nearly make a loss on products alone , suprised there still open december 26, 2013 at 3:57 pm kate says: i went into currys yesterday to buy a laptop (that was already in the sale). all i did was said no to the care plan they offer, and he said if i took it out with a months free trial, i could cancel it within the first month at no charge, have ¬£10 off the laptop, and 10% off any accessories. not a huge saving, but a saving nonetheless. december 28, 2013 at 10:15 am alex says: referring to the company‚Äôs website when in store is a great tip. you can reveal and compare the true prices of things and use this knowledge to create your own techniques against the usually confident and bullish salesmen. sometimes they can be helpful, but often their method is to have you paying for a product before you have time to think and consider options. january 20, 2014 at 7:44 pm gordon mcnevin says: i‚Äôm always bringing the phone out in currys to prove a point and see if they can match the prices on their website. it‚Äôs far better to get your items that day without staying in waiting for a delivery. another trick i‚Äôve used when asking for a price match is the fact they are allowed to give a manager discount at their discretion. i was given this the first time without knowing about it, the time after that i asked üôÇ september 20, 2014 at 7:59 am jay says: it‚Äôs true. they have up to 10% to haggle a deal. nice punky lad in my local store just automatically gives 10% off on items to people he likes. december 25, 2015 at 11:45 pm jay says: i work at currys pc world currently, sales staff have no authorisation to give discount, they can only price match items with the managers consent. most people refer to years ago when comet was a competitor and discounts ranged between 5% ‚Äì 10% depending on the purchase price so they could get the sale. if there is any member of staff can give discount they must be a manager, and the official use is for customer service related issues such as goodwill. april 6, 2016 at 4:53 pm miss thrifty says: @jay that‚Äôs very interesting ‚Äì thanks for taking the time to comment. so, maybe worth finding the cheapest price online & screengrabbing via smartphone before visiting a store? april 7, 2016 at 4:04 pm jay says: haggle! june 11, 2016 at 1:13 am pcworld says: i am working for them as a technician and customer service manager , yes we can discount the item but not all colleagues but few of them, they normally don‚Äôt discount the item but you can have a try if he or she like you he can do something for sure , regarding getting free items with your original purchased i have to say some of products has already offer on them that customer not aware of them which is what we call customer offer for example some tv comes with free sound bar they might tell you they will give that free instead of discount but it is free anyways they just trick you not to ask for discount .if you really want to get discount at store get the care plan with product specially if the price of that products is high like tv , if you take care plan for 3 or 2 years and pay the full price example(tv price ¬£1500 2 years care plan will be around ¬£100 ) then you can ask the question if you get the care plan will you get discount at that point they can offer you up to %10 discount and they will give you discount on product itself . don‚Äôt worry if you had to buy care plan to get discount you have 45 days to go back to store and get full refund on care plan so this way you have your discount and you got your money back on care plan ,there are more secret in currys to get good deals so good luck üôÇ june 26, 2016 at 1:03 am miss thrifty says: @pcworld ‚Äì good plan. thanks very much for your insider insights! june 26, 2016 at 9:40 pm frank says: i currently work for currys as a sales assistant and yes you can discounts if you take out a pay as you go care plan then cancel when you get home! it still strikes as a care plan sale for the sales advisor. also ask for it on a business invoice sale as well and you can get upto ¬£100 off september 28, 2016 at 9:23 pm rosie says: only drawback with that is that colleagues lose the strike if it‚Äôs cancelled within 3 months october 13, 2016 at 2:54 am holly says: the links seem to take me to a hair extensions site, is my phone bugged lol?! september 28, 2017 at 12:26 am miss thrifty says: oh my goodness holly, you are right! that discount codes site had been around for years, so i don‚Äôt know what happened there. i‚Äôve updated the post. thank you for letting me know. üôÇ september 29, 2017 at 10:49 am leave a reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked *leave a comment *your email address will not be published.your name * your email * your website get the latest posts & deals by email: see a sample daily digest email meet miss thrifty miss thrifty is a woman on a mission. she lives in greater manchester, uk, and never pays full price for anything. spend less, live within your means and get out of debt - without resorting to recycling teabags. read more > featured by categories competitions deals & bargains personal finance thrifty baby thrifty beauty thrifty christmas thrifty fashion thrifty food thrifty holidays thrifty home thrifty homebody thrifty outings thrifty planet thrifty wedding latest posts the mythbuster‚Äôs guide to saving money on energy billsseptember 5, 2018 rockstar finance gave me $100 to spread some love at christmas. this is how i spent it.december 30, 2017 how to make a reverse advent calendarnovember 3, 2017 what can you do with an old pound coin?
