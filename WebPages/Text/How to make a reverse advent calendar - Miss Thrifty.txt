(you can find more posts about our reverse advent calendars here.) so: instead of spending money on tat novelty items for yourself, why not spend a fraction of the amount on making christmas that little bit nicer for people who are struggling right now? it’s so quick and easy to make a reverse advent calendar. i’ve seen people on pinterest going all tony hart on the idea, and creating beautifully-crafted boxes, but you really don’t have to do that if you don’t have time. an empty, plain cardboard box works just as well. the donations will be split up and food bank users tend to transport their items in carrier bags. what is in the box is what matters most. when is the best time to start? this is an excellent question – and one for which i have a slightly pointed answer. the answer is: not december! many food banks only open for a couple of days a week, and christmas eve falls on a sunday this year. if you begin filling your reverse advent calendar on 1 december, with the aim of dropping off your donations after 24 december, the supplies won’t get to people until january is under way. then again, december is fine – as long as you are aware that your supplies won’t get to people until the following month. that isn’t necessarily a bad thing: apparently donations to food banks peak in december and drop off in january. your local food bank volunteers won’t mind; they are simply grateful for any supplies you can provide. however if you are making a reverse advent calendar to help tide people over the christmas period, the best time to start is the end of october or early november. that way, you can get your box to your local food bank a few weeks before the christmas break, which leaves plenty of time for its contents to be sorted and distributed. what should i put in my reverse advent calendar? at the trussell trust, more than 90% of the food is donated by the general public. it is collected and divided into food parcels, each of which will provide at least three days of healthy, balanced meals for individuals and families. a typical food parcel will include the following: breakfast cereal. packet or tinned soup. pasta. rice. pasta sauce. baked beans. tinned meat. tinned vegetables. tea or coffee. tinned fruit. biscuits. non-food items, such as toiletries and feminine hygiene products, are also appreciated. what did you put in your advent calendar? day 1: a six-pack of toilet roll (£2). day 2: tin of baked beans (25p). day 3: a pack of 20 nappies (£1.38) and a pack of baby wipes (56p). nappies are expensive, but the supermarket value packs come in at around the £1.40-£1.70 mark and are perfectly serviceable. i didn’t buy the value baby wipes, although they cost 10p less, because the chemicals irritated my babies’ bottoms when they were little. own-brand sensitive wipes it was. day 4: tin of irish stew (60p). day 5: another tin of baked beans (32p), supermarket brand this time. day 6: tin of sliced carrots (20p). day 7: tin of potatoes (35p). day 8: spray bottle of kitchen cleaner (£1). day 9: bottle of shampoo (40p). day 10: bag of rice (65p). day 11: bag of penne pasta (40p). day 12: tin of chicken curry (60p). day 13: tin of tomatoes (25p). day 14: tin of spaghetti in tomato sauce (20p). day 15: tin of peas (40p). day 16: three bars of soap (50p). day 17: small bag of sugar (50p). day 18: bottle of washing-up liquid (61p). i went for supermarket own-brand: the value stuff just doesn’t last long. day 19: jar of lemon curd (35p). day 20: tin of custard (30p) and a packet of strawberry jelly cubes (55p). day 21: tin of sardines (50p). day 22: a packet of sanitary towels (25p), a box of tampons (71p) and a packet of incontinence pads (£1.25). day 23: biscuit assortment (£1), containing four packets of different biscuits. day 24: bag of banana eclairs (70p). everybody deserves a sweet treat at christmas, right? what items are not suitable for a reverse advent calendar? the following items should be avoided: perishable food. food past its use-by or best-before date. chocolate advent calendars. (there is a sad reason for this, which i have detailed at the bottom of this post.) how much does a reverse advent calendar cost? my reverse advent calendar cost £16.78. as you can see from the list of items, the prices varied. the most expensive item i added was a multipack of toilet roll, which cost £2. however the cheapest items, tinned carrots and tinned spaghetti, cost just 20p each. if your own budget is tight and you don’t have £17 to spare, but you still want to make a reverse advent calendar for your local food bank, you could do so for less than £5 (20p tins x 24 days = £4.80). how do i find my nearest food bank? if you are in the uk, you can find your nearest trussell trust food bank by using this postcode tool. the website will have also have contact details, so you can arrange to drop your box off. not all food banks are run by the trussell trust. your local supermarket is likely to have a poster on its noticeboard, with details of the closest one. if you are in the usa, there is a similar tool on the feeding america website. both the trussell trust and feeding america recommend that, if you are planning to donate grocery products, you contact your nearest food bank to find out what they are short of at that time. the trussell trust also lists these items on the local food bank pages so, even if you know where your nearest food bank is, it’s worth a look. i enjoyed putting my reverse advent calendar together: i’m delighted that such a small amount of time, effort and expenditure can make such a difference to somebody’s christmas. a final note: avoid adding this item to your reverse advent calendar. this is gloomy but, if you are planning to make a reverse advent calendar, you should know this. when my fellow money blogger faith, from much more with less, spoke to a volunteer at her local food bank, she discovered that chocolate advent calendars are not recommended items. apparently, chocolate advent calendars often arrive too late and create unrealistic hopes and expectations about christmas day: “for most children getting food bank parcels, there is no pot of gold at the end of the calendar.” did you enjoy this post?
