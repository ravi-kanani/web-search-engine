(i don’t think the first will do the bathroom enamel any good. as for the second: alka-seltzer works out to be a relatively expensive cleaning method!) so here is my toilet cleaner of choice. you will need: white vinegar bicarbonate of soda an empty bottle if you don’t have an empty bog cleaner bottle, an empty spray bottle will do. also useful: – a knife or something sharp, for popping the lid off the empty bottle. – a funnel, for getting the ingredients in there without making a mess. to make your own toilet cleaner, add the two ingredients to the bottle in the following quantities: 1 cup of vinegar 1/4 cup of bicarbonate of soda squirt, then let it sit for a while – just as you would with the gloopy toilet cleaner from the supermarket – and scrub. done! image credit: alexbrn. did you enjoy this post? share the love miss thrifty on: free daily digest get the latest posts and deals by emails: 12 responses to “how to make your own toilet cleaner” popbabe7 says: i have tried the cheap coke method when i moved in my flat. it did get rid of the yucky black stuff in the bog, without damaging it. october 21, 2011 at 5:03 pm [email protected] says: i’ve been using cheap bleach to clean my toilet for years. i like your method better because it’s easier on the environment. thanks!!! october 28, 2011 at 6:15 pm nick says: slighty off the particuar topic iem but household nonetheless; if you have a scourer or spongy-thing for washing the dishes, then you know that after a while they can start to smell and go a bit manky! all you need to do to return them to pristine condition is to pop in the microwave for 30 seconds. dampen first and of course non metal scourers only lol. october 30, 2011 at 1:34 pm cath says: mine exploded….. february 10, 2012 at 4:27 pm lili says: this tip looks great and going to try it. i spend alot on toilet cleaners and need to economise so am checking out all your tips. wish had found this site earlier. i love it. i think i could get quite hooked. march 12, 2012 at 2:11 pm andrew @ toronto plumbing says: pretty fantastic idea, i remember making volcanos out of this stuff back in the day.. haha august 21, 2012 at 4:04 am cyd says: that’s gonna blow up all over the place. are you kidding? february 1, 2013 at 10:05 pm miss thrifty says: erm, i’ve been using it for years and it hasn’t blown up yet. february 6, 2013 at 4:10 pm thrifty lesley says: sounds great. do you have to mix and then use, or can you mix up more to keep in the bottle ready for next time? wondering if after all the fizzing it loses its efficacy august 10, 2016 at 6:24 pm hazel says: did as you said and the whole lot shot out at 100mph, i had put the lid on and the bottle was about to pop! i didn’t even shake it. are you sure you are using bicarbonate of soda? august 6, 2017 at 4:35 pm leave a reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked *leave a comment *your email address will not be published.your name * your email * your website get the latest posts & deals by email: see a sample daily digest email meet miss thrifty miss thrifty is a woman on a mission. she lives in greater manchester, uk, and never pays full price for anything. spend less, live within your means and get out of debt - without resorting to recycling teabags. read more > featured by categories competitions deals & bargains personal finance thrifty baby thrifty beauty thrifty christmas thrifty fashion thrifty food thrifty holidays thrifty home thrifty homebody thrifty outings thrifty planet thrifty wedding latest posts the mythbuster’s guide to saving money on energy billsseptember 5, 2018 rockstar finance gave me $100 to spread some love at christmas. this is how i spent it.december 30, 2017 how to make a reverse advent calendarnovember 3, 2017 what can you do with an old pound coin? here are 5 great ideas.october 22, 2017 decorating a 1950s bedroom on a budgetoctober 21, 2017 popular posts become an expert haggler in four easy stepsjanuary 16, 2014 eight simple ways to reduce food wastejanuary 10, 2014 how to get money off at currys & pc world every time.december 17, 2013 how to get money off at debenhams every time.november 7, 2013 how to make a fruit fly trapseptember 8, 2013 how to make your own toilet cleaneroctober 20, 2011 six thrifty uses for a lemonaugust 28, 2009 make do and mend: vogue for the credit crunch bunchseptember 30, 2008 lifestyle blog of the year the cosmo cupcake of win: miss thrifty won cosmpolitan's lifestyle blog of the year award in 2011. nom nom. read more > popular posts become an expert haggler in four easy steps eight simple ways to reduce food waste how to get money off at currys & pc world every time. join the thrifties get the latest posts & deals by email: © miss thrifty - all rights reserved the floating frog handmade in the uk google
