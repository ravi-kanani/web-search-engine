and style curly hair may 31, 2016 by hair romance 68 comments i finally made a tutorial on how to style curly hair and it‚Äôs a video as well! this has been one of my most requested tutorials and it‚Äôs finally here. i wash my hair maybe once or twice a week, depending on what i‚Äôm shooting for the blog or where i‚Äôm going. it all depends on the hairstyles i want to wear. i have been known to sometimes push it longer than a week and that‚Äôs where braids come in. for this curly hair tutorial i have also used a diffuser to speed up the process because my hair can take a really long time to dry naturally. if i‚Äôve got a day where i‚Äôm just working on my laptop, i wash my hair in the morning and leave it to dry all day. it will often take most of the day to dry which isn‚Äôt that convenient. i do get a better result with less frizz when i just let my hair air dry but i do like using a diffuser because it gives me a little bit more volume at the roots. as always if you‚Äôre trying to grow your hair the less heat the better, so only blow dry your hair when you really have to. i‚Äôm sorry i am not going to bring you into the shower with me but i have replicated what i can in front of the camera for you so you can see how i wash and style my curly hair. check out the video below. how to wash and style curly hair part 1 ‚Äì in the shower so, obviously this isn‚Äôt in the video but i do use a light shampoo on my hair. often a sulfate-free shampoo though sometimes a sulfate shampoo because i‚Äôm testing so many products for the blog. if you have naturally curly hair, a sulfate-free shampoo or just a conditioner wash will be all that you need. i use a wide tooth comb to detangle my hair in the shower and i usually always do a hair treatment. i rinse that out and while i‚Äôm still in the shower while the water is running, i part my hair. i create a side part, though not too straight. a little zig-zag part is more flattering in curly hair. i then give my hair a final rinse and make sure it‚Äôs completely saturated. oh, i forgot to add before i hop in the shower i make sure that my curly hair styling products are right next to the shower so i can put them in while i‚Äôm still in the shower. after the shower but with really wet hair so as i turn the shower off, i immediately grab my curl cream, mix it between my palms and apply it through my hair. i apply curl cream right through my hair and running my fingers through to help the curls form and clump together. i then give my hair a light scrunch just to release some of the water and help the curl cream really mix into my hair. my hair is dripping wet at this point. i tip my hair to the side so that i can let the curls hang freely and give them a good scrunch right up to the root and squeeze out some excess water. at this point, i‚Äôll also use an old t-shirt just to give a really light scrunch and squeeze to my curls to remove the excess water. my curls still quite wet at this point. next, i grab my gel. i mix the gel between my palms and using open hands, smooth the gel over my hair. i‚Äôm not running my fingers through my hair so much as smoothing the gel over the curls. i then apply more gel to the ends of my hair and scrunch up. i grab my t-shirt again and use this to scrunch the curls up to my head. give them a little twisting scrunch so that you‚Äôre removing as much water as possible. extra styling tip to add volume, i‚Äôm going to use some flat pin clips at the roots of my hair. these help to hold up my hair at the roots so it doesn‚Äôt dry flat. it‚Äôs at this point where i would normally leave my hair to air dry but let‚Äôs speed it up with a diffuser. blowdrying your curls then i take my blow dryer always with the diffuser attached. i set my dryer to high heat but low speed. you want to really get the heat into your hair but you don‚Äôt want to be blowing it around as this will just cause more frizz. i let my hair fall into the diffuser and bring the diffuser right up into my hair and work very slowly, one section at a time. i blow dry my hair to about 80% dry so that i don‚Äôt create that extra frizz at the end. scrunch out the crunch the final step is to scrunch out the gel and you have to wait until you‚Äôre hair is 100% dry for this step. if you try and do it before you will just create more frizz. your hair may feel a little bit crispy from the gel and there are two ways to break that crispy cast and release the defined curls underneath. the first way is to use an old t-shirt and do the same scrunching motion. this breaks the physical cast of the gel around your hair and leaves you with you soft curls. alternatively, pick up your diffuser again and just using it on a medium heat, warm your hair slightly and then scrunch again. you‚Äôll break the gel cast with mix of heat and scrunching. tame flyaways if my hair has a few flyaways, i use a drop or two of oil to smooth over and define the ends. i also like to give my hair a bit of a shake just to get a bit more volume at the roots. there‚Äôs a trick to it ‚Äì put your finger tips right through the roots of your hair and then give a little lift like a tiny shake and then bring your hands straight back out the way it came in. you don‚Äôt want to run your fingers through your curls you just want to put them into your hair lift at the roots and then bring your hand straight back out. if you notice any curls are sitting a little funny you can dampen them down with water and then re-twist them to get a better shaped curl. products i used hairdryer yarok curl cream from nourished life or follain. taft hair gel darshana hair oil now that looks like a lot of steps that‚Äôs written down but the whole process doesn‚Äôt take me too long and does leave me with great curls for days. i would love to what curly hair products you love and what‚Äôs your curly hair routine? ps. have you got my new curly hair ebook? you may also like... no related posts. filed

elizabeth says may 31, 2016 at 3:30 pm yay ‚Äì you did it! thanks to all you curly hair inspiration i‚Äôve been wearing mine much more often since being back in sydney (london water stole my bounce). can seriously relate to how long it takes to air dry though. i‚Äôve been known to turn up to work with ‚Äúplastic hair‚Äù which is still drying. another trick i learnt for breaking the cast is to gather sections and gently twist them. this seems to work and is a little quicker than yet more scrunching. thanks for giving my curls another chance. üòÄ reply emily says may 31, 2016 at 10:44 pm thank you for creating this tutorial. i‚Äôve fought my curls with a flatiron for ages; your blog has helped me finally embrace them. thank you so much for taking the time to describe each step of your process. i can‚Äôt wait to finally master this and then start working on braids and twists. üôÇ reply hair romance says june 1, 2016 at 2:33 am thanks so much, emily! i really hope this helps and let me know if you have any questions xx reply jaclyn lorimer says june 2, 2016 at 11:57 pm my routine is very similar except that i give it a shot of curl spray after scrunching in the cream and gel, after giving it 20 minutes or so to dry a little. then i break the cast as you say, once it‚Äôs totally dry. my hair is more of a medium thickness and i find that a curl spray gives it a bit more body and shine. oh, another thing i always do to help it keep its style is ‚Äúsleep like ariel‚Äù in that i put all my hair up above my head while i sleep so that i don‚Äôt smush my curls down and flatten them. http://mrwgifs.com/ariel-ready-to-go-to-sleep-in-the-little-mermaid/ thanks for always having such consistent, practical help on this blog! xo, jaclyn reply hair romance says june 4, 2016 at 2:10 pm thanks so much, jaclyn! which curl spray do you use? love that tip for sleeping like ariel! xx reply lissa says june 3, 2016 at 1:47 am since you go several days without washing., how do you sleep on it so it doesn‚Äôt look smooshed? any advise for helping my extremely curly toddlers hair as i have very straight hair reply hair romance says june 4, 2016 at 2:10 pm hi lissa, i clip my hair up at night like this ‚Äì https://www.hairromance.com/2013/11/the-secret-to-waking-up-with-great-curly-hair.html. not sure how long your daughter‚Äôs hair is but you can do smaller clips or a top knot xx reply kimberly purcell says june 5, 2016 at 1:38 pm i learned this from you! i have curly hair and would usually get rid of the frizz by using a curling iron. ironic, right? i like that your diffuser has holes in the ‚Äòfingers‚Äô. reply hair romance says june 5, 2016 at 7:02 pm haha i have done the same in the past (and still do it sometimes!) this diffuser has a great design and works really well xx reply alexis says june 5, 2016 at 7:41 pm this works for me, although i can‚Äôt guarantee everyone will have success with it. i wash my hair a couple of times a week; any less often and i can‚Äôt stand it. (people always say 2-3 day hair is easier to style but mine has the most traction right after i wash it.) in the shower, i shampoo my hair before doing anything else. i use redken all soft shampoo. after rinsing i work in redken all soft heavy cream condition and all soft conditioner. i wind the whole thing up on my head and clamp it in place with a big claw clip, and finish my shower. the last thing i do is rinse my hair, so the conditioners are probably in there for about 15 minutes. i comb the conditioner through while i rinse under a blast of big water pressure from the shower head. then i wrap my hair in a microfiber towel‚Äìthis had made a big difference in how it turns out. after another 15-20 minutes, i shake out my hair, spray in it‚Äôs a 10 miracle leave-in plus keratin, and add a pea-sized amount of pureology super smooth smoothing cream. when it‚Äôs about 60% dry (the microfiber towel helps this happen pretty fast, even though my hair is thick and about 20 inches long) i point the hair dryer at the roots on the top and crown of my head for lift. then i stand in front of a big electric fan and let it blow my hair around till it‚Äôs mostly dry. the last thing i add is one drop of all soft argan-6 multi-care oil. i don‚Äôt work for redken but i did happen to find that this line works really well for me. pureology worked better but it made me itch and break out. reply hair romance says june 5, 2016 at 8:32 pm thanks for sharing your routine, alexis! i love that all soft heavy cream treatment and used to use it all the time. thanks for the reminder as i had almost forgotten about it üôÇ great tip for the microfiber towel too! xx reply teri says june 7, 2016 at 12:26 am these tips are terrific. thanks so much! reply hair romance says june 7, 2016 at 1:34 am thanks so much, teri! xx reply lisa says june 11, 2016 at 4:55 am hi christina, lisa here, from portugal. i knew this already because i follow your blogs for years now, but wow, i got amazed again today by how similar to mine your curls look and act! especially in video, because i could see how they ‚Äúmove‚Äù and behave ‚Äì just like mine. if i colored my curls blonde, we‚Äôd be hair twins. üôÇ well, at least when you wear your culs out ‚Äì because sadly, for the life of me, i can‚Äôt braid my hair: i‚Äôm a very clumsy braider. i follow the same routine of curl cream, scrunch, gel, scrunch and diffuser. my favorite curl cream for some time now is from the the garnier fructis hydra-curl line (not sure if you have it in australia). congratulations on another great piece for us curly haired girls. reply hair romance says june 16, 2016 at 1:33 pm hi hair twin! thanks so much for following along, lisa, and i love that we have the same hair üôÇ i will have to try the garnier prods, i‚Äôll pick some up next time i‚Äôm at the shops. i‚Äôm hoping to do more curly videos soon ‚Äì maybe some braids? i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to do them in your hair üôÇ christina xx reply sarah hatcher says june 27, 2016 at 1:57 am hi brilliant video! has helped me loads! just a little question! what do you look for in a gel? i‚Äôm in the uk and finding it a bit hard to find a good gel as i‚Äôm trying to follow the curly girl method thanks sarah reply hair romance says june 27, 2016 at 10:23 am thanks sarah! this gel is suitable for the curly girl method and it might be sold under the brand got2b in the uk. eco gel is another popular gel and the boots essential gel is also cg friendly üôÇ reply sarah says june 28, 2016 at 5:27 pm that‚Äôs great thank you, will have a look at the products! also can you recommend a deep conditioner for the cg method? i feel my hair needs more moisture esp with the humid weather we‚Äôre having at the moment in the uk! there‚Äôs so many to choose from! thanks again sarah x reply sarah hatcher says june 28, 2016 at 6:24 pm thanks that‚Äôs great will give them a try! also can you recommend a deep conditioner? there‚Äôs so many out there i don‚Äôt know what one to choose! i feel my hair needs a deep conditioner esp due to the humid weather we‚Äôre having in the u.k. at the moment! thank you again reply hair romance says july 1, 2016 at 1:59 pm thanks sarah! i love original & mineral 7 day miracle ‚Äì it smells heavenly and works so well. it‚Äôs a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. otherwise schwarzkopf have some great masks that are really good value. i‚Äôm not sure if they might be branded as extra care or got2b in the uk? anyway, you just want to look for a moisturising treatment rather than a protein treatment xx reply hair romance says july 1, 2016 at 1:59 pm thanks sarah! i love original & mineral 7 day miracle ‚Äì it smells heavenly and works so well. it‚Äôs a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. otherwise schwarzkopf have some great masks that are really good value. i‚Äôm not sure if they might be branded as extra care or got2b in the uk? anyway, you just want to look for a moisturising treatment rather than a protein treatment xx reply littlefieryone says june 28, 2016 at 10:33 pm thanks, christina, in general for the curly hair tips! your website has been part of the process of me learning how to take care of my curly hair. my hormones changed a few years ago and !voila! i had curly hair. i had wanted curly hair my whole life but had no idea what to do with it. my stylist had me try out the deva curl line of products two years ago, and i love them. they are pricey, but a little goes a long way. on an average wash day, every 3-4 days, i use the low poo and one condition. then i flip my head upside down and scrunch with a microfiber towel to get water out. then i scrunch in the volumizing foam and gently turn my head back upright. if i can, i use the flat clips for volume, but usually i am out the door to work, so i just change the side of my part every hour or so, which helps with volumizing. once it‚Äôs all dry, i scrunch to uncrunch. i don‚Äôt blowdry, because i end up with straw if i do. for day two hair i sometimes cheat and use john freida dream curls to smooth things out. deva curl set and above is helpful for day 3 hair to get it pumped up again, but you have to be ok with the beachy/rock n roll look. i sleep with my hair ariel style as mentioned in a previous comment. i use a microfiber or silk pillowcase. the towel and the pillowcase have made a huge difference in reducing frizz. reply hair romance says july 1, 2016 at 1:57 pm oh this is great! thanks so much for commenting and sharing your routine. i love to hear what products others use and so glad you‚Äôre embracing your curls too üôÇ xx reply jolie says june 30, 2016 at 10:59 pm thank you so much for explaining what you do so clearly! i think this is really going to help me since i have some trouble with finding the right routine for my hair. the only thing i‚Äôm not really sure about is what a curl cream is? does it make your hair a bit hard like gel would do? or is it only to moisturize your hair and make it soft and healthy? i wonder this since i can‚Äôt really find a curling cream because i live in the netherlands and i‚Äôm not sure what kind of product to look for. i‚Äôm also gonna try out your tips with the zigzag parting and de hair clips because my hair only ever want to fall in one parting but this always makes my hair quite flat at the top. xxx jolie reply hair romance says july 1, 2016 at 1:52 pm hi jolie, thanks for commenting and i hope this helps üôÇ yes the curl cream is more moisturising. some people use more conditioner if they have thick or dry hair so you could try that first before buying other products. most brands do have a curl cream in the range and they‚Äôll be moisturising with a little bit of hold as well. good luck! x reply lyn says july 8, 2016 at 10:11 pm what do you do between washings, to keep your hair looking so nice? reply hair romance says july 11, 2016 at 8:40 am hi lyn, i clip it up every night when i sleep and i refresh my curls in the morning with a water spray and maybe a little curl cream or oil if it needs it. i‚Äôve got some more tips here too ‚Äì https://www.hairromance.com/2014/09/reader-question-how-do-i-revive-my-2nd-day-curls-back-to-life.html xx reply kate says july 15, 2016 at 6:25 am i‚Äôm in my forties and my straight hair decided to go curly all of a sudden and i had no idea how to deal with it. these tips are very helpful. thank you for such a definitive and thorough explanation of your hair routine. this sounds exactly like what i need. reply hair romance says july 15, 2016 at 10:16 am thanks so much, kate, i hope this helps with your hair üôÇ it‚Äôs common for hair to change and check out my post on why did my hair change from straight to curly. good luck with your new curls xx reply jean congdon says august 18, 2016 at 6:30 am question on in the shower process. my hair is a bit curlier than yours, but about the same length. here is my dilemma: i don‚Äôt like getting soap on my hair, or hair conditoner/gel on my body. so now i go through all these ‚Äúhoops‚Äù to avoid that. i begin with shampoo and rinse, then add conditioner, clip hair up on my head, wash my body and rinse, then let the clip down, rinse conditioner out, add gel or curl cream, then clip my hair up again, put on a plastic shower cap, then use soap once more to wash the conditioner and gel off my body, i wash my face with cleansing cream, then dry my body off and let my hair down again. ridiculous! is there an easier way for me to shower? my husband gets annoyed by my 30 minute showers, and i‚Äôm embarrassed when we vacation with friends and stay in the same condo. they‚Äôre all waiting for me to get out of the shower! reply hair romance says august 19, 2016 at 8:25 am hi jean, i feel you and washing my hair can be a long process too. my friend also has to do a full body wash after washing her hair as the conditioner causes her to break out on her chest and back. i‚Äôm not sure how to help but maybe you could change the process to first, wash your hair and condition ‚Äì while conditioner is on your hair, wash your face. then rinse out, apply products and put your hair up in the cap. then wash your body as the last step. this saves you washing your body twice. good luck! x reply lilly says december 6, 2016 at 3:02 am i am 69 and have long curly wavy hair. it is easier to wear it curly as i live in humid climate. i sometimes blow ut out straight in less humid weather for a change. my question is most of my hair is mostly same length except on top, should i opt for layers for more volume but i find as i am aging hair is not as thick. i do not know what to do> reply hair romance says december 6, 2016 at 10:10 am hi lilly, you don‚Äôt need layers, especially if you‚Äôre happy with how your hair is now. too many layers will thin out your hair so it‚Äôs ok to keep it all one length. if you wanted a change, a few long layers around the front could work well üôÇ christina xx reply sofie says december 9, 2016 at 2:39 pm this helped my hair so much! i have always had problems with frizz and for the first time in months i feel as though my curls took contained and have more ringlets than i‚Äôve ever had! thanks so much! reply hair romance says december 11, 2016 at 8:59 am oh yay, thanks sofie! you‚Äôll find your curls will keep getting better the more you wear them out. good luck xx reply kristin says february 16, 2017 at 8:00 am hello, you said you use a hair treatment in the show. what do you mean by hair treatment? also, do you do that between shampoo and conditioner? i‚Äôm new to your blog and i am very excited that i found it! thanks! reply hair romance says february 17, 2017 at 6:00 pm hi kristin! yes i do a deep conditioning treatment or hair mask in between shampoo and conditioner. i‚Äôm always testing different masks but lately i like the jessicurl treatments and alchemy too. if you want to work with what you‚Äôve got, you can leave your regular conditioner on for a bit longer to act like a deep treatmemt xx reply kristin says february 23, 2017 at 1:30 am thanks for the tip! reply rebecca says march 2, 2017 at 9:20 pm i have similar curls to you. i am still trying to find the right concoction for my curls to be defined and not frizzy, especially on days 2, 3 etc. i currently do the loc method (leave in conditioner, oil and curl cream), have you tried this method? what is your reasoning for not using a leave-in conditioner? reply hair romance says march 9, 2017 at 11:07 pm hi rebecca, i haven‚Äôt tried this yet but i have been doing some research and am keen to give it a go. to be honest, i do mix up my routine quite a lot as i‚Äôm always trying new products. this video routine is my foolproof fallback that i know always works but from time to time i use a different mix of products. i will report back once i try it! xx reply kathi says march 9, 2017 at 8:11 pm hey, i just found your blog and i must say: it‚Äôs awesome!! i love my curly hair, but i never really know how to style and treat it ideally. so your posts really help a lot! üôÇ i just have one big problem, maybe you can help me with that: my hairs are about shoulder length but they are very thick and heavy. so my hair barely every gets curly at the roots. it has only nice curls at the ends. a few years ago, my whole head used to be curly haha üôÇ do you have any idea what i could do to make it curly at the roots again as well? thanks üôÇ kathi reply hair romance says march 9, 2017 at 10:49 pm thanks so much, kathi! if your hair is thick and heavy, it can cause it to hang down and straighten at the roots. you could try twisting your hair when it is wet and using the clips at the roots (as in the video). maybe a haircut can help bring back more curls as well. i tend to have longer layers but my last haircut had more layers and it has helped the shape of my hair a lot. maybe this might work for you too x reply kathi says march 17, 2017 at 7:13 pm thank you so much for the tip! üôÇ i‚Äôm gonna try some layers next time i‚Äôm going to the hairdresser! xx reply tracey says may 25, 2017 at 8:18 am love this! reply lori l knoell says june 14, 2017 at 1:13 pm the hairbrush microphone was the best, lol. my hair is very similar to yours. my approach already matched yours near exact with exception to the t-shirt where i used a towel. i‚Äôll try the shirt though. to add volume on top, i use a clip to pull up the top and then put a dab of hair spray there. reply hair romance says june 15, 2017 at 4:13 pm thanks lori! and great tip for the hairspray. i can never get my hair big enough xx reply shannon says september 6, 2017 at 9:34 pm thank you so much! i love your youtube channel, and since stumbling across your re-vive 2nd day curls video and post, i am loving my curls! for the first time in a long time i am loving them days after the initial wash and dry. i have battled with hating my hair in the past, and whilst i had grown to like it over the last few years, actually loving my natural hair and curls is very freeing! i look forward to seeing more! if you had any styling tips for above the shoulder curly hair that would be awesome üòâ reply hair romance says september 9, 2017 at 6:20 pm thanks so much shannon! i so appreciate you commenting üôÇ xx my hair is a bit longer now but yes will do some posts on styling shorter curls too üôÇ xx reply clare says september 13, 2017 at 12:40 pm hi, i was wondering if you‚Äôd be opposed to me re-blogging this post on my hairstyling website? please let me know, thank you!! reply hair romance says september 15, 2017 at 9:24 am hi clare, thanks for asking and i‚Äôm happy for you to share one image with a link back to my original post but please don‚Äôt share the written content or the post in its entirety. thanks, christina reply clare says september 16, 2017 at 11:02 am thanks christina! yes, that was actually what i meant to say i would do. i was basically just going to do a ‚Äúpress this‚Äù thing. üòâ thank you again. reply hair romance says september 16, 2017 at 8:00 pm great, thanks clare! reply paige b. says january 4, 2018 at 3:41 am love this tutorial, super helpful! i live in the us and can‚Äôt seem to find taft anywhere ‚Äì any suggestions on what i could use instead? reply hair romance says january 7, 2018 at 5:38 pm hi paige, are you in australia? taft is available from priceline or supermarkets. alternatively ecogel or la looks are good value gels in the usa, or in the uk, boots gel is great too xx reply olivia says february 16, 2018 at 3:26 pm hi christina, i‚Äôm so glad i‚Äôve found this fantastic blog! my hair is similar to yours i think but i‚Äôve always found it hit or miss as to how my curls look! is your hair really thick or does it just look this way? mine is only medium thickness. i bought the dry shampoo and xxl spray you recommended today so can‚Äôt wait to try that! i‚Äôm curious where you get those pin clips? also curious about what curling wand you use? i‚Äôve never tried one before. thanks! üôÇ reply hair romance says february 17, 2018 at 8:52 am hi olivia! i bought the pin curl clips from https://www.sahairsupplies.com.au/pindp/santorini-100pk-pin-curl_dash_-double/pd.php and you can find them at beauty supply stores and i think at priceline too. the muk curl stick ‚Äì https://www.sydneysalonsupplies.com.au/curling-irons/muk-curl-stick-3-changeable-barrels.html ‚Äì is great because it has interchangeable barrels so you can match your curls easily. i also use the large barrel when i straighten my hair to create waves. if you just need a small single barrel, silver bullet or remington are good options too xx reply olivia says february 16, 2018 at 3:26 pm i should have added that i‚Äôm in australia too üôÇ reply olivia says february 17, 2018 at 2:49 pm thank you so much for that info and links! i can‚Äôt wait to get some. do you have a tutorial for how you create waves? currently i either: straighten my hair, or wash it and leave it curly (and hope for the best!). i love that ‚Äòblow wave‚Äô look like in your profile photo üôÇ reply theresa romero says march 7, 2018 at 8:32 am wow! thanks so much for making this great tutorial and video! after a lifetime of having straight hair, my hair started turning curly and has been doing so for years now, but i couldn‚Äôt find the right information that would empower me to style my now mostly curly hair. you did a great job on this and i finally feel ready to embrace my curls. thanks soooooo much! t reply hair romance says march 8, 2018 at 12:12 am thanks so much, theresa xx reply tt says march 10, 2018 at 9:40 pm hello and thank you for your wisdom and tips. can you tell me where you get your supply of pin curl clips please? reply hair romance says march 11, 2018 at 3:18 pm thanks! i bought mine from sa hair & beauty in sydney but you can find them on amazon too ‚Äì https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3daps&field-keywords=pin+curl+clips xx reply rhonda says may 17, 2018 at 12:31 pm thank you so much. i got the dashana indian oil and got my curls back. i‚Äôm so thrilled. reply hannah says june 5, 2018 at 12:56 pm hi there! what is the brand of shower comb that you show in your video? i couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere on the blog! thanks üôÇ reply hair romance says june 11, 2018 at 9:13 pm hi hannah, i use the ghd wide comb in the shower. it‚Äôs a carbon fibre so doesn‚Äôt produce static like a plastic comb and i love it x reply faith says june 12, 2018 at 11:47 pm hi christina, i don‚Äôt use gel in my hair, so you think that step would work if i used a heavier oil in my hair instead? p.s. i love this tutorial! i hope it will work on my hair type, trying it tomorrow reply hair romance says june 26, 2018 at 8:35 am thanks faith! yes, you can adapt it to suit your hair. try it just with a little oil and see how it goes üôÇ x reply tori says august 2, 2018 at 5:51 pm hi christina! i recently discovered your blog and i‚Äôm in love. my curls are very similar to yours and i look forward to taming them with your methods! i‚Äôm a graduate student from florida and i‚Äôm on a pretty strict budget, do you have any drugstore recommendations for curl cream and oil?
