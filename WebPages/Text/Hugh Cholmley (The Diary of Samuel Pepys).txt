son of sir hugh cholmley of whitby, yorks. having established his reputation in the construction of whitby pier, he was given charge in 1663 of the building of the mole at tangier. he and his wife (lady anne compton, daughter of the 2nd earl of northampton) lived there at intervals until he was replaced by sheeres as surveyor-general of the project in 1676. pepys had a high regard for him but preferred sheeres's method of constructing the mole. from c. 1662 he was first gentleman-usher to the queen--hence his flow of information about the court--and in parliament in 1679 and 1685 proved to be a loyal but not uncritical opponent of exclusion. his personal papers are impressively tidy and welll-ordered, and his account of his tangier career (published in 1787) very readable. ✹ cgs on 15 dec 2009 • link more: http://thepeerage.com/p22439.htm ✹ bill on 26 jun 2015 • link hugh cholmeley, afterwards the third baronet of that name;

(sir william, jane's brother-in-law, was first mentioned in the diaries as "mr turner the draper".) http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1… https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_turner_%28l… to my knowledge, sam never mentions his kinship with william turner in the diary, but it's a matter of public record that john, jane's husband, was his brother. the connection is easily traceable because both were born at kirkleatham in north yorkshire. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirkleatham ✹ sasha clarkson on 16 dec 2017 • link here is the 'history of parliament online' biography of sir hugh cholmley http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1… ✹ sasha clarkson on 16 dec 2017 • link pepys' sir hugh, 4th baronet, succeeded his eponymous nephew, sir hugh cholmley (1662 - 1665)), 3rd baronet, son of sir william cholmley (1625-1663). it was sir william's daughter margaret who married charles turner, son of pepys' cousin jane turner. http://www.thepeerage.com/p22438.htm#i224373 ✹ san diego sarah on 6 may 2018 • link from lawson lies still in the thames by gill blanchard, amberley publishing 2017, isbn 978 1 4456 6123 pages 31-33 - 161-165 - 189: vice admiral sir john lawson probably had a tense relationship with sir hugh chomley jr. at the beginning of their task building the mole at tangier. background: sir hugh chomley sr. knew captain john lawson during the first civil war, when they protected scarborough together for parliament -- but in march, 1643 chomley unexpectedly defected to king charles. chomley sr.'s double-dealings continued, and he omits nearly all mention of his parliamentary career in his memoirs, instead blaming parliament for changing the rationale for war, failing to resupply him, and dishonoring his name. fast forward to 1662, and hugh chomley jr. arrives in tangier to work on the mole. vice admiral john lawson, rear admiral sir richard stayner, and sir edward mongagu, earl of sandwich are rebuilding and expanding the town, and had streets named after them. york castle and whitby fort were probably named for chomley jr. and his experienced miners and construction men who traveled through france and spain from yorkshire to get to tangier. until now admiral john lawson had been unforgiving towards people who had betrayed the cause. now he had to work with the son of someone he had frequently dismissed as treacherous. they must have grown to like and respect each other. upon hearing of vice admiral sir john lawson's death, the now sir hugh chomley said it was a great loss to the nation, but also to himself of a powerful, intelligent and worthy partner in their endeavor, and his dear friend. in sir john lawson's will he asked sir hugh chomley to give the lawson family whatever consideration he wished for the value of the equipment, boats and material lawson had invested in the mole. a few months later sir hugh chomley wrote the widowed lady isabelle saying that, much as he had affection for sir john, he would have to take legal action if lawson's executors didn't reimburse him for the money owed for their joint tangier endeavors, and attached detailed accounts. we do not know the resolution of this dispute, but when sir hugh chomley later met with pepys there was no mention of this disagreement. sir hugh chomley jr. omits all mention of sir john lawson in his memoir of tangier and building the mole. the son must have learned his memoir-writing skills from his father. log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1662 aug 6 oct 27 1663 jan 12 26 feb 2 6 16 17 mar 30 1664 may 20 21 jul 20 oct 20 24 dec 12 15 1665 may 13 17 nov 23 1666 jan 19 apr 14 may 11 21 24 jun 13 oct 5 6 13 15 21 nov 19 dec 12 14 1667 feb 5 14 15 22 mar 3 6 8 11 14 17 24 apr 15 may 8 13 15 31 jun 21 25 28 jul 12 19 aug 9 sep 1 16 17 23 25 oct 4 13 16 21 nov 4 8 dec 2 27 30 1668 jan 13 feb 6 28 mar 1 18 may 4 13 15 27 oct 12 14 nov 16 dec 8 1669 feb 22 mar 3 21 apr 13 21 28 latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
