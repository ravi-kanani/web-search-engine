favorite oliver, the adventurous ferret, loves to hike and kayak across the country share show dropdown tweet stumble pin it email many pets around the world adopt an adventurous life while embracing the great outdoors. oliver, the hiking ferret from denver, colorado, wasn't destined for a life dedicated to relaxation. not too long after his owner, lauren smith adopted him, she knew she is dealing with a very energetic pet. so, instead of watching him digging up another couch, she decided to introduce him with the beautiful outdoors in order to help him do something more constructive with all this energy: "i figured if it worked to take a dog out for a walk to burn off some energy, why couldn't the same work for a ferret? i began by just getting him used to wear his harness, which was a feat that involved a lot of treats," smith told people. from there, they started the process of turning little oliver into a well-trained outdoorsman, step by step. smith started taking him to short walks at the local parks around her home but soon, oliver was begging for more: "he has gotten to where he will ask to go out with me by running and standing by my front door whenever he hears it opening," smith said. now, the 4-year-old ferret is a pro! he enjoys snowy mountain climbs, kayak rides, and sand desert frolics, and all is documented on his instagram page. view list repost - vote - recaption comments ferret hiking animal photos cute animals i can has cheezburger?
