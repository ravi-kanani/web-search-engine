"but he is not giving up on his project", she added and asked them to send her boy photos of dogs instead. of course, it didn't take long before the adorable canine snapshots started pouring in and gideon could continue posting daily. but now, instead of actually getting a chance to meet all of the canines, the boy's posts are all about the dogs he "would love to pet." good for you, gideon! we will definitely continue to follow you, especially during these days. view list repost - vote - recaption comments boy dogs cute dogs twitter dog tweets i can has cheezburger?
