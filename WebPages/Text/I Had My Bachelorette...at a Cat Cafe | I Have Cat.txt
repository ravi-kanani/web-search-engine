would i fall in love with another kitty and be unable to leave without him/her? this was a serious concern. and, of course, since it was a bachelorette party: would everyone have fun? it turned out to be such a great time. we got to meet and play with a bunch of fun kitties and pet some lovely new furry friends. my maid of honor arranged for everyone to have kitty ear headbands, and she brought a bag of brand new cat toys for us to use and then donate to the kitties when we left. my friends all enjoyed the low-key nature of the party – even the ones who are allergic to cats had fun (with the help of benadryl). the employees at the café were great too and loved that i’d chosen to have my celebration with them. meet garfield **insert hearts here** the cafe itself is really nice: the décor is modern and clean, with a few tables in the central area, plus bench seating along one wall, and some snuggly chair/rug areas near the window. the kitties have tons of room to play and a lot of options for resting – there are high shelves along the walls, lots of beds and nooks to hide in, plus a few cat trees. all of the litterboxes and food stations are kept behind a curtain in the back, so they aren’t up in your face, and the kitties can go back there for some quiet time and privacy as needed. kitty treats are available for purchase as are some basic coffee drinks (provided by a café down the street). having my bachelorette party at a cat café may seem like a weird choice, but for this cat lady, it was purr-fect! i’m looking forward to going back to crumbs & whiskers soon, but with a smaller group, so i can do some serious kitty cuddling. just don’t tell my cats – they already think i don’t cuddle them enough! proof danielle’s cat ears are not permanent! danielle incorporated her cats – current and past – into her ceremony by way of charms on her bouquet. based in los angeles, ca, danielle christine can be described as: mother of cats, eater of things, part-time blogger & creative entity, and always liberal feminist. in her spare time, she can be found binge-watching excellent (and not so excellent) tv with her husband and hanging upside down off of aerial apparatuses with moderate skill. you can stalk her cats on instagram at @kieledru_and_bertie_too and @neilcatrickharris. this entry was posted in cats and tagged cat cafe, cat lady, cat woman, cat woman wednesday. bookmark the permalink. ← cat woman wednesday: foster mom & cat photographer tania hennessy kedi: much more than a film about cats in istanbul → 28 responses to i had my bachelorette party…at a cat cafe momma kat and her bear cat says: february 8, 2017 at 2:49 am hmmm … between this and the ernest hemingway house (with polydactyl cats) for the ceremony … i have my wedding planned … now i just need a good guy who isn’t allergic to cats 😉 i have cat says: february 8, 2017 at 1:41 pm so true! thought the same thing when i went to the hemingway house! did you ever read our post about my visit there?
