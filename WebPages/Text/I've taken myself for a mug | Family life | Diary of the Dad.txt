home about as seen in work with me/contact 40 before 40 newsletter disclosure privacy policy diary of the dad an award-winning uk dad blog family life i’ve taken myself for a mug by tom on friday, march 13, 2020 being a natural-born pedant, i’ve always had a bit of an issue with alanis morisette’s song, ironic. why? well, most of the examples of so-called irony cited in it aren’t ironic at all. they can mostly be attributed to misfortune or bad forward planning. rain on your wedding day, for example, is a statistical likelihood if you’re british. the one that really annoys me, though, concerns having 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife. that’s just unfathomably bad kitchen utensil management. and that, my friends, is a convoluted segue into an admission of my own shortcomings in this regard. it’s only since we moved house that i’ve realised we own a disproportionate number of mugs. seriously, we have scores of the bloody things. there are at least 10 that, legally, i have to classify as ‘previously gifted’ to keep the advertising standards authority happy. if you’re short on mugs, start a blog and they will come. we also have some nice sets my parents recently bought us, mistakenly believing we didn’t have many as we always give them drinks in the same two – our best ones, obviously. i have a tottenham hotspur one – yes, the only cup with our name on it this year – and another mug that once had a list of everything my team has ever won. but, much like the squad over the last year, it has completely faded. then there are the largely impractical novelty ones that serve simply to keep small sections of shelves free of dust. i even still have a mug or two that are older than some of my colleagues. how on earth have these borderline antique vessels avoided breakage for so long? they’ve survived three children, the same number of kitchen refits and at least four moves. not to mention our bastard cat who loves nothing more than knocking things off surfaces. of course, to keep consistent with the aforementioned song, i ought to mention something i actually need but don’t have. now, i’m being a little previous here but we are running low on tea bags and our grocery delivery this week had more than one everyday item unavailable with no substitute forthcoming. coronavirus-induced panic buying is clearly not just limited to bog roll. so, although it’s unlikely that the uk will run out of caffeine-based beverages, we could conceivably end up with an embarrassment of mugs and no tea to drink out of them. and that actually would be ironic. mugs 0 previous post next post related posts family life looking for the silver linings in worrying times family life goodbye old house, hello new home family life five things i’m looking forward to about moving house leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. comment name email website this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed. about me i'm tom briggs. a proud dad of three and, somehow or other, the writer of a multi-award-winning dad blog. i've been writing diary of the dad since 2010 and it's gone from a small hobby to my full-time job. i still have the same enthusiasm for this blog as i did when i wrote my first post and hope you enjoy reading my musings as much as i do writing them. if you're a journalist looking for a dad's point of view, you may want to check my as seen in page. similarly, if you're a pr or brand, please visit my work with me page. finally, if you want to get in touch with me, my email address is: tom@diaryofthedad.co.uk follow me as seen in recent posts looking for the silver linings in worrying times i’ve taken myself for a mug goodbye old house, hello new home five things i’m looking forward to about moving house ah well, never mind search for: awards and rankings archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 categories categories select category 40 before 40 baby and toddler blogging books budgeting charity christmas comment days out education family life fashion father’s day films food and drink football health and fitness home and garden lifestyle mother’s day motoring nine to five parenting pregnancy sleep special occasions tech toys and games travel tv uncategorized video games work theme by scissor themes proudly powered by wordpress
