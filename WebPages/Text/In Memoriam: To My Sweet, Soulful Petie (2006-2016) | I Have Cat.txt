(turn up the volume and play the clip below). my #roosters were a bit shy this morning but one spoke up – can u guess which one?? #livingwithroosters @taylorswift i feel your pain #hungry cats #cats #catvideo #catalarmclock @mardashian #petiebear a post shared by tamar arslanian (@ihavecat) on may 1, 2015 at 5:24am pdt loving time. while he wasn’t the most affectionate cat – unless food was involved he would literally “call me” to my bedroom for “loving time. it’s not as lurid as it sounds – i promise! petie would meow to get my attention then make his way to the stairs. he’d go up them, turning around every so often to make sure i was following him. once in my bedroom, he’d jump up on my bed. that was my cue to let the petting begin. paw flower. that pink nose. i called it his “mood” nose as it varied in hue, though i’m not quite sure why. often it would be injured and i’d wonder if i should get it insured – just in case! multi-color jelly beans (toe pads). especially those lovely pink ones. i’ll have to find a photo. how he hid in my closet and drawers…everywhere. i once walked all the way to work before realizing i had a one-inch trim of petie fur running around the hem of my dress. home hither poses. this sexy cross-legged look was captured by my cat sitter how his resemblance to a rabbit made me return to vegetarianism (okay, in truth a pescatarian who really wants to go vegan). he was essentially two floppy ears and a fluffy tail away from being a bunny. and it made me think about how arbitrary it is how we determine which sentient beings we turn into commodities to kill and eat and which we turn into members of our family. if you’re interested in learning more, read “a hare-raising tail” and “feline mignon” (you’ll see petie as a lamb and a rabbit!) fu manchu whiskers. his soulful human and distinctly non-feline expressions. in fact he inspired a post i wrote many moons ago about how he was a suave man caught inside a chubby cat’s body. those eyes. they were so expressive (expressing everything from fear to distain). he often seemed to be gazing off into the distance perhaps lost in his thoughts (that or nothing was going on up there and i’d prefer to think it was the former). his soulful eyes looked like those of a being who had seen a lot. i often wondered if he’d witnessed something terribly sad, or suffered before he was rescued and came into my life. or perhaps he was a human who’d seen a lot and had been reincarnated as a feline. how my sister used him as reference when shipping packages. she said determine if a package at work was more or less than 20lbs based on how heavy it felt compared to petie. in fairness, he was only 20lbs at his peak. the way he hid his head in the crook of my arm. usually when i picked him up from out of a hiding spot so he could meet a friend who wanted to see him. that fluffy belly. his long belly fur was silky soft, and smelled like linens from the four seasons or a similar high-end hotel. i never got to pet it and smell that sweet belly as much as i wanted to. to this day i mourn that i did not think to ask the vet to shave some of it for me to keep. how he filed himself away. he never sat on the shelves in my front room- none of the cats did – until i put the word cat up next to it. then petie decided it was okay to sit there. but he was the only one. they haven’t been touched in a year. i could go on, but it’s getting late. i’m worried i’m forgetting things and i don’t want to forget. i don’t want him to slip away from me… thank you for loving him. feel free to post any memories you have of him in the comment section. i leave you with some of the first photos and video of him that exist. my sweet baby petie. how i miss you so. xo a photo i took of petie – on my blackberry – the first time i saw him (l) and a photo from city critters rescue which i only saw years after adopting him (r) one of the first days in his new home (kip isn’t so sure about losing his status as an only child) forgive the terrible dorm-motif of my apartment back in 2006, but i had to share this very rare footage of kip loving on (or maybe marking?) a relatively small petie. my apologies for the poor video quality – technology has advance quite a bit in the interim!
