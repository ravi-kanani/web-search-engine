mar. 25 suggestions from our contributors to keep yourself busy at home / on the internet / socially distanced outside tonight or any other night. more suggestions on the tag. watch midwest tv a very good television show to consume during these times is joe pera talks with you (youtube tv, hulu, etc). hard to describe this program. it's about a mild-mannered chorus teacher from the upper peninsula. the episodes are short. they are weird and they are lovely and they are extremely funny. there's a big wallop of poignancy that sneaks up on you, especially if you finish the latest, second season. jo firestone is excellent in it. there are some truly excellent kid performances too (especially the kid from antarctica). joe pera talks with you speaks directly to questions like whether and how to respond to the imminent collapse of society and how to survive overwhelming personal catastrophe. the narrative of the second season revolves around the growing of a bean arch. i had already planned on growing a bean arch this year before i watched it. so while not inspired by joe pera, but in concert with, i will grow a bean arch this summer, thinking back fondly to watching those episodes last winter, during the beforetimes. ‚Äì sandy allen take vampire walks i like going outside at 2:00 am for my "daily" walk when no one else is around, wearing a hoodie, and pretending to be some sort of invulnerable night creature. i highly recommend this to others. how often do you get to prowl around your city in pitch blackness and *not* expect to be mugged/killed blah blah? lockdown vampirism is fab. ‚Äî alex marraccini play a strategy game before our current blessed epoch of animal crossing, there was into the breach (switch, steam). what makes this sci-fi turn-based strategy game so unusual is that there is absolutely no luck involved ‚Äì it's always possible to 100% every single level, even if it seems hopeless at the start. like chess, the game is completely deterministic and its rules are pretty simple; unlike chess, you only have to look a couple of turns in the future so the branching tree of possibilities is kept very much under control. i can't remember the last time i had so much fun just staring at my computer screen for ten minutes constructing the perfect set of moves in my mind, then seeing it all unfold according to plan in just ten seconds. ‚Äî adrian hon what are you doing tonight?

or is that just rats. so, i was wondering, is our problem that we've upset apollo, just like agamemnon? the ancient greek solution was to sacrifice 100 bulls in a big circle and burn their leg-bones wrapped in fat. could be worth a try. posted by kyle chayka at 10:23 no comments: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest the good instagram hunk view this post on instagram a post shared by damon bell (@damonbell) on mar 13, 2020 at 12:32pm pdt before this all started, i decided to get in shape for the millionth time. i committed to a schedule of lifting weights at the gym three times a week, cutting all my weekly carbs to essentially zero, and being sober for a few months. it worked! i lost a bit of weight and felt a lot stronger than i once was. then suddenly, i couldn't go to the gym anymore because of the germs. now, i have to workout in the house which is less fun.

(my tiktok profile is private and i have zero desire to become tiktok famous.) friends found it funny, so the next day i made one about the impending doom of covid-19 coming to the states: the lack of accurate testing, the lack of social safety net, and the unforgiving work culture. sometimes you just need some dark humor to get you through dark times. read more ¬ª posted by nicole zhu at 20:00 no comments: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: how do you do fellow kids, tiktok quitting smoking during a pandemic the first thing i wanted when all hell broke loose was a cigarette. parliament, to be specific. i don't like the discoloration that comes from smoking unfiltered cigarettes, the yellow residue left between your forefinger and middle finger that doesn't seem to ever scrub off. a cigarette lit by a tiny black bic lighter. only black. maybe white if the bodega is out of black lighters and i forgot to grab mine from the living room table. only monochromatic shades. smoking is just as much an aesthetic for me as it is an activity that keeps my anxiety at bay. i love smoking. i love it so fucking much. but when shit hit the fan and coronavirus spread across europe and hit the united states, i figured it was probably a good idea to give up something that wreaks havoc on my ability to breathe. the coronavirus is a respiratory illness. i want to continue breathing. smoking will eventually kill me, but at least it wouldn't be in the next month. that's how i thought of it, anyway. so i quit. read more ¬ª posted by julia alexander at 19:04 no comments: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest what should you do tonight?

todd haynes' brilliant queer send-up of 1950s melodrama, far from heaven. ‚Äî arielle gordon prepare to bird social distance birding. download the free merlin bird id and ebird apps from your app store & make an account. sit at your apartment window and count how many birds of each type you see in ebird (if you have binoculars or a camera with a big lens this helps). when you're tired of birding you can submit your checklist and help bird scientists around the world! ‚Äî kate wagner start an infinite tv show watch star trek: the next generation. in the series premier captain picard and his crew are asked to prove that humans have evolved beyond their violent past and deserve the right to explore the galaxy. people demonstrating compassion and generosity in the face of the unknown: it's not not relevant to our current moment. plus, riker is hot and ... so is data?

these pastel furries have it. give tom nook his blood money and join the party. for me, animal crossing is the most soothing facsimile of day-to-day life imaginable. you have chores, a mortgage, social obligations, but you're going about all of them in this gently acoustic microcosm where your most pressing task is, like, catching a butterfly for your pink poodle pal that came to town. many of the villagers are recurring characters with distinct personalities, and it's easy to develop favorites and feel like there is an actual social fabric to this virtual snowglobe. you can also visit your irl friends' towns online, which is a particular blessing in a time when even taking a walk with a friend in meatspace feels fraught. ac also proceeds in real-time with weekly/seasonal events which feels more valuable than ever for carving up the monotony of self-isolation days. you can also make toast now. what more could you want?

i own an ice cream shop in massachusetts, and as you can imagine, the current conditions are not ideal for selling ice cream. in fact, like most small businesses, we're pretty boned! in ma, we currently have the option to be open for delivery and take out, but last weekend, i made the decision to close the shop. i couldn't reasonably scream at people to stay home while making the staff show up and begging strangers to come buy ice cream. our overhead is far lower than most restaurants, so we might have been able to eke by on delivery and take out. the big concern for me is because of the seasons in boston, we're only profitable 6 months a year, +/- breakeven 2 months, and then we go ahead and lose tons of cash the other four months. all this to say, it's complicated! i spent the last week thinking about what small businesses and hospitality industry employees need right now, and really i think these ideas can be implemented across the entire economy. ultimately it comes down to putting money into small businesses so we can keep paying our bills. how will we pay for it?
