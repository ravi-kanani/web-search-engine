"underneath the stars" is a perfectly written song. so is "honey." most of her catalogue and 19 #1s, too. ‚Äî myles tanzer learn how to tie your shoes ok so something not a lot of people know about me is i'm pretty bad at tying my shoes!!! i had really bad fine motor skills as a child so i never really developed the muscle memory to...tie knots correctly. instead of going out and having fun like people did in the days of yore, i'm going to spend all weekend watching youtube videos on knot-tying until my brain oozes out of my ears! ‚Äî sophie kemp brits in greece tonight, you should watch the durrells in corfu, a charming, unexpectedly modern family sitcom set in greece in in the 1930s. it's the real-life story of the durrell family, who fled the dreary southern coast of england and moved to corfu just because, and the resulting four season adventure is bright, witty and surprisingly familiar, as the titular family feels like one you know all too well. it's available on pbs passport and amazon prime, and it's a fun adventure to leave your home where you live and spend all of your time and see the world with new friends. ‚Äî nick andersen express gratitude lately, my husband and i have begun sharing what we're grateful for before dinner each night. expressing gratitude is something that can really help tune our heads to what is positive, especially amidst this endless torrent of tragedy. our moods affect our immune systems, so taking care of our spirits in whatever ways we can is an additional method of staying vigilant during these times. ‚Äî sandy allen attend the theatre just because every theater on broadway is closed doesn't mean you can't take in a show. thanks to the youtube channel tastysurrealbowl (the joseph papp of our times?), the 1984 pbs recording of sam shepard's pulitzer-finalist play true west is available to stream in its entirety. taking place in the desert 40 miles east of la, the production stars gary sinise and john malkovich as estranged brothers housesitting for their mother. sinise plays the hack screenwriter, malkovich the loose-canon house burglar, naturally. but over a couple long days and nights with nothing but their mother's booze and each other's company, the oppressive emptiness of the desert starts to get to the pair (‚Äúthose are the most monotonous fuckin' crickets i ever heard in my life," malkovich growls to himself) and slowly the brothers switch places, the vagrant selling a script, the screenwriter stealing every toaster oven in the neighborhood. full of madness and claustrophobia and malkovich whipping pieces of toast at sinise's head, it's a perfect show for these times. in the words of a sloshed sinise, ‚Äúthis isn't champagne anymore. we went through the champagne a long time ago. this is serious stuff. the days of champagne are long gone.‚Äù ‚Äî natalie beach watch instagram cooking videos but specifically this korean cooking channel. going down the page and reading the captions of the video freeze frames is the only kind of poetry my brain can handle at the moment. ‚Äî clare mao crispy red onion sizzle~ do u want~? kiya.. hit by a car.. eat me quickly very easy ^^ very very easy ^^ dystopian city movies american cinema uses new york as a vehicle for the aspirations or anxieties present in an era, and in our current moment, the city is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, a proxy for the country's fears. aude and i have embarked on a movie marathon to see how filmmakers used the concerns present in american society to create dystopian visions for the future or alternative visions of the present. there's a comfort in knowing that their depictions of the years 1997 or 2022 look nothing like our current reality and what we are fixated on now will pass. we have expanded the concept to include how other cities are used in a similar fashion. films include: "soylent green", "escape from new york", "the warriors", "logan's run" (washington dc), "12 monkeys" (baltimore / philadelphia), "bladerunner" (la), "they live" (la), and "brazil" (london) ‚Äî michael crommett italian cinema open a heavy red wine you have been saving for a special occasion. this is the special occasion. let it breathe. rent la grande bellezza (the great beauty) by paolo sorrentino through criterion or amazon prime. watch it on the largest screen you own, with the volume as high as you can put it without being a dick to your neighbors. sit back, drink the wine, and weep as prolifically as you can. ‚Äî jennifer schaffer farmers markets i'm heading to the mcgoldrick park farmers market in greenpoint on sunday. the fish guy, pickle people and orwashers bread will definitely be there every week until down to earth markets suspends. ‚Äî jenn de la vega posted by kyle chayka at 18:00 1 comment: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: wsydt wednesday, 25 march 2020 what should you do tonight? mar. 25 suggestions from our contributors to keep yourself busy at home / on the internet / socially distanced outside tonight or any other night. more suggestions on the tag. watch midwest tv a very good television show to consume during these times is joe pera talks with you (youtube tv, hulu, etc). hard to describe this program. it's about a mild-mannered chorus teacher from the upper peninsula. the episodes are short. they are weird and they are lovely and they are extremely funny. there's a big wallop of poignancy that sneaks up on you, especially if you finish the latest, second season. jo firestone is excellent in it. there are some truly excellent kid performances too (especially the kid from antarctica). joe pera talks with you speaks directly to questions like whether and how to respond to the imminent collapse of society and how to survive overwhelming personal catastrophe. the narrative of the second season revolves around the growing of a bean arch. i had already planned on growing a bean arch this year before i watched it. so while not inspired by joe pera, but in concert with, i will grow a bean arch this summer, thinking back fondly to watching those episodes last winter, during the beforetimes. ‚Äì sandy allen take vampire walks i like going outside at 2:00 am for my "daily" walk when no one else is around, wearing a hoodie, and pretending to be some sort of invulnerable night creature. i highly recommend this to others. how often do you get to prowl around your city in pitch blackness and *not* expect to be mugged/killed blah blah? lockdown vampirism is fab. ‚Äî alex marraccini play a strategy game before our current blessed epoch of animal crossing, there was into the breach (switch, steam). what makes this sci-fi turn-based strategy game so unusual is that there is absolutely no luck involved ‚Äì it's always possible to 100% every single level, even if it seems hopeless at the start. like chess, the game is completely deterministic and its rules are pretty simple; unlike chess, you only have to look a couple of turns in the future so the branching tree of possibilities is kept very much under control. i can't remember the last time i had so much fun just staring at my computer screen for ten minutes constructing the perfect set of moves in my mind, then seeing it all unfold according to plan in just ten seconds. ‚Äî adrian hon what are you doing tonight?

mar. 24 suggestions from our contributors to keep yourself busy at home / on the internet / socially distanced outside tonight or any other night. more suggestions on the tag. watch a 90-minute movie on youtube douglas sirk's all that heaven allows is available in its entirety on youtube. it is the perfect quarantine movie. it is 90 minutes long, the platonic ideal of a time commitment. the film itself is unbelievably prismatic, nearly psychedelic‚Äîsnow so bright that it looks purple, trees buoyant and verdant as a bob ross painting, lipstick in exemplary shades of red. even on the ancient, gigantic tv set in my childhood basement, it is superficially gorgeous in a way that renders actual, lived experience comparatively dull. the plot is ideally low effort, droll and sensationalistic‚Äîjane wyman and rock hudson share deep kisses and breathlessly discuss different species of trees. there are undercurrents of the prison that is posh suburbia, but they're all shot far too beautifully to be rendered existentially depressing. pairs well with: two expired ativan (if not available, a melatonin pill or glass of red wine will do), a newfound appreciation for the trappings of domesticity. a good chaser? todd haynes' brilliant queer send-up of 1950s melodrama, far from heaven. ‚Äî arielle gordon prepare to bird social distance birding. download the free merlin bird id and ebird apps from your app store & make an account. sit at your apartment window and count how many birds of each type you see in ebird (if you have binoculars or a camera with a big lens this helps). when you're tired of birding you can submit your checklist and help bird scientists around the world! ‚Äî kate wagner start an infinite tv show watch star trek: the next generation. in the series premier captain picard and his crew are asked to prove that humans have evolved beyond their violent past and deserve the right to explore the galaxy. people demonstrating compassion and generosity in the face of the unknown: it's not not relevant to our current moment. plus, riker is hot and ... so is data? and with seven network seasons, you're not going to run out of episodes anytime soon. ‚Äî miranda popkey drink new kinds of booze i think everyone should drink a modelo chelada. they're very nice and refreshing and you can get them at any bodega, and they come in three flavors!! the concept of a canned michelada may seem gross but they're actually very nice :) the only downside is they only sell them as tallboys so you really have to commit. they will not get you drunk, which is also kinda nice. ‚Äî gaby del valle play animal crossing the sense of community you've been missing from walking around your neighborhood and seeing your friends and frenemies alike? these pastel furries have it. give tom nook his blood money and join the party. for me, animal crossing is the most soothing facsimile of day-to-day life imaginable. you have chores, a mortgage, social obligations, but you're going about all of them in this gently acoustic microcosm where your most pressing task is, like, catching a butterfly for your pink poodle pal that came to town. many of the villagers are recurring characters with distinct personalities, and it's easy to develop favorites and feel like there is an actual social fabric to this virtual snowglobe. you can also visit your irl friends' towns online, which is a particular blessing in a time when even taking a walk with a friend in meatspace feels fraught. ac also proceeds in real-time with weekly/seasonal events which feels more valuable than ever for carving up the monotony of self-isolation days. you can also make toast now. what more could you want? ‚Äî angeline rodriguez what i'm doing tonight: working my ass out of tom nook's debt on animal crossing come find me on my island. ‚Äî nick quah take a hot shower my recommendation is to take a hot shower. we can do many things to make ourselves feel better, or to take a break from our brains (or screens, or the news), but none are better than a hot shower. tend to your body. then open a window. ‚Äî molly mcardle what are you doing tonight?

mar. 23 suggestions from our contributors to keep yourself busy at home / on the internet / socially distanced outside tonight or any other night. more suggestions on the tag. magazine collage!!! if you're watching [whatever] and want to stay off your phone, i've found collaging to be a great way to give my hands and extra brain space something to do. sifting through a stack of old us weekly's cutting out silly nonsense as i watch silly nonsense is the most calming activity i know about right now. i haven't gotten very far but one thing i'm making is a psycho 25 things you don't know about me (an us weekly regular feature) in a composition notebook with a whole range of celeb answers, like "i love changing diapers. i should clarify: baby diapers, not adult diapers!" and "i took a sleep test and discovered i'm narcoleptic." glue's ordered but not yet arrived. ‚Äî meredith haggerty videos of tiny worlds i cannot stop watching terrarium-building and aquarium maintenance videos. why stress about the outside(tm) when you could get overly-invested in the well-being of a micro-ecosystem instead? oh, to be a shrimplet flitting amongst the duckweed roots... ‚Äî kait sanchez construction project here's some food for thought: lincoln logs. named after president abe "logs" lincoln, these logs are a surefire way to keep you busy. it also a great way to test the waters if you want to pivot to a career in urban planning. build paris out of logs. a waterpark. this is a great activity if you are alone, or if you have one or two people to play with, such as a brother or a childhood pet. i don't know your life. ‚Äî sophie kemp cook peppers consider making "infinity green peppers", a super simple recipe depicted in this super cute video by my old buddies lullatone in nagoya, japan (who are mostly musicians; check out the rest of their youtube for good tunes and music tutorials/experiments). "you only need: 5 green bell peppers, 1 teaspoon of sesame seed oil, 1 teaspoon of chinese chicken stock, a pinch of salt, and a sprinkle of white sesame seeds." ‚Äî samantha culp posted by kyle chayka at 20:00 no comments: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: wsydt friday, 20 march 2020 what should you do tonight?

our contributors have some suggestions. do back exercises this is a video of a weirdly buff older asian man doing some simple back exercises. i don't think/know if it will fix scoliosis (seems like a big thing to promise) but it makes my back feel better after being hunched over at my weird makeshift wfh setup (laptop stacked on top of 5 books i will never read, including obama's dreams from my father; larissa's apple keyboard; a gaming mouse my capricorn bf gifted me close enough to valentine's day that i've started saying it was for valentine's day) for 6-8 hours every day. and it's easy to do. and also this man is kind of hot. ‚Äî clare mao read more ¬ª posted by kyle chayka at 20:00 1 comment: email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: plans, wsydt older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) search this blog one good post i wrote down everything i bought for a week (aude white) towards the very bottom of the list of non-human coronavirus casualties as organized by ‚Äúdang, that‚Äôs a shame,‚Äù well belo... follow us on twitter blog roll the awl corona virus twitter.com quarantine web ring delirium we are food bloggers now total pageviews popular posts estate sales vs quarantine i. i was broke and needed stuff, which is how it began. my sister and i had just driven our 1999 subaru legacy from new haven... wife under quarantine somewhat unexpectedly and not too long ago, i became a wife. i always assumed that if i ever did get married it would be at age 70 f... i wrote down everything i bought for a week (aude white) towards the very bottom of the list of non-human coronavirus casualties as organized by ‚Äúdang, that‚Äôs a shame,‚Äù well belo... jenn's bean diaries, #1 well before ~the virus~ became a thing, i used a delivery service for my restaurant supply. as a caterer, it's pretty normal. for a p... i know it, i can't feel it they keep paying me to blog about how it's all medically necessary, but when push comes to covid it's one of the first to go. now... the pandemic is getting worse but at least the birds were on one today i have a dog, and he requires walking. i have a passion, birdwatching, and this passion is sated simultaneously while the dog is walked. whe... this has all happened before i went out to a bar with my girlfriend after work last night. i know that's a social distancing no-no, but neither of us knew how long i... summer 1936 ted cruz quote-tweeted alexandra ocazio-cortez to affirm her opinion today. so i got on a zoom call with two former vox media colleagues and... did she always know if you know who this is, then you know what this is: (if you don't, quick primer: it's the running animated illustration that a... twitter bad for those of us who use twitter frequently (a decidedly terrible fate), a common observation is that twitter always thinks we're approac... comments from our community get this recent comments widget contributors aaron cohen adrian hon alex press alexandra marraccini aliceoutofcontext andrea whittle anna hezel aude white ben bijan stephen brendan klinkenberg caroline eisenmann chloe cooper jones chris cooper lund corbin cleary gabrielle bluestone gaby del valle hagi harron walker ianfrisch jaime fuller janel drewis jennifer schaffer jillian josh kramer k lozano kaitlyn tiffany kevin nguyen kurt melby kyle chayka luis paez-pumar matthew zeitlin matthew megan farokhmanesh meredith haggerty miranda popkey molly muffy crosswire natalie beach nausicaa renner nick andersen nicole he nikki shaner-bradford p.e. moskowitz rachel bell rachel reyhan harmanci robyn kanner samantha culp sandy allen shane sophie frances taylor lorenz thessaly tina nguyen vijith assar zack kotzer alanna angeline rodriguez bradley babendir bryan washington cale guthrie weissman clare daisy danny schwartz darcie wilder jenn dlv jmrivera02 julia alexander kait sanchez kate wagner larissa pham lauren michelle delgado myles nick quah nicole clark nicole zhu nixie staceyanderson summer anne burton terry nguyen blog archive ‚ñº 2020 (153) ‚ñº march (153) what should you do tonight?
