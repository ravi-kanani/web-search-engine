indoor voices ü§´ü§´ü§´ stuff to read while you‚Äôre trying not to go viral about home about banner stories we liked: no kissing your phone! *** post-plague anxiety *** pro handwashing strats *** emails *** it's real weird to go outside rn *** tuesday, 24 march 2020 what kind of help do small businesses need? i own an ice cream shop in massachusetts, and as you can imagine, the current conditions are not ideal for selling ice cream. in fact, like most small businesses, we're pretty boned! in ma, we currently have the option to be open for delivery and take out, but last weekend, i made the decision to close the shop. i couldn't reasonably scream at people to stay home while making the staff show up and begging strangers to come buy ice cream. our overhead is far lower than most restaurants, so we might have been able to eke by on delivery and take out. the big concern for me is because of the seasons in boston, we're only profitable 6 months a year, +/- breakeven 2 months, and then we go ahead and lose tons of cash the other four months. all this to say, it's complicated! i spent the last week thinking about what small businesses and hospitality industry employees need right now, and really i think these ideas can be implemented across the entire economy. ultimately it comes down to putting money into small businesses so we can keep paying our bills. how will we pay for it? we don't need to pay for it because money is imaginary. go ahead and mint the coin already. i don't know if any of these are feasible, but some must be. there are a few different programs available at the moment which issue low or no interest loans. these aren't especially helpful to small businesses because we generally operate on such low margins it would be impossible to ever catch up. additionally, most of these loans require personal guarantees, which means that small business owners on the brink of losing their entire business, might take one of these loans and if they default a few months down the line, the end up losing everything anyway, but now they lose everything else they've got, too. banks and bank regulators should get together to waive interest payments on mortgages and defer payments at no penalty for at least 3 months. any landlord who accepts this offer must prove they have completely passed the relief on to their tenants. landlords who do this should be allowed to extend the lease by 3 months if they choose. if this doesn't work, regulators and municipalities should also look at reducing property tax payments for any landlord who proves they have reduced their tenants' rent. this would work for commercial and residential leases. cell phone companies and internet providers should provide fee-free service for at least 3 months to current subscribers impacted by restaurant and bar closures. sales tax payments to state and local governments for the past x months should be given back to businesses who prove they've distributed this money to their employees. some states have deferred sales tax payments for a few months, but they're still eventually owed. credit cart transaction fees, delivery commissions, payroll and scheduling software fees for the past x months should be given back to businesses who prove they've distributed this money to their employees. why would they do this? if they don't they're going to have far fewer companies in a few months anyway. (a quick note on the difference between waiver and deferral: if a fee is waived, it is not owed. if a fee is deferred, it is owed at a later date, which helps a little, but not a lot. grubhub got great headlines for saying they were waiving their fees, but what they actually implemented was a deferral. restaurants accepting this offer will eventually owe commissions on all their orders during this time.) transportation isn't too big of a deal with everyone stuck at home at the moment, but car payments will still be due. banks should offer no fee deferral of payment for 3 months, and public transportation should be offered for free to impacted hospitality workers once things get going again. rules and restrictions on unemployment benefits must be temporarily relaxed to allow for immediate relief for impacted employees. lots of states are making progress on this, but it's not enough. for example, jan and feb are slower months in the hospitality industry (especially ice cream!), so potential payouts to employees will be lower if calculations are base on last two quarters. additionally, seasonal staff who just started work this month will have next to no earnings the last two quarters. there are probably other things city, state, and federal officials can and must do, but this is a start. if you are a customer of a small business here are some things you can do to help them: if they're still open for delivery and take out and you're comfortable with it, order delivery and take out from them. be patient if things take longer than before. if you can afford it, tip extravagantly, even an extra couple dollars will make a huge difference to the employees. if possible order delivery or take out direct from the restaurant so they can avoid commissions from the delivery companies which routinely run to over 30% of the sale. if the business has accounts on social channels, follow them there. if they have an email list, sign up for it. when they post something interesting, amplify it to your network. do anything you can to help them get the message out. if you love a place, chances are your friend will too. leave a review on google or facebook, or yelp if you have to. these help! buy some merch from the restaurant. we make very nice merch including the softest ice cream weather sweatshirt you'll ever wear. if you get a gift card, consider waiting until things settle down before using it. posted by aaron cohen at 18:16 email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest no comments: post a comment newer post older post home subscribe to: post comments (atom) search this blog one good post i wrote down everything i bought for a week (aude white) towards the very bottom of the list of non-human coronavirus casualties as organized by ‚Äúdang, that‚Äôs a shame,‚Äù well belo... follow us on twitter blog roll the awl corona virus twitter.com quarantine web ring delirium we are food bloggers now total pageviews popular posts estate sales vs quarantine i. i was broke and needed stuff, which is how it began. my sister and i had just driven our 1999 subaru legacy from new haven... wife under quarantine somewhat unexpectedly and not too long ago, i became a wife. i always assumed that if i ever did get married it would be at age 70 f... i wrote down everything i bought for a week (aude white) towards the very bottom of the list of non-human coronavirus casualties as organized by ‚Äúdang, that‚Äôs a shame,‚Äù well belo... jenn's bean diaries, #1 well before ~the virus~ became a thing, i used a delivery service for my restaurant supply. as a caterer, it's pretty normal. for a p... i know it, i can't feel it they keep paying me to blog about how it's all medically necessary, but when push comes to covid it's one of the first to go. now... the pandemic is getting worse but at least the birds were on one today i have a dog, and he requires walking. i have a passion, birdwatching, and this passion is sated simultaneously while the dog is walked. whe... this has all happened before i went out to a bar with my girlfriend after work last night. i know that's a social distancing no-no, but neither of us knew how long i... summer 1936 ted cruz quote-tweeted alexandra ocazio-cortez to affirm her opinion today. so i got on a zoom call with two former vox media colleagues and... did she always know if you know who this is, then you know what this is: (if you don't, quick primer: it's the running animated illustration that a... twitter bad for those of us who use twitter frequently (a decidedly terrible fate), a common observation is that twitter always thinks we're approac... comments from our community get this recent comments widget contributors aaron cohen adrian hon alex press alexandra marraccini aliceoutofcontext andrea whittle anna hezel aude white ben bijan stephen brendan klinkenberg caroline eisenmann chloe cooper jones chris cooper lund corbin cleary gabrielle bluestone gaby del valle hagi harron walker ianfrisch jaime fuller janel drewis jennifer schaffer jillian josh kramer k lozano kaitlyn tiffany kevin nguyen kurt melby kyle chayka luis paez-pumar matthew zeitlin matthew megan farokhmanesh meredith haggerty miranda popkey molly muffy crosswire natalie beach nausicaa renner nick andersen nicole he nikki shaner-bradford p.e. moskowitz rachel bell rachel reyhan harmanci robyn kanner samantha culp sandy allen shane sophie frances taylor lorenz thessaly tina nguyen vijith assar zack kotzer alanna angeline rodriguez bradley babendir bryan washington cale guthrie weissman clare daisy danny schwartz darcie wilder jenn dlv jmrivera02 julia alexander kait sanchez kate wagner larissa pham lauren michelle delgado myles nick quah nicole clark nicole zhu nixie staceyanderson summer anne burton terry nguyen blog archive ‚ñº 2020 (153) ‚ñº march (153) what should you do tonight? mar. 27 there should be lifestyle anarchy oh, so you have a second home? raising awareness, now more than ever!
