indoor voices 🤫🤫🤫 stuff to read while you’re trying not to go viral about home about banner stories we liked: no kissing your phone! *** post-plague anxiety *** pro handwashing strats *** emails *** it's real weird to go outside rn *** sunday, 22 march 2020 more beauty tips these are products i've used off and on for years, but today i used them in an almost-militant attempt to agree with myself that i do live in a body and i do want it to feel and look a certain way right now, despite many days of feeling to the contrary and i'm sure many more to come. - clairol root touch-ups. it's subtle enough that it blends in with most new growth. my color is 5r; when i was younger i went for a much more dramatic red, but now it's muted enough that i almost forget it isn't real, even though it's been 15 years. - essie gel couture. i used to bite my nails, and this helped a lot. it lasts a really long time, much longer than any other drugstore polish i've ever used. now not biting my nails feels like a civic duty! - sally hansen spa wax. this one is a lie; i didn't use it today (i did shave — a brag), but i used to a lot. it heats up in the microwave and does a decent job. it once came in a lavender scent, which appears to be discontinued, and always made me feel like a fancy lady, like i wasn't systematically ripping out follicles using something i'd just nuked in my kitchen. - get in touch with your usual nail salon, or haircutter, or waxer, if you can, and venmo or paypal them the money you'd normally spend on an appointment, if you can. posted by alanna at 20:37 email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest no comments: post a comment newer post older post home subscribe to: post comments (atom) search this blog one good post i wrote down everything i bought for a week (aude white) towards the very bottom of the list of non-human coronavirus casualties as organized by “dang, that’s a shame,” well belo... follow us on twitter blog roll the awl corona virus twitter.com quarantine web ring delirium we are food bloggers now total pageviews popular posts estate sales vs quarantine i. i was broke and needed stuff, which is how it began. my sister and i had just driven our 1999 subaru legacy from new haven... wife under quarantine somewhat unexpectedly and not too long ago, i became a wife. i always assumed that if i ever did get married it would be at age 70 f... i wrote down everything i bought for a week (aude white) towards the very bottom of the list of non-human coronavirus casualties as organized by “dang, that’s a shame,” well belo... jenn's bean diaries, #1 well before ~the virus~ became a thing, i used a delivery service for my restaurant supply. as a caterer, it's pretty normal. for a p... i know it, i can't feel it they keep paying me to blog about how it's all medically necessary, but when push comes to covid it's one of the first to go. now... the pandemic is getting worse but at least the birds were on one today i have a dog, and he requires walking. i have a passion, birdwatching, and this passion is sated simultaneously while the dog is walked. whe... this has all happened before i went out to a bar with my girlfriend after work last night. i know that's a social distancing no-no, but neither of us knew how long i... summer 1936 ted cruz quote-tweeted alexandra ocazio-cortez to affirm her opinion today. so i got on a zoom call with two former vox media colleagues and... did she always know if you know who this is, then you know what this is: (if you don't, quick primer: it's the running animated illustration that a... twitter bad for those of us who use twitter frequently (a decidedly terrible fate), a common observation is that twitter always thinks we're approac... comments from our community get this recent comments widget contributors aaron cohen adrian hon alex press alexandra marraccini aliceoutofcontext andrea whittle anna hezel aude white ben bijan stephen brendan klinkenberg caroline eisenmann chloe cooper jones chris cooper lund corbin cleary gabrielle bluestone gaby del valle hagi harron walker ianfrisch jaime fuller janel drewis jennifer schaffer jillian josh kramer k lozano kaitlyn tiffany kevin nguyen kurt melby kyle chayka luis paez-pumar matthew zeitlin matthew megan farokhmanesh meredith haggerty miranda popkey molly muffy crosswire natalie beach nausicaa renner nick andersen nicole he nikki shaner-bradford p.e. moskowitz rachel bell rachel reyhan harmanci robyn kanner samantha culp sandy allen shane sophie frances taylor lorenz thessaly tina nguyen vijith assar zack kotzer alanna angeline rodriguez bradley babendir bryan washington cale guthrie weissman clare daisy danny schwartz darcie wilder jenn dlv jmrivera02 julia alexander kait sanchez kate wagner larissa pham lauren michelle delgado myles nick quah nicole clark nicole zhu nixie staceyanderson summer anne burton terry nguyen blog archive ▼ 2020 (153) ▼ march (153) what should you do tonight?
