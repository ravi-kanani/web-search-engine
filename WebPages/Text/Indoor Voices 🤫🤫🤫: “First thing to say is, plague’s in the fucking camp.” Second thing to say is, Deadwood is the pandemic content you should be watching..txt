indoor voices ü§´ü§´ü§´ stuff to read while you‚Äôre trying not to go viral about home about banner stories we liked: no kissing your phone! *** post-plague anxiety *** pro handwashing strats *** emails *** it's real weird to go outside rn *** saturday, 21 march 2020 ‚Äúfirst thing to say is, plague‚Äôs in the fucking camp.‚Äù second thing to say is, deadwood is the pandemic content you should be watching. fish gotta swim, bird gotta fly, and i gotta keep trying to convince all you hoopleheads to watch deadwood. this time though, i have you right where i want you: cabin-fevered and out of episodes of love is blind. just as wild bill hickok‚Äôs luck at the poker table ran out, so too have your years of excuses not to watch a mere three seasons of the greatest tv drama ever made. but, if you need one final reason to make camp in the black hills of south dakota, a last little nudge to embrace what has been described as, ‚Äúa western, a gangster picture, a political drama, a lewd farce, and a comedy of manners; an operatic potboiler chock-full of sex, violence, and profanity; a sustained long-form narrative that interweaves parallel plots tighter than a hangman‚Äôs rope‚Äù ‚Äî let me just add that in season one deadwood is also a story about a community combatting a plague. now, it has certainly come to my attention that you‚Äôre all consuming pandemic content like whiskey on the house and half-priced pussy. but tell me, does contagion feature the great robin weigert as calamity jane putting her boozing aside to tend to strangers infected with smallpox? does your precious outbreak crescendo with the saloon proprietors, pimps, newspaperman, and dying reverend of the town gathering over canned fruit to organize community aid? while other plague stories play-up the disgusting enormity of the disaster, be it a world war of zombies or goop‚Äôs scalp peeling from her head, the plague arc on deadwood (episodes five through eight of season one) is notable for its depiction of intimacy, and the small ways we care for each other. ‚Äúnow i‚Äôm gonna lay this cloth on your fuckin‚Äô lips,‚Äù jane tells joey, a boy dispatched to cheyenne to collect the vaccine but taken sick before he made it. in david milch‚Äôs telling, a threat from outside the camp does not require the heroics of a few good men, but a response from the collective, one that recognizes each individual as comprising a single body. the plague‚Äôs arrival in town coincides with the funeral for wild bill, whose eulogy taken from corinthians and delivered by reverend smith, exemplifies this philosophy: ‚Äú‚Ä¶.for the body is not one member but many‚Ä¶.the eye cannot say unto the hand, 'i have no need of thee.' nor again the head to the feet, 'i have no need of thee.' nay, much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble, and those members of the body which we think of as less honorable, are all necessary. [saint paul tells us] that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care, one to another, and where the one member suffer, all the members suffer with it.‚Äù when one member of a community, no matter how "unproductive" or ignoble, becomes sick, it becomes everyone‚Äôs responsibility to become a caregiver. in this way, untold lives are saved by the generosity of civic leaders nee murderous pimps, the gruff selflessness of doc cochran (brad dourif hive come through), and the measured reporting from the black hills pioneer ‚Äî ‚Äúgive some sort of positive angle to it,‚Äù swearengen orders the paper‚Äôs proprietor as he drafts the writeup. ‚Äú‚Äòvaccine‚Äôs on its way or it looks like it‚Äôs the mild fucking type‚Ä¶.nip that sodom and gomorrah shit in the bud.‚Äô‚Äù but it can‚Äôt all be care ethics and a progressive interpretation of scripture. deadwood is ultimately a show about the bloody rise of unfettered capitalism, and the process by which value is extracted from the human body as violently as the gold is blasted from the black hills. after all, the plague arrives via andy cramed, a conman come to town to run a grift with cy tolliver, the owner of the upscale brothel the bella union. tolliver may be the wealthiest and cleanest man in town, but his silk cravats cover up an abuser and a killer. when cy learns that his buddy has smallpox, he instructs his thugs to drag cramed to the woods to die. then, he quietly sends poor joey off to collect the vaccine, putting his business interests and reputation over the wellbeing of the camp. (stop me if you‚Äôve heard this one before.) when the town eventually learns that the plague is among them, lives are already being lost. ‚Äúyou sat on the news, no one went after the meds, and i‚Äôm asking the duration,‚Äù swearengen growls when he confronts cy, asking the same questions that we are now. ‚Äúand i‚Äôm saying asking questions in that tone and pointing your finger at me will get you told to go fuck yourself,‚Äù cy responds, in the manner of our president at a recent press conference. i could go on running my cunt mouth about this show until quarantine ends, though we don‚Äôt know when that will be. what we do know: we are part of one body and in this together, ‚Äútv‚Äôs greatest unfinished masterpiece‚Äù lies just a few clicks of your remote away, for true deadwood scholarship seek out the work of emily vanderwerff, matt zoller seitz, and mark singer‚Äôs fantastic new yorker profile of david milch, and finally, to pass along advice on making it through a plague from the indomitable al swearengen, ‚Äúthe point is for no one to raise their fucking dresses over their heads. you wait it out. you outlast the cocksucker.‚Äù posted by natalie beach at 21:08 email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest 2 comments: josh kramer23 march 2020 at 21:15 aw yeah, where my hoopleheads at?
