autarky means a cramped, sclerotic world. there is a reason that the 1970s sitcom, the good life, was indeed a comedy because it took the piss out of the idea of freeing oneself of a complex division of labour. it brings enormous costs. protectionism, like its twin, anti-trust, are often the playthings of sore losers in business, and hit the consumer or smaller-scale entrepreneur. we should not lose sight of the enormous gains made since the end of the berlin wall and wider expansion of trade. the current disruption should encourage a more clear-eyed understanding of the risks of doing business with dictatorships and closed societies such as china, and a need to find alternatives where possible. wholesale theft of intellectual property can no longer be tolerated as easily as in the past. how to deal with that remains a difficult question. on the need to avoid undue risk, it is worth pondering the following: according to the us broadcaster tucker carlson, 95 per cent of generic drugs used in the us are imported from china, although i am not sure what he uses as a data source for this. most good investors understand the need for good portfolio diversification, so the same surely will apply to supply chains after this virus episode. the developments might also encourage, or they should, a more self-reliance culture (people should learn first aid, store more non-perishable foods at home and other necessities), and in countries where people have not become too sheeplike, encourage a more robust approach to self-defence and respect for property. imagine what happens if looting breaks out in certain situations. another takeway: this horrible episode has put certain rather silly (at least they are to me) concerns into perspective: pc pronouns for certain genders, “woke” remakes of action films like the much-delayed bond film, “cancel culture”, etc. it might even remind people that screaming that the world is coming to an end unless we switch off industrial civilisation right now is so silly, and so monstrous, that it blunts the public to legitimate worries out there. greta needs to put a sock in it, and go back to school and hit the books. and the man formerly known as prince harry simply must, for our sanity, fuck off. march 12th, 2020 | 51 comments how a standard rut gauge created a standard rail gauge brian micklethwait (london) · economics, business & globalization · historical views · international affairs · transport some mapporn: this is a map of the world’s different railway gauges. fun fact, if fact it be. in the schmoozing after a talk i attended earlier in the week, someone told me that britain’s four foot eight-and-a-half inch gauge is the result of how far apart horse-drawn carriages had their wheels, in the pre-railways north-east of england, that being where the railways in britain got started. the point being that such carriages also had a standard gauge. their wheels dug ruts in the un-tarred roads of those times, so if your carriage had a different “gauge”, it couldn’t travel in those ruts, and thus couldn’t travel at all. these ruts were rails before rails. and that regular distance apart transferred itself to the newly emerging railways. i haven’t checked this. i didn’t want to bother with any facts that might destroy my story, until i’d told my story. but as of now: feel free to destroy away. another question: will the railway gauges of the world ever change? by which i mean get somewhat less numerous. say: as a result of some sort of new intercontinental high speed rail system being developed. i seem to recall reading that in spain, the new high speed trains are the same gauge as those in france (and thus also britain) and different from the regular spanish gauge. or would a some futuristic global high speed system will just add yet another standard? (will brunel’s preferred seven foot gauge for the old great western line rise from the dead and conquer the world? guess: no.) cue the commentariat who will, i predict, change the subject to the qwerty keyboard, and then disagree about how that happened, and about how keyboards will be in two hundred years time. february 27th, 2020 | 18 comments five, six, seven, eight, who do we assassinate? natalie solent (essex) · international affairs · middle east & islamic · north american affairs · self defence & security please try not to get arrested, but in the shadow of the assassination of qasem soleimani, might it not be interesting to have a discussion about the rights and wrongs of assassination? most states, most of the time, follow a rough convention that important government employees – heads of state, government ministers, top brass et cetera – of state a do not assassinate their counterparts in state b, however wicked those counterparts may be. president trump has shown himself indifferent to that convention. he could be praised for his courage (including personal courage: his own risk of being assassinated has obviously gone up) or damned for his disregard of the evil consequences that are likely to fall on others. in a world where national leaders target each other, wars are more likely. or are they? did the fact that men like soleimani could kill minor employees of other governments, not to mention civilians, without much personal risk, actually smooth the path to war? it does seem unjust that those steeped in guilt are sacrosanct while relatively innocent spear-carriers are acceptable targets. here is another question for us and anyone watching us to ponder. many people have argued strongly over the last few hours that president trump was right to break the convention of the immunity from assassination of senior state employees. but i have heard no one argue against the convention that only senior state employees can order assassinations. added later: in the comments “chester draws” made a very relevant point: there is a convention that political leaders are not killed. there is also a convention — literally — that embassies are not to be attacked. iran broke that one first. and then again recently. that fact alone, that until now the islamic republic of iran got away scot-free with invading an embassy and kidnapping diplomats, made me much more willing to approve the unconventional killing of a representative of that government. let those who boast that the rules do not apply to them learn that in that case the rules do not apply to them. january 4th, 2020 | 104 comments - (comments are closed) free carlos ghosn rob fisher (surrey) · civil liberty & regulation · international affairs in other low probability news, carlos ghosn has escaped from house arrest in japan, possibly in a cello double bass case. mr ghosn strikes quite the randian hero. grandson of a lebanese entrepreneur living in brazil with a nigerian mother, he moved to france to study and then moved his way up the ranks in michelin tyre factories. after 3 years there he was a plant manager. after 18 years he was ceo of michelin north america. then he went to work at post-privatisation renault and made it profitable. he took on roles at nissan, too, an by 2005 he was ceo of both renault and nissan. in 2016 he became chairman of mitsubishi too. maybe he upset someone at nissan because they reported him to the japanese government for under-reporting his compensation to the japanese government. now he is “suspected of masterminding a long-running scheme to mislead financial authorities”, the worst possible crime in the view of authorities but considered not at all immoral in these parts. he has also generally been attracting the ire of people who do not like it when other people earn a lot of money. “in 2016, emmanuel macron, the french president, who was at the time the finance minister, pressured renault into reducing mr. ghosn’s compensation.” i mean, what the fuck? fuck off macron. “his own pay far outstripped those of his counterparts in japan — he earned four times the pay of toyota’s chairman in 2017 — and he was unrepentant.” that is definitely randian hero territory. they want you to repent. but never repent! it will not help you. ghosn says it was all plot and treason by nissan executives who did not want him to integrate nissan, mitsubishi and renault. one problem is that once japanese authorities decide to prosecute, they nearly always get a conviction. running away was probably his only option. but it is hard to escape from the world government. interpol want him, turkish authorities arrested pilots who helped him escape, and now the lebanese authorities are hauling him in front of judges. it remains to be seen how helpful they will be. there is no extradition deal between lebanon and japan. january 3rd, 2020 | 22 comments - (comments are closed) the forgotten defence of the falklands patrick crozier (twickenham) · international affairs april 2, 1982 is a date seared into my memory, for that was the day that argentina invaded the falklands: british sovereign territory. (or should that be european sovereign territory? not quite sure.) anyway, it happened and it was humiliating and doubtless felt just as keenly in paris as in london. as we all know the islands were soon recaptured but i’ve always been curious as to what happened in that initial defence on april 2. all i’ve “known” is that the defenders were massively outnumbered and it was all over pretty quickly, there was no defence to the last man and only one argentine was killed. was it really that perfunctory? well, according to ricky d. phillips in the first casualty it wasn’t, not by a long chalk. according to the royal marine garrison they (and, ahem, “others”) put up the best defence possible, despite being outnumbered 100 to 1. in doing so the defenders managed to kill 60 argentines, knock out one tracked vehicle and one landing craft. all that for no british casualties which is all the more remarkable when you consider that there is an awful lot of talk in the book about incoming fire being “heavy and accurate” and that the marines’ plan started to go wrong more or less immediately. so, why haven’t we heard this story? why didn’t we hear it at the time? and why the continuing confusion over something as seemingly straightforward as the body count? phillips tries to answer this. one of the problems is the fog of war. perhaps that should be the “smoke of war”. what colour was that smokebomb he asks? one eyewitness says white, another purple, other answers include red, yellow and green. multiply that sort of confusion over something so simple a few times and you end up with a lot of uncertainty. and this is a small engagement involving small numbers over a short period of time. the argentine dictatorship had no interest in publicising a story of substantial argentine losses – a position that persists to this day. british officialdom, on the other hand, were in no position to count although falkland islanders saw plenty of “erics”, as they came to term dead argentines. when it comes to why it has taken so long for the story to come out phillips theorises that the british government wanted to curry favour with world opinion. i am not sure i buy that, surely a story of stout defence would indicate to the world that you care? perhaps a clue lies in the reaction of a fellow samizdatista at the time. while i was incandescent with rage, he could not believe that britain was attempting to retake the islands. for a lot of britons – especially those at the foreign office – who had gone through the loss of empire it must have seemed like just another chapter in a familiar story. for us younger ones, if felt like there was a principle at stake and an important one at that. mind you, as phillips points out argentines felt just as strongly. i suspect that the foreign office was all ready to dole out a story of capitulation. it took time for margaret thatcher to make it clear that that wasn’t going to happen and by that time there were bigger issues than the honour of the falklands’ defenders. the first casualty is not without its lighter moments. for instance, argentine troops were bewildered when it turned out that the “liberated” falkland islanders didn’t speak spanish. more amusing is the tale of a wizened old admiral being brought in to look at the invasion plans. “fascinating,” he said, “now where are your plans for taking london.” they thought he was mad. he thought they were mad. and, as it turned out, he was right. some – mainly wikipedia editors – have questioned phillips’s credibility. all i can say is that if it’s a pack of lies it’s a good one. there is a lot of detail, a lot of thought and a lot of doubt. december 21st, 2019 | 42 comments - (comments are closed) samizdata quote of the day brian micklethwait (london) · historical views · international affairs · slogans & quotations · uk affairs what is the intellectual origin of the foreign policy views of jeremy corbyn’s inner circle? it is lenin’s theory of imperialism. in the early 20th century, building on the work of liberals such as john hobson, lenin argued that capitalism was being sustained only by the profits from colonial exploitation. these excess profits allowed domestic workers to be paid enough to prevent them from rising up against their capitalist employers. imperialism was made possible by the power of capitalists to make the state provide military and political protection for their foreign investments. from this two things follow. all foreign policy by capitalist countries is about creating empires, conquering property and exploiting resources. kosovo as much as iraq, sierra leone as much as afghanistan, troops in west germany as much as in vietnam. hence mr corbyn’s jaundiced view of nato and any institutions connected with it, such as the european union. so mr corbyn argues, as he did in 2011, that “since world war two, the big imperial force has been the united states on behalf of global capitalism and the biggest, mostly us-based corporations. the propaganda for this has presented itself as a voice for ‘freedom’ and carefully and consciously conflated it with market economics.” the second thing that follows is that the troops on the front line of the movement to overthrow capitalism are national resistance movements. these are the heroes of socialist advance, even if sometimes they aren’t purely socialist. so mr corbyn has given encouragement and support to the iranian government, the irish republicans, hamas and hezbollah, and fidel castro. he saw hugo chávez and nicolás maduro of venezuela as lights to the world, developing a new economic model worth emulating…. the labour leader ignores or dismisses the idea that any of these groups or countries, such as iran, might be imperialist powers because all that matters is that they resist western capitalist imperialism. so their imperialism, like that of the soviet union, is, he put it, “different”. where resistance movements have turned to violence or fundamentalism mr corbyn says he disapproves but that the root cause is not their behaviour but ours…. there will be some who read this and will think i’m being unfair because i mentioned lenin and hezbollah and there is an election coming. but this article is unfair only if it’s an inaccurate description of mr corbyn’s views, and given that it is based on things he and his close advisers have written and said, it can’t be. if mr corbyn becomes prime minister he and his advisers will control foreign policy. given that he departs so far from the postwar consensus and the traditional labour position, it’s as well to understand what he thinks. – daniel finkelstein, in a piece behind the times paywall, but quoted (all of the above and more) by mick hartley. december 5th, 2019 | 14 comments - (comments are closed) how to defeat the chinese communists brian micklethwait (london) · activism · chinese affairs · economics, business & globalization · historical views · international affairs · opinions on liberty how can the hongkongers defeat the chinese communists (hereinafter termed chicoms), and preserve their hongkonger way of life approximately as it now is? in the short run, they probably can’t. during the next few months, the chicom repression in hong kong will surely get ever nastier, and the bigger plan, to just gobble it up and digest it into chicom china will surely bash onwards. but then again, i thought that these hong kong demonstrations would all be snuffed out months ago. so what the hell do i know? i thought they’d just send in the tanks, and to hell with “world opinion”. but the chicoms, it turned out, didn’t want to just kill everyone who dared to disobey, plus anyone else who happened to be standing about nearby. that would not be a good look for them. what are they? russians? far too unsophisticated. instead the plan has been to divide and conquer, and it presumably still is. by putting violent agent provovateurs in among the demonstrators, and by ramping up the violence simultaneously perpetrated by the police, the plan was, and is, to turn the peaceful and hugely well attended demonstrations into far smaller, far more violent street battles of the sort that would disgust regular people. who would then turn around and support law and order, increased spending on public housing, blah blah. so far, this has not worked. and for as long as any chicom plan for hong kong continues not to work, “world opinion” has that much more time to shake itself free from the sneer quotes and get itself organised, to try to help hong kong to stay semi-free. those district rat-catcher (or whatever) elections last sunday came at just the wrong time for the chicoms, because they gave peaceful hongkongers the chance to make their opinions known, about creatures of a far more significant sort than rats, and at just the time when the chicom plan should have started seriously shutting the hongkongers up. these elections were a landslide. the chicoms are very keen to exude indifference to world opinion, but they clearly do care about it, because if they truly didn’t care about it, those tanks would have gone in months ago, just as i had assumed they would. so, since world opinion clearly has some effect, the first thing the rest of us can do to help the hongkongers is to keep our eyeballs on hong kong. as i say, i continue to be pessimistic about the medium-term future in hong kong. but in the longer run, if the hongkongers can’t have a local victory, they can set about getting their revenge. and all of the rest of us who care can join in and help them. we, the hongkongers and all their supporters around the world, can start talking seriously about toppling the chicoms, not just by continuing to contest hong kong, but also by talking about china as a whole. if the chicoms won’t let hong kong be, then the hongkongers have a perfect right to start talking about china as a whole, since that’s what is now trying to swallow them up. if they aren’t allowed the distinct and distinctly better system that they were promised, then the only system they are allowed becomes fair game for their complaints and for their recommendations. that’s a claim that will make sense to anyone able to think for themselves. it won’t persuade the chicoms, but persuading everyone else in the world with a clutch of honest brain cells to rub together is a fine start. what needs to happen is some re-framing. → continue reading: how to defeat the chinese communists november 28th, 2019 | 77 comments - (comments are closed) south park says sorry brian micklethwait (london) · arts & entertainment · chinese affairs · civil liberty & regulation · international affairs yes, south park grovels: some background here: after the “band in china” episode mocked hollywood for shaping its content to please the chinese government, beijing has responded by deleting all clips, episodes and discussions of the comedy central show. south park creators trey parker and matt stone probably saw this coming, and to their credit, simply didn’t care. from the point of view of the chinese government there are far too many people now paying quite close attention to them, whom they do not control. the people presiding over communist despotisms are always touted as strategic geniuses, but i sense a change in the world. or then again, it could just be that i attended an excellent talk about hong kong last night, and will be attending another talk about hong kong on wednesday, at the asi. that link may not last, so i note here that a lady called denise ho will be speaking. that second link is to a report in the guardian, which it makes a nice change for us here to be agreeing with, assuming most of us do. the chinese government is now making enemies all across the political spectrum. they will surely “win” this battle in hong kong, one way or another. but are they now stuck in a cold war that they might end up losing? could well be. as the above non-apology from these south park guys illustrates, to say nothing of events in hong kong, things are not now going entirely to their script. also, now that masks are no longer allowed in hong kong, how about a new hair-do?

this exact scenario was played out just before the weekend in the south pacific republic of vanuatu. vanuatu might be the answer to a quiz question, but though it has a population the size of hull it is also an independent sovereign country and a democracy. nevertheless, last week the chinese government sent officials to vanuatu and arrested five men and one woman, all of chinese ethnicity. that the republic’s government was complicit in these arrests makes the position more and not less worrying. before the chinese police arrived it is reported that the six had been held without charge for several days on the premises of a chinese company. though the chinese informed the government that their officers possessed chinese arrest warrants, neither the islanders nor anyone else has been told what the charges actually are. in spite of this, local police assisted with the accompanying of the detained individuals to the china-bound aircraft. almost incredibly the internal affairs minister of vanuatu has told the press that the reason why the six detainees did not appear before a vanuatu judge was that they were not charged with any crime in the territory. presumably if they had been then they would have had their day in court. as it is the minister has, in effect, connived at an abduction of his own citizens by a foreign power almost certainly in contravention of his country’s laws. the south china morning post report on the same story is quite bold to make an explicit link to the protests in hong kong against the proposed bill allowing extradition to mainland china, given that the newspaper has itself been subject to pressure from beijing. july 10th, 2019 | 28 comments - (comments are closed) why is russia trying to influence other countries’ elections by means of targeted advertising wrong? natalie solent (essex) · european union · international affairs · internet · media & journalism · russia · science & technology · uk affairs “nick clegg denies misuse of facebook influenced brexit vote”, reports the guardian. umm, okay. a lot of people are saying “well, he would say that, wouldn’t he?”. sir nick clegg, for those readers who have forgotten this rather forgettable chap, used to be leader of the liberal democrats and was deputy prime minister for a while, back when the lib dems were in coalition with the conservatives. he lost his seat in the 2017 election, which made him sad. then he got a “communications” job with facebook at a salary that probably made him feel better. so nine years after cleggmania, here he is back on our tv screens again. the times report on the same story says, the former liberal democrat leader said that social media could not be blamed for the vote to leave the european union. he said: “much though i understand why people want to reduce that eruption in british politics to some kind of plot or conspiracy — or some use of new social media through opaque means — i’m afraid the roots to british euroscepticism go very, very deep.” sir nick added: “yes, facebook has a heavy responsibility to protect the integrity of elections from outside interference. i also think we have a duty to explain fact from some of the allegations that have been made.” calling for greater regulation of the internet, he said: “we forget that though these companies are huge and affect every aspect of our lives — our social lives, our business lives — nonetheless it has all happened in such a short period of time. it is no surprise to find nick clegg “calling for “greater regulation of the internet”. not only was more regulation of corporations his schtick when he was a politico, it also suits his current employers very well. facebook can buy another twenty floors of lawyers whenever it needs them; struggling new startups cannot. but to hear such a lifelong europhile admit that the roots of british euroscepticism go deep was a surprise. he is right. russia’s puny efforts to interfere in the eu referendum were the equivalent of the eternally slandered king canute calling the tide forward. but in all this debate about how effective or ineffective russia’s “outside interference” in the referendum was i have not yet heard a convincing explanation of what exactly is wrong with “outside interference” anyway. i need not list the real crimes – waging unjust wars, murders, domestic repression – that can be laid at putin’s door. on an infinitely smaller scale, making use of harvested data that people did not agree to make available is a bad if commonplace thing. but what is bad in principle about russia trying to persuade british people to vote a particular way by advertising? where did this idea come from that only british ideas are allowed to enter british brains during an election or referendum campaign? in a democracy you are allowed to vote on any criteria you like. you can vote for a candidate because you carefully researched his or her voting record and found that it best aligned with your political beliefs, or because your family has always voted for the reds or the blues, or because you think the candidate has nice eyes, or because your imam told you which way to vote, or because vladimir putin did. they all count equally. if we were to operate a system of juche when it comes to political thought, would that not also exclude political ideas originating in the european union?
