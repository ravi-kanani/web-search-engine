her relationship with her mother broke down after she had a child outside of marriage, refused to marry the father and gave her child the pankhurst surname. in addition, she was also passionate in her anti-fascist and anti-colonialist campaigns, spending much of her life in ethiopia, where she eventually died in 1960. olive morris born in jamaica in 1952, olive morris became a notable political activist in the second half of the 20thcentury, focusing on race, feminism and the squatter’s rights movement. in the 1970s, she became a member of the british black panther group and was later a founding member of the brixton black women’s group. after moving to manchester to study at university, morris became involved in the manchester black women’s cooperative and campaigned for the abolition of fees for overseas students. morris died in 1979, aged just 27. diane abbott diane abbott was first elected as mp for hackney north and stoke newington in 1987. this made her the first black female mp, entering the house of commons during the thatcher years, at a time when new right philosophies prevailed. abbott has committed all of her political career to fighting for left-wing ideals, especially human rights and was first appointed to the shadow cabinet in 2010. in october 2016, abbott became the shadow home secretary, making her the first black woman to hold this office. abbott has notably faced considerable hatred and criticism, receiving 45% of hate directed at mps on twitter during the 2017 election. however, she has refused to let trolling silence her and remains a prominent voice in the labour party and parliament, only recently announcing her intention to step down from frontline politics. the feature image shows the women’s march in los angeles, usa. several women holding signs and placards can be seen. one in the foreground reads, ‘ok ladies, now let’s get in formation’. another sign reads ‘”each time a woman stands up for herself…she stands up for all women”-maya angelou’. the woman carrying this sign is wearing small, circular sunglasses and looks directly into the camera. photograph attribution: luke harold, used under the creative commons license the first photograph is a portrait of annie besant. she wears a white dress and has her fair hair scraped back. she is wearing a string of dark beads around her neck and stares directly into the camera. photograph in the public domain the next photograph is of a newspaper. the page shows sophia duleep singh, selling copies of the suffragette newspaper ‘the suffragette’. the headline of the paper reads ‘revolution’. duleep singh is wearing a dark coat and dark hat and the photograph is sepia. the caption of the photograph reads ‘princess sophia duleep singh selling “the suffragette” outside hampton court palace, where she has a suite of apartments’. photograph in the public domain the third photograph is a close-up of annie kenny. it is in black and white. she wears a dark hat, with a dark coat and looks off to the side. photograph credit: the national archives the next photograph is a black and white portrait of sylvia pankhurst. she has her hands clasped in front of her and rests her chin on her arm. she is wearing a white shawl, on top of a black dress and looks off to the side. photograph in the public domain the final image is of diane abbott mp and it is her official parliamentary photograph. her black hair is in a bob and she wears black, square-framed glasses. ms abbott is wearing a grey jacket on top of a blue dress and a chunky necklace of white flowers. she smiles and looks directly into the camera. photograph credit: chris mcandrew, used under the creative commons license unfortunately we were unable to source a free-to-use image of olive morris. however for more information, visit: https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/blog/black-history-month-power-olive-morris historyinternational women's day 2020intersectional feminismwomen's history month 2020 ciara garcha politics editor ciara is from manchester and is passionate about all things politics and history! she loves books, writing and is a huge manchester united fan. she is interested in pretty much anything relating to feminism and political history related posts ‘shoulder-gate’ reminds us that despite advances in representation, double standards in politics are as pervasive as ever ciara garcha12 february 2020 sturgeon and swinson: a tale of two elections ciara garcha7 january 2020 leave a reply cancel reply you must be logged in to post a comment. compilation ©2001-2018 the f-word. all rights reserved. | built by agilityweb
