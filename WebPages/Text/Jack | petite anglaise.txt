petite anglaise november 14, 2009 jack filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 10:13 pm jack was finally born at 41 weeks and 4 days on monday 2 november, on the night of the full moon. his birth was spookily similar to tadpole’s. i found myself in the same salle d’accouchement at the maternité des lilas where my daughter had been born six years earlier and, like his big sister, jack wasn’t all that keen on coming out. as a result, my hoped-for natural birth was soon forgotten as i had to be hooked up to various drips, given an epidural and strapped to a monitor. finally, at 7.03 pm, just as the midwife was paging the obstetrician and threatening me with forceps, i saw a head of dark hair emerging and the marathon was finally over (contractions had begun a full 24 hours earlier). i sobbed with relief afterwards and swore i would never go through it all again. eleven days later we are all well, blissfully happy and revelling in the boy’s paternity leave. jack would happily eat all day long, but he compensates by sleeping 4 or 5 hours in a row, twice a night. he pulls the most ridiculous faces when he’s trying to poo. the softest place in the whole world is the portion of his neck just below his little ears. i’m besotted with him, in short. we all are. tadpole wasn’t able to visit us at the hospital (h1n1 has a lot to answer for), but instantly fell in love with her little brother when i brought him home. ‘mummy,’ she said to me after her first cuddle with baby brother, ‘felicitations for making such a perfect baby.’ share this: twitter facebook related comments (144) 144 comments really happy for you!!! baby is absolutely gorgeous, wishing all of you every happiness together. tadpole is the perfect big sister! :) comment by happyforyou — november 14, 2009 @ 10:23 pm how delicious is jack?! he’s delightful. congratulations to you and the boy and tadpole, and welcome to the world, jack. i am delurking after years – just happened to check in to see if there was any news – but very glad i did. catherine, you and heather over at dooce have succeeded in making me very sentimental for those first, new-baby weeks. as you know, they are very special, and fleeting. i do hope that you are all settling in well together -best wishes to you all. comment by rosehippy — november 14, 2009 @ 10:23 pm he is absolutely gorgeous! i’m sad now though as i suspect this is probably the last time you will ever post! i wish you and your beautiful family good health and every form of happiness. thank you for the years of pleasurable reading. comment by ellie — november 14, 2009 @ 10:32 pm felicitations indeed. he’s beautiful. congratulations! comment by sprite — november 14, 2009 @ 10:47 pm tadpole always seems to know exactly what to say. ditto. comment by the bold soul — november 14, 2009 @ 10:51 pm congratulations! and thank you for taking time from your busy days to let us know. comment by materfamilias — november 14, 2009 @ 10:53 pm congratulations to all of you – and welcome to the world, jack! he’s lovely! comment by pinklea — november 14, 2009 @ 11:22 pm felicitations for your perfect baby indeed!!! twinkle twinkle happiness… comment by beyond — november 14, 2009 @ 11:28 pm he is so lovely! now i want a new baby to snuggle… comment by http://designermama-manaallamano.blogspot.com/ — november 15, 2009 @ 12:03 am congrats, petite. comment by brennig — november 15, 2009 @ 12:29 am félicitations ! i can’t say it any better than tadpole. i just showed my 2-year-old the pictures of jack, and he’s saying “see jack again.” comment by might i add...?

jack is so cute and am so happy for you… my best wishes comment by girl across the ocean — november 19, 2009 @ 1:21 pm *beaming* i am so over-the-moon for you! many congratulations. welcome, jack! some words from the great kurt vonnegut to you, “there’s only one rule that i know of, babies—god damn it, you’ve got to be kind.” (cited here: 15 things kv said better than anyone) i am an 11th hour reader of the blog (as in, i started reading after you decided to stop posting, *snort*), but one who lurked almost all the back posts, ran out to contribute to your children’s university fund with the purchase of the memoir, and have enjoyed reading it all very thoroughly. :) i also just live down the hill from belleville and because of the blog & book have been out to enjoy the ‘hood a lot more. yesterday, a new friend of mine and i went out to check out the parc de belleville for the first time (i have lived here almost a year and a half and did not know it was there, lol, but discovered it because you wrote about it) and we were duly impressed with the view. you have helped me adjust to living here, helped me to get out and about to see and do some things as you have written about them; in short, you have helped me have a life, and this is a tremendous thing for one human being to give to another. so thanks. i think jack has a great mom, a great sister, and i am sure a wonderful father, but i did not read the parts about him so much yet, lol. i will get there. i am sure if he is with you, making this beautiful family, he is the cat’s meow. :d live long and prosper! comment by karin (an alien parisienne) — november 19, 2009 @ 2:38 pm i said it on twitter and i will keep saying it: i’m so happy for you! congratulations!!! wishing all of you all the best… :) comment by *martha* — november 20, 2009 @ 11:44 am congratulations – what wonderful news!

jeanne comment by jeanne — november 28, 2009 @ 2:36 am felicitations on your beautiful baby boy! it feels very bizarre reading your blog and writing a comment!! i am a french teacher and my pupils bought me petite anglaise as a present for taking them on a school trip to paris. your book has now been passed around our whole department and we’ve all loved it. it brought back so many memories of our ‘year abroad’ from uni and we’ve been reminiscing in the mfl office at every opportunity. i’m going to order french kissing as a christmas present for my colleagues (and myself of course!) merci petite, after reading your book i feel like i’ve also fallen back in love with france!

it was a wonderful read, and i so look forward to seeing your name on many more covers in the years to come. writing from sunny florida to wish you and your family the best… aly comment by aly — december 14, 2009 @ 4:39 am 4-5 hours, twice a day? that’s fantastic — long may it continue! love your turkey pictures by the way. think we stayed in more or less the same istanbul hotel at october half-term. what a city ! comment by roads — december 15, 2009 @ 9:13 pm congrats petite!! jack shares my birthday and what a wonderful day it is. i’m not certain it holds the same significance in europe but in mexico, nov 2nd is celebrated as the day of the dead and in canada, i grew up knowing my day as all souls day. not macabre in the least, for me, but instead a day where life is celebrated and souls remembered. i wish jack all the luck i have had as a scorpio. not as fancy as christmas or st. patrick’s day but special all the same. comment by jen — december 17, 2009 @ 3:37 am well done darling xxx and babies first christmas coming up as well. my new years resolution… to read your new book xxx comment by missy — december 18, 2009 @ 11:25 pm that’s the cutest baby ever :) congratulations comment by angie — december 30, 2009 @ 6:30 pm what a gorgeous little man, congratulations. comment by part mummy part me — january 2, 2010 @ 12:50 am congrats, petite. happy 2010 to you and your lovely family. comment by unbalanced reaction — january 2, 2010 @ 3:14 am we also have a son, jack, who gives us a run for our money. best of luck!!!

comment by henri bik — january 21, 2010 @ 8:25 pm congratulations and well done. take care of yourself and your family. comment by lionel johnson — january 26, 2010 @ 9:27 am congratulations on the addition to your family. i often read your blog, but never comment. naughty i know. i am stupid! why? after reading and enjoying your first book i ordered a copy of what i thought was your new book, “french kisses”, and when i opened it and started reading without looking at the authors name i thought “this can’t be right” it was then i saw that is was by ‘george east’. doh! comment by keith — february 2, 2010 @ 12:03 pm hi catherine we havn`t spoken since the victoria derbyshire show on five live but i really have to congratulate you on the birth of another angel. chapters close, new ones open – your life really has turned full circle throughout the petite years, probably even better than you ever imagined, live the dream-you deserve it! comment by david — february 4, 2010 @ 2:25 pm lunch today at the café charbon was excellent, thanks to you! i sat next to your special table as i prefer the window; what a pleasure it was to eat there, added greatly by the delight i have had in reading your charming book.i got to page 150 and decided i’ll have to buy this for my daughter, also a francophile, and for many friends. i’m certain this would translate well into french, although i’m sure you must have considered this. how lucky i am to live in paris in the 11e! no, i could never go back to live in the uk. i was delighted to learn of jack and his safe arrival. my very best wishes to all four of you, plus of course, mr frog. have a very happy life. comment by méricourt — february 5, 2010 @ 5:54 pm hi.. this is ravi padiyar… just wanted to give my heartiest congratulations :-) comment by ravi padiyar — february 9, 2010 @ 6:31 pm he’s precious. congratulations!

having taken the mfl degree route myself and done the year abroad, i say fair play to you for making it happen by staying there xxx comment by ella — april 5, 2010 @ 1:09 pm many many congratulations – my first baby was 41 weeks five days and just under 5kgs – he was in no particular hurry to come out – no doubt enjoying the 15,000 calories a day i was feeding him… beautiful baby. bravo ! xx comment by belgravia wife - sort of — april 18, 2010 @ 5:00 am hi petite–i know you aren’t blogging anymore, but i would love to see new photos of jack!! comment by kathryn — april 21, 2010 @ 11:59 pm i just finished reading your book and i can’t tell you just how much i enjoyed it and felt such a deep personal attachment to it. i was born in paris of american parents, both writers, who met in budapest in 1948 and who later married had three of us in paris, the last one born in london and then we were off to live in ethiopia followed by chile. i was taught french first as the expectation was that i would also learn english, having american parents and one day would end up in the united states. and so it went. i now live in the us but starting with paris and france as a whole is a place i hope to someday be able to actually live in and experience more than for a few days or week at a time. barring no more volcanic ash interruptions, i am off to france next week for a holiday with my mr. frog and couldn’t have timed reading your book any better. not until today did i know what was new in your life but am thrilled to see you just brought a new life into this world, jack is adorable, not to mention how nice for tadpole that she now has a sister. i must take time to go on facebook to find out when mr. boy came into the picture, how tadpole is doing and what is new in mr. frog’s life. i look forward to reading your new book too. there are very few times where the reader brings you into their lives and you feel you know them, you connect, you feel their emotions, you know what places they are talking about and you share their outlook, their passions and their wonderful joie de vivre. thank you for your wonderful story telling, your sincerity and your unique, honest way of sharing your life, your thoughts, and your love for paris and tadpole and now jack. a bientot, deborah comment by deborah — april 22, 2010 @ 1:49 am that’s funny, my new son was born on 13th (friday) of november, not long after your therefore. it’s funny to see you ‘blogging-off’, as it were, as my own blogging activity gets ever more intense. but you are right. absolutely right, and i wish you well as you continue on your life’s journey, blogless or otherwise. it’s so easy to get our priorities wrong. or maybe just to not realise when things have naturally come to a logical conclusion. right now blogging is suiting me fine, but as you say, with facebook, and me too getting more into twitter, things will change. as they must. comment by sab — april 22, 2010 @ 3:13 am bonjour, maman de 2 jeunes enfants en congé parental je me dis ce soir que ça fait très longtemps que je n’ai pas fait un tour sur le site de petite anglaise…et que vois-je? un livre sorti en août et un bébé né en novembre…félicitations!!!que le temps passe…j’ai du rattrapage à faire ;-) comment by helene — april 29, 2010 @ 9:00 pm congratulations! it is very nice to see pictures! best wishes to your family! comment by andrew — april 30, 2010 @ 8:25 pm first of all concratulations for having this lovely child! i’m from finland (i apologize my bad english) and i just finished your book, petite anglaise. i’m glad i bumped into it in the library, cause it made me so happy and i was so attahced to it. i have an fascination with france too and your book made me believe that moving there could be possible for me too if i just wanted it enough. your thoughts were similiar to mine and made me think about my relationship in a new way. my words aren’t enough to tell how much the book gave to me. after reading the book i had to came to see if you are still writing your blog. feels unbelievable to actually see the real you and tadpole and see what’s happening to you today because before visiting this website you all were just characters in your book. it’s funny to see here what happend after the book, cause the end was so open. usually you don’t get that opportunity when the story ends :d i’m little sad you are going to stop writing cause i just found your blog, but i wish the best of luck for all of you in the future. p.s. inspired by you i got the courage to create my own blog :) comment by lillepyy — may 26, 2010 @ 5:44 pm warmest congratulations. and what a pleasant surprise to have suddenly ten post pop up in google reader after such along hiatus. my daughter and i wish you wonderful times now that you are four! comment by malcolm james thomson — june 28, 2010 @ 12:06 pm hi there actually this probably happened because i’ve been moving my blog over to wordpress.com and so the feed must have been re-set as a result. this post was my last and was dated november 2009, i’m afraid! i want to leave the blog online for posterity, but hosting was expensive and so i’m going to try this service on for size instead… comment by petiteanglaise — june 28, 2010 @ 12:31 pm chere petite, well, i just wrote a rather long comment and seem to have lost it – so much for my first attempt at responding to a blog! really, i am long-winded, so the shorter version is probably preferable and, yes, this is the short version :-) i just wanted to say merci mille fois, thanks a million, from an adoring reader, grande indeed pour une femme at almost 180 cm, half frog myself, although of the canadian variety, who just discovered you recently while on a trip to maui which, in more ways than one, ended up being a very life changing time in my life. i have lived through the very painful ending of a 7-year relationship to a man that i so wanted to spend forever with, so of course i found myslef in your story, and it is still somewhat impossible to imagine life going on after such an ending, but going on it is, and new beginnings emerge, somehow, out of the ashes, as they say. reading petite, and all the comments from other readers and writers, has been tremendously inspiring and comforting to me, and i am so thankful to everyone for all the shared words, stories, and positive emotions which feel as though they are surrounding me with hope and faith in the possibilities of new life to come, just as is shown in the picture of your dear jack. i do also want to acknowledge here and send best wishes today to my one and only male housemate at the current time, norman birdie bates, my handsome blue budgie whose sweet singing has been keeping me company of late and whose chirpy character and humorous antics never fail to raise my spirits; i apopted him three years ago on july 7, a date which i believe is especially lucky and important because, if i read correctly, it was when petite anglaise sprang to life, and a long life to come it has indeed, with new friends finding you, or perhaps it is you finding us, every day – félicitations et bonne anniversaire! comment by grande canadienne — july 8, 2010 @ 8:43 am congratulations! tadpole has a most endearing way with words! comment by maris — july 12, 2010 @ 9:35 pm just finished reading your book and really enjoyed it. this is my first time reading your blog so it’s great being able to find out what happened next, although there are a few gaps i need to fill in. congratulations on your beautiful baby. really happy that everything seems to be working out great for you. comment by missusme — august 8, 2010 @ 1:47 pm i can feel your happiness through the write up. this is a divine feeling and probably the best thing that can ever happen to a woman. cheers!! comment by mellisa lane — august 18, 2010 @ 1:08 am hiiiii how cute child. congratulations! comment by jitu | news uncle — august 18, 2010 @ 9:00 am hi, jack seems to be a pretty nice kid :) take care and please start posting on this blog again. i am really looking forward to reading more from you. thanks. cheers :) comment by web design manchester — august 18, 2010 @ 3:25 pm congratulations!
