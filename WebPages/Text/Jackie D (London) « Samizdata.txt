(you can get the t-shirt from threadless.) february 25th, 2009 | 6 comments - (comments are closed) the polite manner of “counter-terrorism” in the uk jackie d (london) · civil liberty & regulation · uk affairs i could not help but be struck by the nice, polite, and almost friendly manner of the police officer making violence-backed threats in the video below (“if you refuse this [random] search, you will be arrested.”). it may not be news to you that the face of the police state is often a perfectly pleasant one, but i think it is worth spreading the word. (full disclosure: i work for qik, and it was one of our users who live streamed the above video from his mobile phone to the web using our software.) august 19th, 2008 | 34 comments - (comments are closed) samizdata quote of the day jackie d (london) · privacy & panopticon · slogans & quotations you should trust us, because we’re trustworthy people who would never do anything wrong (please ignore all we’ve done wrong over the past few years). so, now that that’s settled, let’s get this baby rolling… -mike masnick interprets department of homeland security head michael chertoff’s response to critics of the planned expansion of the us spy satellite program april 15th, 2008 | comments are closed working for the bbc jackie d (london) · uk affairs cartoonist and commentator hugh macleod says it all about the organization with “an assured income of £3.5 billion a year” of forced funding: september 12th, 2007 | 16 comments - (comments are closed) those predictable unions jackie d (london) · north american affairs i have no problem with unions existing; freedom of association is an important right and one that should never be taken away from us. the problem i have is with unions always seeming to be on the wrong side of every damn issue. and so it goes with patent reform. way not to break precedent, guys. august 27th, 2007 | 13 comments - (comments are closed) from paxman’s mouth to god’s ears jackie d (london) · arts & entertainment · uk affairs it is all too easy to imagine a future in which our grandchildren will talk of having had an ancestor who worked for the bbc in the same way as people nowadays mention having had a grandparent or great-grandparent who worked for the sudanese political service, or was a district officer in bechuanaland. –jeremy paxman, keeping hope alive for millions of britons august 24th, 2007 | 7 comments - (comments are closed) samizdata hq is still seeing action jackie d (london) · antics & parties in case you are worried that all has been quiet on the party front, i am here to reassure you. the sad fact is that some of these parties require so much in the way of recovery – in the form of sunday brunches, vast quantities of water, and time spent lying in a darkened room – that it can take a while to get to reporting on them. such was the case on a recent weekend, when our most fierce and lovely editor, miss adriana, celebrated her birthday with a few of her favorite ‘freedom fighters’. elena demonstrated the proper form for bum handling on an invisible model, despite no shortage of live volunteers perry always believed that two tarts were better than one while nick held the other blokes rapt with his best collectivist joke, hugh googled furiously to find out the punchline you do not want to know what elena spotted crawling out of my nose the birthday girl let her t-shirt – and the plentiful booze – do the talking oh, you know those samizdata parties: it is always hard to tell who you will end up sleeping with at the end of the night more photos are here. august 21st, 2007 | 7 comments - (comments are closed) which starlet is in bigger trouble? jackie d (london) · arts & entertainment no, i am not talking about the tiresome lindsay lohan and her ilk. perusing the morning papers, i could not help but wonder who will come under more fire: kiera knightley for glamorizing smoking (and looking absolutely stunning while she does so), or sienna miller for wearing what appears to be a keffiyeh as a bikini top? august 20th, 2007 | 7 comments - (comments are closed) pull the other one, giuliani jackie d (london) · north american affairs leave my family alone, just like i’ll leave your family alone. seriously, can we get this promise in writing? then again, i am pretty familiar with what politicians consider “leaving [us] alone”. it is akin to saying, “well, i am still going to bugger you senseless, and i am still going to do it without your consent, but from now on i will not force you to grab your ankles and beg for more.” august 17th, 2007 | 19 comments - (comments are closed) get around the smoking ban in london jackie d (london) · uk affairs all you have to do is take up cigars! july 5th, 2007 | 8 comments - (comments are closed) “myspace invaders” take their cue from the law jackie d (london) · uk affairs considering how good squatters have it in england and wales, i find it hard to take the faux-incredulousness in the british press about people who organize themselves on myspace before going into unoccupied homes and destroying them for the fun of it. the law of the land has such little regard for property rights that it should come as a shock to no one that these teenagers do not, either. april 17th, 2007 | 5 comments - (comments are closed) older entries » who are we?
