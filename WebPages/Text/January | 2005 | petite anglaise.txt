petite anglaise january 31, 2005 a new toy (from hell) filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 11:53 am the rational part of my brain was berating me for letting a a seemingly insignificant thing overwhelm me. the rest of me was a quivering mass of panic, panic, panic, pulse racing, adrenaline flowing, feeling utterly, terrifyingly helpless. the weekend began with the purchase of a new computer. something that had been planned for a while, as my trusty companion since 2000 was not even compatible with xp. or ipods. and was starting to labour a bit if i tried to use anything remotely interesting like dreamweaver or photoshop. and so it came to pass that i added a a powerful but not too expensive new toy to my shopping basket and frog, tadpole and i went to collect it from surcouf in a borrowed car this weekend. surcouf is a computer warehouse shop, located in the seventh circle of hell. vast, intimidating and filled with swarms of teenage boys with skin problems at the weekends. the salespeople are young, incompetent and – apologies for the generalisation – mostly de la caillera (backslang for racaille: literal meaning = scum; commonly used to describe young folk from the dodgier suburbs, who may or may not be dressed like british ‘chavs’). i marched straight to the collection room brandishing my internet receipt and queued up in front of a large printed sign which read ‘desktops’. charming young gentleman at the desk, growling: ‘c’est là -bas, vous savez pas lire ou quoi?’ (‘the queue is over there, can’t you read?’) ah yes, a handwritten post it note attached to the ‘laptops’ sign did indeed read ‘internet orders’. cheeks flaming i fled. french customer service: an exercise in humiliation. home sweet home and several hours of saving things from the old computer later, i emerged from a spaghetti of computer wiring, covered in the clumps of fluffy dust you only find behind electrical appliances (rather appropriately called ‘moutons’ in french). and switched it on. it sounded like a hairdryer. i began to wish i hadn’t made quite such an impulsive purchase. i dimly recall having read somewhere once that amd processors can overheat and tend to need very strong fans to keep them cool. perhaps the fact that the computer was called aspiro should have sent alarm bells ringing. not aspiro as in aspirational or something nice and positive. aspiro as in ‘aspirateur’ (french: hoover, vaccuum cleaner). the smiling lady pictured on the box was probably wearing cunningly concealed earplugs. gritting my teeth, determined to pretend that it didn’t sound like i was sitting in front of a jumbo jet propellor, i loaded up the antivirus, spyware destroyer and firewall first, like the sensible girl i am. i noted, with annoyance, that xp was in french. a lovely language, but one which has no business to be on my operating system. another point i had gaily overlooked while making my purchase. i then spent the rest of the day duelling with a particularly resistant browser hijacker. i removed it, it came back. repeat to fade. each time the red spyware alert popped up to say that the little f*$@&r was trying to re-install itself, i edged one step closer to meltdown. a cool, white, padded cell started to look soothing and attractive. and forgive me for sharing what could be seen as too much information, but i note that the laxative properties of viruses and spyware are really quite remarkable. i think it’s gone now. fingers crossed. but i have to admit i am dreading going home and switching on the hairdryer from hell just in case that pop up message comes back again. i simply can’t face wiping clean a brand new computer and reinstalling everything. i had nightmares about it last night. i’m an untidy bundle of nerves. how is it that these machines are able to wield such power over us? and why didn’t i shack up with a geekfrog who could sort these things out. why oh why? comments (26) vote! filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:48 am well, it would seem that i won’t be needing those pyjamas after all… voting ends today! i need your help! 20 votes behind carniola at the last count! comments (14) january 28, 2005 party time! filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 11:31 am how very inconsiderate of my boss to give me stacks of work to do. i’ve got a responsibility to my visitors to come up with a new post this morning. really, it’s not on. in the meantime, my virtual self is over at rachie’s place at a party, and we need males. in fancy dress. or a state of undress. we’re not fussy. (well, i’m not anyway). see you there? comments off on party time! january 26, 2005 driving in paris: a survival guide filed under: city of light — petiteanglaiseparis @ 12:45 pm i passed my driving test on the third attempt. even then, i’m not convinced this was in the best interests of the residents of york. the summer before going away to university when my mother foolishly insured me to drive her car, i managed to reverse into a tesco trolley park and hit the brick gatepost in our driveway. my father spent most of that summer removing the bumper, hammering it back into shape and putting it back on again. in my defence, the trolley park in question was empty and in the blind spot in the rear window. this was in the days when car seats were not height adjustable. i remember vividly the day my long-suffering driving instructor told me to line up the curb with a sticker on the rear window when reversing around the corner. i had to break the news to him that i couldn’t even see the curb. i’m not called petite for nothing. that was in 1991. i haven’t driven since. to complicate matters i am now living in a country where people drive on the wrong side of the road and change gear with their right hands. after a decade i still cannot get my head around this, so whether i’m in france or the uk i invariably head to the wrong side of every car when trying to locate the passenger seat. and whether i’m crossing a french road or an english road i inevitably look the wrong way first. to make matters worse, i live in a city where most people drive as if they have just snorted several grams of cocaine (arrogantly, aggressively), parallel park in miniscule spaces (ahem, parallel parking wasn’t even tested back in 1991) and disregard a different highway code altogether. you will be relieved to hear that i don’t plan to exchange my british driving license for a french one any time soon. if you are foolhardy enough to drive in the french capital, here are a few tips on how to drive like a native parisian: you know those lovely big french roundabouts with no lane markings whatsoever – like charles de gaulle etoile, bastille and place de la concorde? the rule for use of these roundabouts is under no circumstances should you use your indicator to show people what your intentions are. instead, weave in and out of the ‘lanes’ in a random fashion, and then cut off several lanes of traffic when you reach your exit. learn to park the french way! nudging the bumpers of the cars adjacent to your space is perfectly acceptable, and indeed expected. i once spied four people lifting a fiat uno sideways out of a space it had got hemmed into. ignore traffic lights. give yourself an extra five seconds to drive across a junction after the lights have turned to red. everyone else does. or at the very least, brake at the very last minute so that paranoid, pushchair-wheeling pedestrians are unsure about whether you plan to stop, or not. that way they can only get to the traffic island in the middle before the lights change. if you drive a moped/scooter/motorbike it is compulsory to drive the wrong way around traffic islands in order to get ahead. it keeps pedestrians on their toes (except petite anglaise, who instinctively looks the wrong way and therefore cannot be caught out). driving across the pavement to jump the lights altogether is also perfectly acceptable, on one condition: do not reduce your speed. the horn should be used liberally at all times, and not just when you are part of a wedding cortège. rolling down your windows and swearing* is also highly recommended if you want to blend in with the natives. there doesn’t have to be any particular provocation. and don’t forget to accompany your tirade with a vigorous shake of your fist. cut out and keep swearing vocab in french: connard! – assehole! enculé! – asshole! fils de pute! – sonofabitch! you’re good to go. comments (28) older posts » search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com. post to cancel
