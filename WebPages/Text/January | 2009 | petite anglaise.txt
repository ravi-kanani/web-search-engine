petite anglaise january 26, 2009 tadpolecast – maya l’abeille filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:48 am i think of all the things i’ve posted on this blog, the tadpole sings category affords me the most retrospective amusement. listening to her ‘performance’ of twinkle twinkle little star, in french and english, aged two, makes me realise what a long way we’ve come (and just how long i’ve been blogging). playing the song she invented, aged four, about falling down and ripping open her top lip on a jagged manhole cover simultaneously brings tears to my eyes and makes me laugh out loud. i’m not one for taking a lot of photos, and almost never think to film anything, but i’ll definitely be hanging on to these audio clips for posterity. todays podcast features tadpole’s rendition of the theme tune to a cartoon which was enormously popular in france in the late 70’s and early 80’s, maya l’abeille (maya the bee). correct me if i’m wrong, but i don’t think maya ever aired in the uk, even if the austro-japanese production seems to have enjoyed success elsewhere around the world. so i have mr frog and his fondness for showing tadpole clips of favourite children’s programmes from his youth on youtube* to thank. https://petiteanglaise.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/maya.mp3 and the funny noises are, um, kisses. i believe there are three. tadpole was in an affectionate mood… *original version of the maya theme tune. extremely high pitched singing alert. play at your own risk. maya comments (51) january 6, 2009 words of wisdom filed under: tadpole rearing, tadpole says — petiteanglaiseparis @ 10:32 am tadpole and i hurry along the cobbled street, hand in hand, trying to avoid the patches of black ice that have formed overnight. an anxious glance at my watch reveals that it is 8.28, and i quicken my pace. tadpole is chattering nineteen to the dozen about the coming day at school. ‘we’re going to do a travail que j’adore,’ she says, making me rather nostalgic for a time when i could feel such simple, strong emotions (and also for a time when ‘work’ consisted of doing a spot of colouring in without straying over the lines). ‘the maîtresse has made some sheets with a 2009 on,’ tadpole continues, ‘and inside every number there’s the beginning of a pattern. and we have to take a different coloured pen for each number, and continue the pattern, and then at the bottom it’s written ‘bonne année!’ with a big point d’exclamation, and we have to copy it, to practise how to do writing on a line, and then…’ meanwhile, i am making a to-do list in my head. i need to edit at least three chapters before dinnertime. i must pop by the pharmacy to pick up my folic acid. it’s market day on boulevard de belleville, and i compile a mental shopping list (peppers, mushrooms, clementines, kiwi fruit (tadpole’s favourite), bananas and broccoli). i ought to try and finalise some tentative plans for our coming weekend in yorkshire, assuming the black ice and minus double figure temperatures expected in paris later this week don’t ground our plane and scupper our plans altogether. i need to fix the dodgy starter sparky thing on the gas hobs and get a battery for the torch so that if i manage to trip the fusebox again, like i did yesterday, i don’t end up running around in the dark looking for matches while tadpole attempts to eat her dinner in the dark, with predictably messy results. i need to give uk bank details to my agents, because if they take it into their heads to send any advance money over to me in france at the current exchange rate, i think i will cry. ‘mummy!’ shouts tadpole, her eyes flashing with anger. ‘you’re not list-en-ing to me, are you?’ ‘i am!’ i protest, untruthfully. ‘you were saying how much you were looking forward to working on your 2009 picture! it sounded great. i was listening and thinking at the same time.’ ‘no you weren’t,’ says tadpole firmly. ‘you only listened to the beginning. you’re not in-ter-est-ed mummy. you don’t really care about my 2009…’ i curse the day tadpole became so scarily perceptive. there’s no pulling the wool over her eyes any more. whereas i can still fool the boy – punctuating his lengthy, blow by blow accounts of poker games with a few strategic ‘mmm’s’ or the occasional ‘mouais‘ without him seeming any the wiser – tadpole has an uncanny talent for knowing precisely when and why my attention has strayed and pulls me up on it, every single time. and that’s not all. ‘when you say “mmm” it doesn’t mean “no” or “yes” or anything,’ she explained to me the other day. ‘it just means you’re not really listening. and when you say “we’ll see”, you really mean “no”.’ ‘and how about when i say we’ll do something later?’ i enquire, wondering if my arsenal is now completely empty. ‘well,’ says tadpole, furrowing her brow. ‘later is more difficult. it can means lots of things. sometimes it means “in a little while”. sometimes it means “the day after the next day”.’ she pauses, and for a moment i think i may just have got away with this one. ‘but usually,’ she adds sagely, ‘if you say we’ll do something later, you mean never.’ comments (89) search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
