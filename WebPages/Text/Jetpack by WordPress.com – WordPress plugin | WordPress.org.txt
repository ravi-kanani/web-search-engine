account? since jetpack and its services are provided and hosted by wordpress.com, a wordpress.com account is required for jetpack to function. i already have a wordpress account, but jetpack isn’t working. what’s going on? a wordpress.com account is different from the account you use to log into your self-hosted wordpress. if you can log into wordpress.com, then you already have a wordpress.com account. if you can’t, you can easily create one during installation. how do i view my stats? once you’ve installed jetpack your stats will be available on wordpress.com/stats, on the official wordpress mobile apps, and on your jetpack dashboard. how do i contribute to jetpack? there are opportunities for developers at all levels to contribute. learn more about contributing to jetpack or
