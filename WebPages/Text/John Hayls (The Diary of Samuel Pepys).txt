"probably the oldest of these, and certainly the least important, is hayls. he only comes alive to us in the pages of pepys's *diary,* and the portrait of 'pepys' in the national portrait gallery [london] is certainly a version of one he was painting in 1666." two portraits of the younger children of montague bertie, second earl of lindsey (charles and bridget), are attributed to him. they were painted around 1653. "[t]here is some likelihood, from a source in one of richard symonds's notebooks, that hayls was in rome in 1651. other early attributions to hayls remain puzzling." -- ellis waterhouse, "painting in britain 1530-1790," 4th edition, 1978, pp. 100-101 (the pelican history of art series) ✹ david ross mcirvine on 28 jan 2004 • link {not too high an opinion of hayls} pepys agrees with that estimation of hales's relative merits as a painter, in the diary entry of march 25, 1667: "called at mr. lilly's, who was working; and indeed his pictures are without doubt much beyond mr. hales's. . . ."
