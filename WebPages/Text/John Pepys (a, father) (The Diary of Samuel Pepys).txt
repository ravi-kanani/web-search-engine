july 1664. heath noted that the handwriting and punctuation were so erratic that it was hard to know where a sentence ended. printed below as it appeared in her book (pages 10-13): dear soon you will find by the inclosed that the foule mouthed docter is resolved to be troublesom it was with the consent of his brother mr roger for thay ware both with mr fillips [the lawyer at brampton] that brought me this letter. thay gote a promise from him to be for them befor thay told him aganst home it was. and sent the note to him after ward and docter tomess note that he had under your brother hand for £ 10 but noe seal to it. he did acknowleg to me and your brother john that it was but £ 8 pound that was due to him and thare was 19s and 6d was in your brothers book which was due to him of that £ 8. i was with mr fillips this morning & he shoed me the note for the 10 pound. and i see noe seal to it & i told him thare shuld be noe need of troubling a baly to serve the leet. tharefore pray good child let thare be som theng done in it. nether can i know how an new inventery can be mad the goods is so disparsed. if you have aded the mony which is 24s for the 3 shirtes and 40s for the clothe. and a letter case. i can but tak my oath-as i have done all redy- that i have mad a true inventery of all things that was his i hope you have receved my last letter with the [receipt] inclosed under toms hand [see note 1] for an acknowlegment that the goods were mine with the other paper which was writ not a quarter of a year before he died whare in he wished i wold mak and asinement of my goods over to him. now in answer to your last i have spoken to will stancks and he will sift out steven wilson and foxe [see note 2] what was due when your uncle died he is afeared that foxe hath payd your uncle. i wished w. stancks to let him know if he pleeds, that he had noe write to it tell he was admited to it. and for ashtone [ see note 3] stanckes cannot tell what it shuld be for that thare shuld be mony due from him for the close. thar was an acker that belonged to an other man that your uncle never agreed for but thinking he might have it at any time yelded to pay 8s a year tell he had concluded for it. and soe your uncle set trees and dichet and set a queck set as far as that acker went. he that ode [owned] it being dead it is latin [letten] to an nother and he hath taken it to his one use. it was the land that the hay cock stood one. stanckes gote the gate removed when i was at london last. so prices mony is not to be payd tell mickellmus or the next cort that we give up our write to him in the land. for the £ 39 pound which is yet due to us from piget doe not know what securi[ty] we are like to have from him for it more then we have all redy. we must indever to mak sale of soe much as is left for soe much as is left unpayd. i doe not yet understand hoe it is that is to give sattisfackshon for the none payment of [rent] from the time that it shuld be payd. as for barten bisnes thare is 7 rodes of that land your uncle had of old barten [see note 4] which is worth a matter of 15 or 16£ to be sold. thes and soe much more as mad it up 14 or 16£ a yeare was geven to old barten and his wife and to the are male of them to after thare desest. this was geven 4 years befor the oner died. when he died he gave all the rest of his estate to old barten. if we cannot find any writing that bartan was ingaged to your uncle for to cleare this. if we cold find any thing then we cold tak a corse with the old man. if we cannot if the old man die it comes to the young man and we cannot hinder him. mr narborow hath a good bart of this land and hath sold it to price and price hath the bennefet of it this year. it is thought he refueses to paye mr narborow tell he hath cleared this thing. i desird he wold act for us as wel as himself and according to the valluashan of ours we wold contribute toward the charges. you will doe very well to write to him and at your uncle whiles you may know how to have your ietter convade. not receveing a letter by york makes me fear thare is som hinderance of my daughters [elizabeth] coming next week. if thare be i shall be very sory for it for i shold be very glad to see her hear as sone as can be. dear child i am very much troubled what my lords potiecarries [see note 5] fear is of you-that you have an ulser groeing in your kidnes. for godsak let me beg of you that you will have mr holards' advice and som able docter of his acquantance with as much speed as you can. and to beg a blesing from the lord that your life may be preserved for what a sad condishan shuld your poor old father and mother be in if the lord shuld tak you before us. i shall be very glad if any lines com to will stanck to day for our bisnes requires his spedie asistance. thiss with mine and your mothers very kindely be presented to you both with your sisters service i rest hoe shall ever be your very loving father john pepys note 1: the inventory of the tailor shop and the later part is tom's endorsement of it http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2007/03/31/inve… dated august 25, 1661. note 2: heath explains that fox and perhaps wilson also had purchased land previously from uncle robert. note 3: ashton does not appear as either person or place in the diary. note 4: heath explains john barton was married to elizabeth kight (sister of margaret, therefore sam's uncle via marriage) and "was an alderman and burgess of huntingdon and apparently an intimate of sandwich. from the diary it is apparent that barton's business refers to the sale of a house which uncle robert had bought of barton, but to which barton's title had been dubious, as appeared when one prior offered to buy the place from john pepys senior." (p 12) note 5: "apothocary" refers to dr. burnett, see his advice to sam http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/07/01/ ✹ terry foreman on 9 jun 2015 • link another tailor, william langford, occupied pepys's old home in salisbury court, made vacant by tom pepys's death. langford was a sub-tenant of pepys's father, and after the house was destroyed in the fire made a new lease with the landlord, edward franke: http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1668/12/23/ log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 jan 1 5 6 8 11 22 24 25 26 29 feb 5 6 8 12 13 15 19 22 25 26 27 mar 3 7 8 10 11 13 16 20 21 may 8 jun 6 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 24 26 jul 8 15 18 19 20 22 29 30 aug 12 13 14 18 22 24 29 sep 3 12 15 23 24 oct 1 2 7 8 14 15 18 21 26 nov 4 7 9 11 12 16 20 25 26 27 dec 5 9 12 16 21 29 30 1661 jan 1 3 4 7 9 18 28 31 feb 2 4 11 12 22 23 27 mar 1 9 11 13 25 26 31 apr 1 2 6 7 14 15 16 19 21 23 24 28 29 may 6 8 11 12 19 21 31 jun 3 4 14 15 21 23 24 25 26 27 30 jul 2 4 6 7 13 14 15 19 20 23 25 27 29 30 aug 5 6 7 9 10 11 13 16 18 19 21 22 23 25 26 27 29 31 sep 3 5 16 18 19 20 21 22 23 oct 12 14 31 nov 7 dec 7 31 1662 jan 8 11 18 feb 1 8 21 22 25 mar 8 18 may 19 21 27 28 31 jun 2 3 5 6 7 11 jul 4 aug 2 sep 10 12 16 20 27 28 30 oct 3 11 13 14 29 nov 18 24 29 dec 5 31 1663 jan 6 8 11 16 21 feb 7 mar 12 28 31 apr 1 2 3 4 7 8 9 11 14 15 16 17 19 20 22 23 24 25 26 29 30 may 1 3 4 8 12 17 19 30 jun 5 11 27 30 jul 1 2 16 21 aug 4 6 10 12 14 16 18 sep 1 3 13 15 16 17 19 20 24 30 oct 10 26 31 nov 6 30 dec 10 31 1664 feb 7 10 13 18 21 27 mar 3 4 14 15 17 18 19 20 21 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 31 apr 3 6 9 11 12 13 14 16 27 30 may 4 5 13 15 16 17 20 24 25 26 27 31 jun 4 6 20 26 29 jul 10 28 aug 7 17 22 25 31 sep 2 4 5 6 9 12 18 28 oct 14 15 dec 14 15 21 31 1665 jul 6 aug 11 nov 30 1666 jan 14 24 mar 19 21 31 apr 4 19 may 27 30 31 jun 1 3 4 6 7 11 13 14 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 27 jul 9 29 sep 4 7 oct 3 5 7 9 10 11 12 18 nov 5 15 1667 jan 6 11 14 feb 7 28 mar 1 2 13 18 20 21 26 27 apr 9 10 13 20 may 14 15 16 19 22 23 24 26 27 28 jun 5 6 7 9 11 12 13 14 19 24 29 aug 2 oct 9 10 11 18 28 nov 19 dec 5 1668 jan 9 10 12 feb 29 mar 1 7 11 apr 1 may 23 24 25 jun 7 8 19 aug 29 sep 16 dec 22 23 1669 mar 9 family tree see this person on the pepys family tree latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
