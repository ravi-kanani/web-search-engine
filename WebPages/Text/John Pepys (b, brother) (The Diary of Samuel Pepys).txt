✹ celtcahill on 2 sep 2006 • link " the fact that he had an average, undistinguished life is hardly a matter for censure." i nearly agree with sam & l&m on this. especially in john's time & place the opportunities he's getting through his brother are not common ones, and failure to make the best use of them is a reason for censure. especially compare the background - economic and class - in which john lives. he is not merely dooming himself to a lower-class existence but his issue too. with sam using up whatever points he has to use - pulling out all the stops - to get him secured in his person and future fortune - a little more performance was to be expected. failure to succeed and be seen to succeed was a real failure. sam seems at this time to recognizee that the system is unfair and that by participating in it he is contributing to it, but he also recognizes that unfair or not, it is not an opportunity to be wasted when he has it in his gift to pass his brother to the top by his ( sam's) social graces over those who's competence alone might engender better success. l&m see that as do i. john's wasting his luck. ✹ aqua on 2 sep 2006 • link "john’s wasting his luck." only if he has the wit to know, as rabi burns said only if we have the gift to see our selves as others do. most of us will never amount to a hill of sugar, as we lead lives of quiet desperation. those that do utilize their full potential, should thank the correct switchs have been activated in the rna/dna. like beauty, only a few get to exploit it, and they fail to realise their good luck, on the most part. john did not connect with a good sponsor who was able to draw forth all that potentially within him. many fail realise that thy total environment plays a part in being allowed or forced to grow. timing in life be all important, for example year of birth can expose one to the odds of geting wiped out in an epidemic of disease or war. sam was lucky in that his cousin needed eyes in town while he rusticated on the ouse. great training to be self reliant at an age to take advantage, sam very easily could have slipped into mediocracy if there was no vacancies in volatile job market of the time. six years be making a difference in opportunities to shine as things have settled down. death and destruction are great opportunities for some as others lose their necks. desperation of need to eat helps many, sam be out of work, academic without prospects, coffee shops jobs be not available yet , did not want to be cleric, so was able fill a need for a desperate deposed admiral. john had big brother to sup off, big mistake, many have to pushed into the deep end and then use the choice, guggle or struggle. ✹ celtcahill on 3 sep 2006 • link true words, aqua. log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 jan 6 9 15 22 24 feb 5 7 8 19 20 21 22 25 26 27 mar 7 17 may 13 aug 14 sep 12 1661 jan 28 30 feb 27 apr 11 12 may 8 jul 15 sep 18 19 1662 feb 1 8 21 aug 9 oct 10 11 12 1663 jan 27 apr 4 aug 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 17 20 29 30 sep 1 3 6 15 23 24 dec 31 1664 mar 19 20 21 apr 13 27 30 may 4 26 aug 22 sep 4 oct 15 1665 mar 3 jun 22 1666 feb 21 apr 28 jun 17 18 jul 29 sep 8 9 22 27 oct 3 6 9 10 11 12 14 16 17 27 28 29 31 nov 1 7 9 11 12 21 dec 6 23 25 31 1667 jan 8 14 20 26 feb 1 2 7 8 mar 20 25 27 may 9 26 oct 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 1668 apr 1 may 24 25 1669 may 12 13 14 17 24 28 family tree see this person on the pepys family tree latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
