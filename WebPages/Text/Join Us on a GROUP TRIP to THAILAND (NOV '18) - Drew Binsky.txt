of course, we will also be having a few fun nights as well (nightlife is really fun in chiang mai and bangkok!) requirements for the group trip: there are three major requirements that you must fulfill. they are the following. ‚Äì you must be able to speak english (edit, i have removed the 18-35 age limit). ‚Äì you need to have a desire to learn how to make a living online to fund your travels (making videos, travel blogging, social media, etc) ‚Äì you need to have any kind of camera (more advanced than an iphone) and a computer ‚Äì but you don‚Äôt need any previous filmmaking skills or travel blogging knowledge! how to apply: there are 12 spots open for this trip. to apply, simply email me ([email protected]) a 60-90 second raw video explaining who you are, why you want to come and what you are expecting to get out of this trip (deadline is friday, june 15th). please do not go over 90 seconds or your application will not be considered. trip cost: the cost of this trip is $1,600usd, which will include nearly everything except your flights (you are responsible to get to chiang mai on november 10 and book your own flight out of bangkok on november 18 or later). the $1600 includes: 7 nights at hotels, 1 night at village homestay 8 breakfasts, 1 lunch, 2 dinners all transportation (buses, taxis, shuttles) to and from all activities and between all destinations hands on cooking class in chiang mai bicycle tour in sukhothai a local tour guide (who will be co-leading the tour alongside myself and deanna) daily lessons (workshops) with me about making videos, travel blogging, and making money online. i will have curated lessons planned if you‚Äôre chosen, payment must be sent to me via paypal or venmo no later than july 20th, 2018 or else your spot will be given up to someone else. this also gives me about 2.5 months to go through your applications. other things to note/bring: you will be paired up with a roommate during the trip unless you‚Äôd like to request a private room, which will cost you an additional $249 for the 8 days it is mandatory (as per g adventures) to have emergency medical insurance that covers for both emergency evacuation & repatriation to the sum of $200,000 usd. it is also strongly advised to have a cancellation/interruption insurance just in case something unexpected happens. i personally recommend bringing pocket money of $80-120 usd to cover lunches and additional spending money (souvenirs, beer, etc). make sure that you are able to obtain a visa on arrival in thailand, or you must take the necessary steps to apply for a visa in advance. pack lightly. trust me. we will be moving around a lot and you will not want to have more than a backpack of things. nothing will be fancy or the need for fancy attire. one pair of pants, one light jacket, few shirts, underwear, walking shoes, hat, sunscreen should do the trick! you can always buy things in thailand if you forget them at home! cancellation policy: as per g adventures‚Äôs, cancellation 60 days or more prior to departure = loss of deposit, cancellation between 30 and 59 days prior to departure = 50% loss, and cancellation within 30 days of departure = 100% loss. but we really hope you don‚Äôt have to cancel as we will need to find a replacement asap (and if we have issues on timing, the entire trip may be cancelled). if you need guidance for what to pack, see this video on my best packing tips! what‚Äôs in my bag? packing tips ever wonder what i bring with me on trips inside of my 2 carry-on backpacks? in today‚Äôs episode of travel tip tuesday, i share all of my secrets for how to pack efficiently and more!! have anything else to add? please share below! ‚Äòlike‚Äô drew binsky on facebook for more fun travel videos, and come say hi on insta/snap @drewbinsky music: epidemic sound posted by drew binsky on tuesday, february 20, 2018 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì that‚Äôs it!

sorry to miss it this time. reply john bushkar says: september 1, 2018 at 3:06 pm are you full? it‚Äôs sept 1, are you full for the thailand trip? i need the skills. reply backpacking in nepal says: august 21, 2018 at 8:54 am one of the most debating topics concerned with your nepal travel is the means through which you could step in the country. the capital city is most likely to be the door to enter the country and head towards the country. either you arrive by land or air, you need to avail a nepal tourist visa to continue with your nepal tourism. to have a seamless experience of nepal tourism, it is advisable that you have a pre-planned nepal itinerary. you might not have significant knowledge about nepal, hence you can contact touring companies that would have a documented nepal itinerary to guide you throughout your journey. the tourist entering the country would require a nepal visa. upon arrival at the airport, the corresponding visitors need to fill up an application form and your passport to get a nepal tourist visa. reply cally & john rivett says: august 19, 2018 at 7:36 am we are hoping to get to thailand on our sailing trip around the world!
