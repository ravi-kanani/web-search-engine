petite anglaise july 27, 2005 bristling filed under: french touch, parting ways — petiteanglaiseparis @ 12:59 pm i am rapidly coming to the conclusion that separating from someone you were not married to is actually more expensive than divorce. take france telecom for example. a couple of weeks ago, it occurred to me that my phone number was still registered in mr frog’s name. as i have always harboured a burning, secret desire to see my name in print (even if it is only in the pages blanches), and didn’t particularly want to speak to any old flames or schoolfriends that might look up mr frog at some point in the future, i decided to have the entry amended. the lady from france telecom who explained the procedure to follow was uncharacteristically helpful. a fax, signed by mr frog, authorising a transfer of the line, plus a copy of my bank details was all that was required. a couple of days later, i noted that my name already appeared in the online phone directory. that was fiendishly simple and efficient, for france, i thought to myself. and then i received the first bill bearing my name. € 55.00 – services ponctuels ou occasionnels (ouverture de ligne) i phone france telecom, to report what i am – in my misguided optimism – determined to see as an error. i haven’t just moved in, and i don’t have a new telephone number, so i can’t possibly be charged a “connection fee”, can i? first, i explain my problem to the service clients in a calm, almost cheerful manner. “but you were informed of the cost when you enquired as to what the procedure was to carry out the name change.” states the lady, voice dripping with boredom. “no, absolutely not. i was informed of no such thing!” i splutter, suffering from an acute sense of humour failure. my call is transferred to the service facturation, where i have the pleasure of starting my complaint all over again from the beginning, minus the cheerfulness. the man ascertains that i have not changed my telephone number, and (pretends to) consult with a supervisor. when he returns, he tells me it is absolutely normal to have been charged in this way. i am livid. “it’s daylight robbery,” i shout, trying desperately to think how to say “preposterous” in french, but making do with a forceful “c’est aberrant!” getting worked up like this makes no difference whatsoever to anything except my life expectancy, which is considerably shortened. when he can get a word in edgeways, mr france telecom gleefully delivers his parting shot: “there are some cases in which the transfer of a line is free. if a line is transferred between spouses, or if you were pacsé for example.” i knew mr frog and i should have got married. comments (43) july 25, 2005 wobbles in paradise filed under: mills & boon, navel gazing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 12:36 pm i asked my lover to buy a one-way ticket to paris, so that i could pretend he was here to stay for good. i had been cautioned, by many of the people who read petite anglaise and wish me well, that after the desolate lows of last week, i should be aware that spending time with my lover would no doubt prove to be a palliative therapy, relieving the symptoms and reducing the suffering without curing the root causes. problems would be forgotten, temporarily, but would not miraculously dissipate. they were not wrong. i spent a simply heavenly weekend in his company. the most mundane things, like shopping for food in the supermarket, or fetching a dvd, were blissful. we talked. we strolled around my neighbourhood. we went to bed at unlikely times of day. happiness was pottering in my flat, knowing he was in the next room making a cup of tea. sometimes i almost had to pinch myself to see whether it was all real. i think he felt the same. a couple of months ago all he knew of me was what i had written. now there he was in my apartment, contemplating the strangely familiar view from my balcony, known to him previously only as the header image at the top of this page. i was however conscious of the demons lurking just on the periphery of my vision. i would catch sight of them, fleetingly, out of the corner of my eye, and knew they were waiting to pounce in a moment of vulnerability. from time to time i would wobble dangerously: some trifling thing would bring sudden, unnecessary tears to my eyes and my spirits would plummet. a sensation of falling, similar to that which i get sometimes when hovering between sleep and wakefulness, ‘landing’ on my bed with a sudden jolt. i was torn between attempting to put on a brave face for my lover, or baring my soul and running the risk of wounding him, making him feel powerless. because even when he is with me, holding me in his strong arms, and not stranded at the other end of a phone line, there is only so much he can do to help. i chose honesty. because that is what we do best. love might not make me invincible, but as long as i am mindful of this, and know that i do still need to exorcise my demons without his help, we can weather this storm together. comments (16) july 22, 2005 sinking filed under: navel gazing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 10:02 am i fell into a hole yesterday. not literally, of course. despite the fighting talk in my last post, despite the fact that my lover is coming to stay with me for two weeks while tadpole is away on vacation with mamie et papy, i suddenly felt overwhelmingly sad. fragile. brittle. exhausted. i knew it was a temporary bout of depression, and that i wasn’t seeing things clearly, but that didn’t help. i couldn’t find my way out. tadpole was adorable. she saw me crying silent tears and came to give me a big hug. she fetched a tissue for my runny nose (i have a summer cold – it is not helping). “mummy’s tired. mummy fait dodo on di bed,” she said, maternally, climbing up onto my bed and motioning for me to join her. not that i would actually be allowed to sleep. i’d barely closed my eyes when she screeched “wake up!”, only milimetres from my right ear. i opened my eyes, pretending to have been woken with a jump, and tadpole thought this was so hilarious that we had to repeat the exercise at least ten times. there is nothing worse than finding yourself unable to muster up even the ghost of a smile when you are playing with your child. comments (24) july 18, 2005 reunion filed under: navel gazing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 1:14 pm in 1995 i would probably have ordered a snakebite and blackcurrant in a damp and dingy cellar nightclub, with a name like “the swamp” or “moles”. this weekend’s drink of choice was a pitcher of pimms and lemonade, the classiest of which was served in the private gardens of the royal crescent hotel. i think that sums up nicely how we have changed in ten years. the “reunion”, which started out as an ambitious plan to reunite a whole host of fellow “eurostuds” (european studies and modern languages graduates), was actually a rather a low-key, intimate affair. so much the better. there were two or three people i really wanted to catch up with properly, and not having to feel obliged to make polite small talk with lots of others meant i could concentrate my attention fully on those who mattered. walking around the campus alone on friday, before everyone else arrived, with 1995 vintage renaissance on my ipod, i let my feet guide me to the house where i lived in my first year. the curtains in the window bore the same leafy pattern. the trees in front had grown, and now almost obscured my third floor window. i stood there for a long while, letting memories wash over me. going to university, for me, was about becoming a new person. starting over in a place where no-one had ever known me as a bespectacled, swotty, shy teenager. leaving behind the heartache of the traumatic split with my first boyfriend, and the friends who had turned out to be more his than mine. it was about re-inventing myself. the exhilaration of living my own life, far from the constraints of the parental home, going out whenever i pleased, spending my (ahem, well, the government’s money) on precisely what i chose, answering to no-one but my own conscience. i loved my new life, my new friends and the new me wholeheartedly, and spent the happiest years of my life to date in bath. ten years later, in the process of shedding my skin and re-inventing myself all over again, i stand at a crossroads and contemplate a future far from the city of light. i like to think that ten years from now, i will no longer refer to my time in bath as the happiest years of my life.
