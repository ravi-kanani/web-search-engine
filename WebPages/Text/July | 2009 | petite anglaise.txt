petite anglaise july 22, 2009 holiday filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 1:50 pm despite the fact that… i spent one night throwing my guts up in a bathroom which smelled of eau de septic tank tadpole had to be taken to see a doctor with a suspected ear infection tadpole’s ear meds made her throw up on one of our boating trips, the boat left an island stop without us (and who in their right mind leaves a heavily pregnant woman and a six-year-old on an island in 40°c heat minus their belongings?), leaving the boy with no choice but to swim heroically after it …we had a fantastic time in turkey. the landscape was beautiful. the beaches were largely unspoilt (thanks to the presence of loggerhead turtles who nest in the area and prevent any sort of permanent construction.) the ruins made this ‘old stones’ lover very happy indeed. the food was yummy (although, predictably, tadpole lived on a diet of cucumber, tomato and chips). the people were über friendly, especially to tadpole, who now boasts a large collection of complimentary lucky eye charm beads and bracelets, and i was forced to coo over at least twenty pictures of newborn babies belonging to various waiters, taxi drivers and hotel owners. tadpole learnt how to snorkel, and the way her face mask compressed her mouth and nose, resulting in a meg ryan style trout pout provided a constant source of amusement. and the dance she performs when wearing the shocking pink, jangly coin-infested costume i bought her from a bazaar in istanbul is truly a thing to behold. but the funniest moment, in my opinion, was when we returned home to paris and i handed tadpole my phone to call her daddy, who has now whisked her away on yet another holiday. of all the things we’d seen and done, what did she tell him about? the turtles? the snorkelling? her new costume? no. ‘we saw a dung beetle daddy!’ she cried into the telephone. ‘it was rolling along a really big piece of goat poo-poo! and guess what? manuel managed to kill the plante carnivore on my princess peach ds game and he opened up a whole new level for me!’ comments (38) july 4, 2009 à titre d'information… filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:42 pm our little family of three (plus bump) is heading to turkey (more specifically, to the lycian coast) for two weeks, so things will be (even) quieter than usual around here. in the meantime, i leave you with the cover of my first novel, published as a paperback original in late august in the uk (to follow in march 2010 in canada), which is now available for pre-order on amazon.co.uk and elsewhere online. those of you who have been paying attention will note that i’d originally titled the book ‘rendez-vous’ – which is also the name of the online dating site featured in the story. the marketing powers-that-be decided to go with ‘french kissing’ instead, and i’d be quite interested to hear which title people prefer… comments (76) search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
