we translate it into an abstraction. yet, when i, an american, hear or read katzensprünge, i break that word into its constituent parts, and for a moment i really do see a cat, springing. my tentative sense of the german language means i synthesize the elements one by one. i read german the way i might read a poem—testing every word for its meaning and implication. that length of a cat’s jump isn’t an exact distance, of course, but in some sense, i experience the phrase both literally and figuratively. i note too that the two words are fused together—it isn’t that there is a cat and the cat springs, but rather the cat is inseparable from its springing forward. the thing is its motion and the motion is a thing. the distance is figured in terms of a kind of embodied motion. show your support for off assignment and be rewarded this level of metaphor isn’t unique to german; we have it in english, too. but as someone who is not a native german speaker, my feeling of perpetual estrangement throws me into negotiating the capability of words to create new possibilities of experience. it is my foreignness that keeps revealing new depths if enough time and attention is given to them. the words retain their newness for me, unlike in english, which gets immured in familiarity. that interpretive distance means one cannot take anything for granted, and cannot experience any meaning as fixed. ralph waldo emerson once wrote, “all language is fossil poetry.” encountering a word such as katzensprünge brings that latent poetry back to life, if even for just a moment. at the edges of language, caught between here and elsewhere, there is hope that if we look out of the corners of our eyes, we can sometimes catch the metaphors lying round about, hidden in the most ordinary words, in wait for the possibility of surprise. about the author richard deming’s collection of poems are let’s not call it consequence and the forthcoming day for night. he is also the author of listening on all sides: towards an emersonian ethics of reading. in 2012, he was awarded the berlin prize by the american academy in berlin. he is currently director of creative writing at yale university. he almost died in cork, ireland. photo credit: ben mciver keep reading articles mar 25, 2020 to the man named "praise god" mar 25, 2020 mar 25, 2020 mar 11, 2020 to the shopkeeper in fez mar 11, 2020 mar 11, 2020 feb 27, 2020 how not to leave the arctic circle feb 27, 2020 feb 27, 2020 feb 12, 2020 to the man i made into a stranger feb 12, 2020 feb 12, 2020 jan 23, 2020 behind the briefings: elaina plott jan 23, 2020 jan 23, 2020 jan 9, 2020 to the nun who locked eyes with me jan 9, 2020 jan 9, 2020 dec 19, 2019 to the host mother of the do-gooders dec 19, 2019 dec 19, 2019 nov 21, 2019 to the fenix who commanded authority nov 21, 2019 nov 21, 2019 nov 7, 2019 to the woman looking for the hospital nov 7, 2019 nov 7, 2019 oct 24, 2019 to the dancer who touched my back oct 24, 2019 oct 24, 2019 richard deming facebook0 twitter linkedin0 how to discover your own pacific island a supposedly fun thingalex sheshunoffmarch 09, 2017archives 2 fernweh no equivalentsophie haigneyfebruary 23, 2017germanyarchives 2 © off assignment / offassignment@gmail.com
