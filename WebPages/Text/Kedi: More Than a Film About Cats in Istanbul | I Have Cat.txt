those are moments where we’re lucky. they remind us that we’re alive.” “life is beautiful if you know how to love. you love if your heart’s eye is open….if you can enjoy the presence of a cat, a bird, a flower, what can i say….the world will be yours….” “the love of animals is a different kind of love. people who don’t love animals can’t love people either. i know that much.” several of the women commented on their admiration for the character cats have. their strong will and unapologetic attitudes and their ability to be feminine and strong. “she does what she wants, that’s important to me. that she never compromises her freedom.” “their posture seems feminine to me. i don’t see that elegance in women anymore… in a city like this it’s very difficult to be a woman, to be female, to express your femininity. to be defiant with your femininity.” the lives of the street animals and human residents of istanbul are seen as inextricably linked. “our concerns for street animals and our concerns for people are completely related to ne another. if you ask me, the troubles street cats or other street animals face are not independent from the troubles we all face… maybe we’ll solve our own problems as we try to solve theirs. in fact i’m sure that we would even regain our fading sense of humor and rekindle our slowly dying joy for life. “ the love and admiration for these comes at times from the most unexpected places. a large burly fisherman with a weathered face syringe feeds abandoned kittens. a gentle man with large hands carries an injured kitten to a vet. a slight, gentle looking man who suffered a nervous breakdown and attributes his recovery to caring for the cats walks the streets laden with plastic bags full of raw meat each day. a fishmonger gently tosses small fish to kittens, ensuring each receives one. i can only hope i’ve done this documentary justice in my write-up. and trust me when i say i haven’t even covered every aspect of the film (yes they anthropomorphize cats in istanbul just a we do here, with some very colorful projection you’re sure to get a kick out of!). kedi is a visual triumph. the filmmakers adeptly filmed and edited footage from multiple perspectives (including that of the cats). you will walk away feeling like you truly know the cats, the humans, and various aspects of life in istanbul. and the dialogue is amazing – almost as scripted (i was not joking about having transcribed the film!). they’ve done a tremendous job weaving together many themes and rich content in a seamless manner – not an easy task! not only would i recommend you go see kedi if it’s screening near you, i encourage you to purchase a copy. i’ve seen it twice and would happily see it again. this entry was posted in cats, reviews and tagged cat documentary, cats in film, cats in movies, cats on film. bookmark the permalink. ← i had my bachelorette party…at a cat cafe cats in film: 2016 → 25 responses to kedi: much more than a film about cats in istanbul summer says: february 14, 2017 at 2:02 am kedi is playing here on friday – my human and her friend will be going! i have cat says: february 14, 2017 at 4:47 pm you will love it i think! i want to purchase it! pingback: kedi: much more than a film about cats in istanbul - cats n things stephanie b. says: february 14, 2017 at 10:37 am i can’t go i the date it will be hete, i am so bummed. i have unchangeable appointments. do you the release date??
