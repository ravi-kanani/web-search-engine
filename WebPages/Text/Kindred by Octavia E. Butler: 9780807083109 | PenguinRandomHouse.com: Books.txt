it is a book that simply will not be denied; its power is hypnotic. kindred is a story that hurts: i take that to be the surest indicator of genuine art. it is an important novel, filled with powerful human insight and the shocking impact of the most commonplace experiences viewed in a new way, and it demands that once begun, the reader continue till it has done its work on the heart and mind and soul. octavia butler is a writer who will be with us for a long, long time, and kindred is that rare, magical artifact . . . the novel one returns to, again and again, through the years, to learn, to be humbled, and to be renewed. do not, i beg you, deny yourself this singular experience.”—harlan ellison “truly terrifying. . . . a book you’ll find hard to put down.” —essence “butler’s books are exceptional. . . . she is a realist, writing the most detailed social criticism and creating some of the most fascinating female characters in the genre . . . real women caught in impossible situations.” —dorothy allison, the village voice “butler’s literary craftsmanship is superb.” —the washington post book world “her books are disturbing, unsettling… in a field dominated by white male authors, butler’s african-american feminist perspective is unique, and uniquely suited to reshape the boundaries of the sci-fi genre.” —bill glass, l. a. style “one of the most original, thought-provoking works examining race and identity.” —lynell george, los angeles times “this powerful novel about a modern black woman transported back in time to a slave plantation in the antebellum south is the perfect introduction to butler’s work and perspectives for those not usually enamored of science fiction. . .a harrowing, haunting story.” —john marshall, seattle post-intelligencer related articles looking for more great reads? discover book picks from the ceo of penguin random house us close download hi res close kindred category: historical fiction category: historical fiction category: historical fiction kindred buy now hardcover feb 01, 2009 | isbn 9780807083109 buy paperback feb 01, 2004 | isbn 9780807083697 buy ebook feb 01, 2004 | isbn 9780807083703 buy see all formats (2) + close back to top connect sign up for news about books, authors, and more from penguin random house stay in touch about news careers contact us faq email preferences terms of use privacy policy do not sell my personal info resources shopping & shipping faq for educators penguinrandomhouse.biz media queries subrights permissions speakers bureau company reads global.penguinrandomhouse.com © 2020 penguin random house books series about us visit other sites in the penguin random house network brightly raise kids who love to read taste an online magazine for today’s home cook litflash the ebooks you want at the lowest prices read it forward read it first. pass it on!
