kickstart a business; life hacks; and competition ready. each lesson includes video support and tutorials, hints for students, guides, and tons of scaffolding just like they do for the teachers. in addition to these supports for students, all lessons include differentiation options, accommodation plans, assessment opportunities, and everything teachers might need to implement a successful lesson. plus, the lessons are aligned with csta, iste, and ccss standards, and also include language arts, math, and career extension options. in short, there are a ton of resources available for teachers and students in terms of support, engagement, and extension. it’s wonderful to see how much time and energy the lego® education team has put into making this an exceptional learning opportunity. for those interested in learning more about the benefits of integrating kits like this to support steam learning in the classroom, the infographic below from the lego® education team summarizes things nicely. as someone who has spent the past few years conducting research on broadening participation in stem and computer science, the importance of confidence and self-efficacy emphasized in this infographic is spot-on, and i appreciate their team’s focus on these ideas. click to enlarge finally, for those interested in a more technical breakdown and comparison of the different lego® education offerings, this post from dong liang is a helpful resource. overall, i had an absolute blast working with and reviewing the spike™ prime kit, and not just because i grew up loving everything lego. as a former middle school science and computer science teacher, i can see so many wonderful ways for integrating this type of kit into the classroom. the lego® education team really has done a wonderful job supplementing their existing education solutions with the spike™ prime. yes, the kit is great, especially for allowing students to see their programs in action, but the curriculum is also top-notch. for middle school teachers looking for a fun and engaging way to incorporate steam and computer science skills into their classroom, i absolutely recommend considering the spike™ prime. the opinions expressed in this review are my own. i was not compensated for writing this review. i received a spike™ prime kit for the duration of the review. 0 comments leave a reply. reviews here you can find the round up's collection of in-depth reviews on the latest programs, apps, websites, and more. make sure to click the review's title or the read more link for the complete review! featured check out our featured review | infercabulary: vocabulary made visual for k-12 students teach.com subscribe email * subscribe connect awards rss feed archives march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 august 2018 july 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 june 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 july 2014 june 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 april 2013 except where noted, content on this site is licensed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license copyright 2019 | michael karlin
