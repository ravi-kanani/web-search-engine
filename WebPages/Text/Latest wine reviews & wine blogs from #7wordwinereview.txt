but the main reason we think #7wordwinereview has been so popular is that it is genuinely good fun. it is light hearted, unpretentious, snappy and often downright hilarious. have a look on twitter and you’ll see a real mixture of experienced industry professionals and everyday wine enthusiasts providing equally engaging wine reviews of wines at every level, from first growths to two for a tenner. of course we are not so naive that we think #7wordwinereview represents the future of tasting notes, rendering all critics jobless (although again, we like to pretend we are) but it is a place to start. it provides a fun, friendly platform for everyone to get involved and get tweeting, talking and tasting! if you would like to get involved, you can start by securing a twitter account, and then have a search on #7wordwinereview to see what others have been tweeting. you can follow us at @12×75 to see what we’ve been tasting. just seven little words – easy! people we’d like to thank for helping push the #7wordwinereview : @bvdv @gusm_lw @winekat @supersearle @rwhbray @markbosun @scotslarder @brianm_lw @everymanwines @tomixorama @benaustinwine @iainchsh @sauternessteve @90pointwineguy @cornishop @rich_j_lewis @edh_b @p_jennerholm @jamielawrence87 @finewinestorage @oxwinecooxshop @grapenotestv @groggeruk @lawinegal @champagnegeek @majesticfwc @mnwineguy @robdellapietra @wineguff @benjamgros @rovingsommelier @sipped_surped @bigsithewineguy @susansterling @nakedwineshow @jonathanbeagle @cambwineblogger @nickswine @vineinspiration @brane-cantenac @alawine @alanbertram @pudjus @winebore @menettof @zone41 @karel_roell @warrenbobrow1 @foodwinediarist @dutchwino @eddiewat @grapeconviction @jeffharding @dittonwinetraders @roboulanger @ericawinetrips @laeti_divino @vinalytics @tara_devon @malagrinif @andolinicapital @emmanuelory @nubianor about 12×75.com 12×75 is a light hearted, comical wine blog which focuses on wine news, reviews, food & interviews with leading figures in the world of wine. we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites. articles about twelve by seventy five ltd (who have nothing to do with 12×75.com) will the real 12×75 please stand up, please stand up investment firm twelve by seventy five is not 12×75 recent posts best non alcoholic gin 2020 | buyer’s guide & reviews best tonic water of 2020 | ultimate buyer’s guide the best wine openers of 2020 | ultimate buyer’s guide & reviews most shared posts best whiskey stones 2020 | which ones are worth it?... being a native californian but living in nyc, i think i&# 28 shares best cocktail shakers in 2020 | learn how to make cocktai... cocktail shakers are used for a variety of reasons in a v 35 shares the best wine openers of 2020 | ultimate buyer’s gu... what is it about opening wine that can sometimes be so an 33 shares interviews stephen browett – farr vintners doug rumsam – bordeaux index mark schuringa – ditton wine traders adon kumar – wine searcher judy leissner – grace vineyard peter lunzer – lunzer investments james miles – liv ex mark bedini – fine+rare david elghanayan – vanquish benjamin wallace – the billionaire’s vinegar paula & stacey golding – premier cru fine wine investments henri lurton – chateau brane-cantenac nigel jagger – octavian simon berry – berry bros. & rudd aline baly – chateau coutet adam brett-smith – corney & barrow maximilian riedel – riedel tony laithwaite – laithwaite’s wine pages about us contact us subscribe #7wordwinereview power… sitemap for great london seo services click away. ©2020 back to top search search close
