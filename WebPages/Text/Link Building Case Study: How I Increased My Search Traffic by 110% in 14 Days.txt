home about newsletter menu home about newsletter link building case study: how i increased my search traffic by 110% in 14 days by brian dean · updated sep. 02, 2016 here’s the brutal truth about link building: there are way too many people in internet marketing today that think “great content” is enough. they say, “if i publish great stuff, people will naturally link to me”. if only it were that easy… if you’re serious about getting high quality links, you need to be very systematic with how you create and promote your content. otherwise you’re taking the “cooked spaghetti approach”: throwing a bunch of stuff against a wall and hoping something sticks. well today i’m going to show you a technique that almost guarantees that you get high quality links from every piece of content that you publish. keep reading to learn how… the skyscraper technique: (content marketing for link builders) on april 18th i published google’s 200 ranking factors: the complete list. after executing “the skyscraper technique“, the number of backlinks to that page shot up like a rocket: more importantly, organic search traffic to my entire site — not just that post — doubled in just 14 days: as a nice bonus, that single post has driven more than 300,000 referral visitors to my site so far. the best part? you can do the same thing for your site…even if you don’t have a fortune 500 marketing budget or connections with influential bloggers. the 3-steps to using “the skyscraper technique” to get quality links and targeted traffic there are 3 steps to the skyscraper technique. and i go over all of them in this short-and-sweet video: like i mentioned in the video above, here are the 3-steps that make up the skyscraper technique: step 1: find link-worthy content step 2: make something even better step 3: reach out to the right people here’s why this technique works so well (and what it has to do with a skyscraper): have you ever walked by a really tall building and said to yourself: “wow, that’s amazing! i wonder how big the 8th tallest building in the world is.” of course not. it’s human nature to be attracted to the best. and what you’re doing here is finding the tallest “skyscraper” in your space…and slapping 20 stories to the top of it. all of a sudden you have the content that everyone wants to talk about (and link to). now: the skyscraper technique is just one of many strategies that i use to land first page google rankings. i reveal the others in my premium business training course, seo that works. step #1: find proven linkable assets a linkable asset is the foundation of any successful link-focused content marketing campaign (including this one). i’m not sure who coined the phrase “linkable asset”, but it’s the perfect description of what you want to create: a high-value page that you can leverage for links over and over again. keep in mind that linkable asset is not “12 things spider man taught me about social media marketing” link bait nonsense. it’s content so awesome, so incredible, and so useful that people can’t help but login to their wordpress dashboard and add a link to your site. but how do you know if your linkable asset is going to be a huge success…or a total flop? that’s easy: find content that’s already generated a ton of links. here’s how: now it’s time for step 2… step #2: make something even better your next step is to take what’s out there and blow it out of the water. here’s how you can take existing content to the next level: make it longer in some cases, publishing an article that’s simply longer or includes more items will do the trick. if you find a link magnet with a title like “50 healthy snack ideas”, publish a list of 150 (or even 500). in my case, i decided to list all 200 ranking factors…or die trying. the first 50 were a breeze. 50-100 were really hard. 100-150 were really, really hard. and 150-200 were damn near impossible. it took 10 gallons of coffee and 20 hours of sitting in front of my laptop (don’t worry, i took bathroom breaks)… …but in the end, i had something that was clearly better than anything else out there. more up-to-date if you can take an out of date piece of content and spruce it up, you’ve got yourself a winner. for example, most of the other ranking factor lists were sorely outdated and lacked important ranking factors, like social signals: if you find something with old information, create something that covers many of the same points…but update it with cutting-edge content. better designed sometimes, a visually stunning piece of content can generate a lot more links and social shares than something similar on an ugly page. just check out help scout’s customer acquisition strategies for entrepreneurs: this guide is a curated list of links to other internet marketing sites. and the page has generated a lot of buzz because it’s beautifully designed. for my guide, i added a nice banner at the top: more thorough most lists posts are just a bland list of bullet points without any meaty content that people can actually use. but if you add a bit of depth for each item on your list, you have yourself a list post that’s much more valuable. in my case i noticed that the other ranking factor lists lacked references and detail: so i made sure each and every point on my list had a brief description (with a reference): important note: i recommend that you beat the existing content on every level: length, design, current information etc. this will make it objectively clear that you have the better piece of content. which is really important when you start getting the word out… step #3: reach out to the right people email outreach is the linchpin of the skyscraper technique. it’s similar to straight up link begging, but with a very important twist. instead of emailing random people, you’re reaching out to site owners that have already linked out to similar content. when you qualify prospects like this, you know that: 1. they run a site in your niche. 2. they’re interested in your topic. 3. they’ve already linked to an article on that topic. now it’s just a matter of giving them a friendly heads up about your clearly superior content. here’s how to do it: 1. use ahrefs.com to export all of the links pointing to your competitor’s content into a spreadsheet. tools like majestic seo and open site explorer will also work. 2. weed out referring pages that don’t make sense to contact (forums, article directories etc.). in my case, after cleaning up the list, i had 160 very solid prospects to reach out to. 3. i emailed all 160 of them using this template: (i obviously personalized and tweaked this template for everyone i reached out to). even i was shocked at the overwhelmingly positive response: out of 160 emails i landed 17 links: an 11% success rate. considering that these were cold emails that asked for a link in the first email, an 11% success rate is pretty amazing. you may be thinking, “17 links, that’s it?”. but remember it’s about quality, not quantity. there were a lot of gems in that group of 17 links. besides, just look at the meteoric rise in organic traffic that those 17 links got me (in a very short time period, no less). obviously there were a few links to that page that came organically, but some of the best were from the skyscraper technique. now you try it i hope you can see the potential of the skyscraper technique for your site and your business. yes, it takes hard work to create something great. but with this strategy you already know ahead of time that your hard work is going to pay off (unlike pumping out reams of content hoping that something goes viral). 755 comments 5671 shares glen says: may 16, 2013 at 7:16 pm hey brian, this is awesome content mate, thank-you. i love anything case studyish, especially when it’s start to finish and you’ve done a really high quality job. appreciate the insights. glen reply brian dean says: may 17, 2013 at 9:00 am my pleasure, glen. 🙂 let me know how it works for you. reply danny howard says: may 17, 2013 at 6:21 am hey brian, great post, really great strategy… i think reaching out to the right people is the hardest hurdle when promoting your content whether is great or astounding content if no can see or read it, then your kinda at a loose end regarding authority and brand awareness not to mention high quality links. cheers danny reply brian dean says: may 17, 2013 at 8:57 am glad to hear that you enjoyed the post, danny. you’re right: finding the right people to contact is really hard. that’s what i like about this strategy: you’re targeting people who are very likely to link to your content (because they’ve already linked to similar stuff in the past). that makes it easy to get the word out…even if you don’t already have a following. reply ashley faulkes says: may 17, 2013 at 2:25 pm hey brian, nicely done and written. i also noticed since i started blogging recently that people rehash old ideas but add nothing. but i had not made the leap that you made, or at least not a leap of that size!! fantastic idea. it is going on my list of things i need to do as a new blogger to try to get at least a trickle of traffic :> will start following your blog! cheers ashley reply brian dean says: may 17, 2013 at 2:39 pm thanks, ashley! this is a great way to drive links and traffic to your new blog. let me know if you have any questions about the process. reply chetan says: may 18, 2013 at 2:16 am once again, a fabulous post. reply brian dean says: may 18, 2013 at 9:11 am thanks chetan! i aim to please 🙂 reply josh taylor says: may 18, 2013 at 12:58 pm cool idea. but why do you have “link-building” as a topic for examples? i guess that would make this a link-building article for link-builders about link-building in the niche of link-building from link-building sites who also link to a link-building article, which gets a whole lot of links. reply brian dean says: may 18, 2013 at 1:24 pm thanks, josh. to answer your question: i guess i’m a bit obsessed with the subject. but the technique can be effective in any niche (like guitar lessons) :-). reply josh taylor says: may 18, 2013 at 2:43 pm you’re awesome brian. i’ll have to try it out. reply brian dean says: may 18, 2013 at 2:49 pm let me know how it works for you, josh! reply jason bedunah says: september 4, 2014 at 4:11 pm hi brian, you mention using this in a niche but a lot of the details don’t seem to work for niches. for example, you mentioned having 100 linking root domains in ose’s top pages but in a niche they aren’t likely to have that much. my niche is marketing specifically for software companies and while i love this article because it can help me with clients, i’m not seeing how it translates well for niches. do you have a version for niches? or, how would you modify to get significant traffic for smaller niches? thanks, jason reply brian dean says: september 5, 2014 at 9:09 am jason, that’s true. in the case of smaller niches you’ll need to go a bit lower with some of the numbers. don’t let the details stop you from trying it out. i’ve seen the skyscraper technique work in some weird niches. reply jace says: february 10, 2015 at 4:49 am hi brian, i’m finding some of the same issues as jason. top companies in our industry have only 10-15 linking root domains for their subpages. additionally, when looking at heavily shared content within the industry (via topsy), it appears that no one is getting many social shares, even for companies that have been in business for 15-30 years. at most they seem to be a couple hundred shares. so when i look at this data, i’m not sure how to interpret it. is it that competitors aren’t sharing good content, is it that people aren’t interested in what is being shared or is the target audience not being reached? i tend to feel that the competitors are on top of search pages because they have tens of thousands of links to their root domains, so don’t need to worry about publishing new, sharable content. so the idea of finding already popular content is great, but there doesn’t seem to be much of a precedent directly related to our niche. loretta says: june 28, 2016 at 12:52 pm i look forward to testing this out in some tiny niches 😉 carl says: may 20, 2013 at 4:14 am brian, i love this post and i can see lots of scope with this concept that you have shared. i will give it a try. thanks again. question if you dont mind me asking, do you have space for advert on your sites? also can you share the link to the site you used for example on this post. thanks reply brian dean says: may 20, 2013 at 6:46 am sounds great carl! let me know how it works for you. i actually don’t have advertising on the site at the moment. do you mean the example of the old ranking factors post? here it is: https://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/internet/google-ranking-factors.htm. reply andrii says: may 27, 2013 at 2:13 pm been away for a while. glad to see you still publish quality content! good job! reply brian dean says: may 27, 2013 at 2:15 pm glad to have you back, andrii! reply venchito tampon says: may 27, 2013 at 5:02 pm hey brian, thanks for sharing it. i’ll definitely try this link building strategy. you’ve given us proofs and i think it is a truly link magnet for one’s site. cool! reply brian dean says: may 27, 2013 at 5:46 pm glad you liked the post, venchito. send me an email if you have any questions. reply andrew blachut says: may 28, 2013 at 6:27 am i like the way you reverse engineer the task of getting links and the skyscraper method looks very sound indeed. i would be interested if you ever turn it into a product or service because even though i love the theory i’m not certain i’m cut out to action it…even though your explanation is thorough. running my business 12 hours a day 7 days a week leaves little time so outsourcing is critical for me these days. andrew – australia reply brian dean says: may 28, 2013 at 10:36 am glad to hear that you like the post. but you’re right: this does take quite a bit of time to implement. it’s possible to outsource each step (finding content that’s already linked to, creating the linkable asset, and email outreach) if you’re busy. reply ayah says: august 11, 2014 at 2:18 pm hi brian, you’re right it does require time but i did manage to create my content. it’s in the finance field so i hired a technical finance writer after i did the draft to clean it up to meet industry standards and to make it better than my competitors. however, i do have a question. do you have to manually get the emails after downloading the links or are they included in the report? i used ose to download the inbound links and i’m stuck. was just wondering because i assumed the emails would be included…:) reply brian dean says: august 12, 2014 at 11:42 am ayah, you have to manually find the emails. reply michael says: august 18, 2016 at 1:11 pm thanks brian. any tools you use specifically to find the emails? or do you just manually search the website until you come across their email? i feel like many websites don’t just publicly display their emails liz hancock says: may 29, 2013 at 9:10 am thanks for the information on ose and the top linking pages technique. just another way to perform valuable competitor research! reply brian dean says: may 29, 2013 at 9:38 am glad you liked the ose top pages tip, liz 🙂 reply newer comments leave a comment cancel comment your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment
