(update – now i’m at 57 countries) here is a recap of my day on snapchat: the 57 countries are: usa, canada, colombia, brazil, czech republic, austria, italy, spain, portugal, finland, france, latvia, lithuania, estonia, hungary, norway, poland, slovakia, switzerland, germany, uk, serbia, slovenia, bulgaria, romania, moldova, ukraine, turkey, korea, japan, taiwan, hong kong, philippines, indonesia, thailand, china, malaysia, singapore, india, sri lanka, georgia, australia, new zealand, fiji, egypt, uae, macau, qatar, costa rica, bahamas, trinidad and tobago, malta, kuwait, bahrain, oman, russia, azerbaijan, kazakhstan and counting! i have proof of the majority of them via snapchat stories, photos and receipts that i’ve saved over the years. here is a snapchat collage of me eating at a few recent mcdonald’s: before i explain why i enjoy eating at mcdonald’s so much, let’s look at some mccrazy facts: 35,000 – the number of locations around the world, second to only subway for the most restaurants on earth. 118 – the number of countries that you can find the golden arches. 68 million – the amount of people that eat mcdonald’s everyday 1.7 million – the number of employees worldwide 75 – the number of hamburgers mcdonald’s sells every second but why on earth would you eat that fast food when you’re traveling? you are crazy! haha.. please let me explain. along with meeting local people from around the world, eating local foods is my favorite part about traveling. i shouldn’t have to explain why, because i’m certain that just about everyone reading this as obsessed with eating local foods as i am. but when you travel full-time, and live out of a 40 liter backpack for 6 months nonstop, you’re only able to eat local foods for so long… in india, i could only stand curry for a few weeks before i got sick of it. in korea, kimchi and rice is only good for so many consecutive days. i eat local foods 95% of the time, but when i get sick of it, i resort to mcdonald’s. and every time, it hits the spot. for the remainder of this post, i will leave you with “10 grand reasons why i love eating at mcdonalds around the world:” 1. cultural experience the experience inside of a mcdonald’s varies from country to country, and i find it fascinating. in some countries, like korea for example, you’ll often see entire families out to dinner inside of a fancy mcdonald’s restaurant. yes, fancy – i’m talking about 60 inch samsung tv screens, multi-level, lounges, and games for kids. in the usa, it’s very rare to see entire families eating at mcdonald’s – it’d be an embarrassment to be seen eating mcdees in public. in other countries, i’ve seen mcdonald’s be the “hang out” spot for 20-somethings. and believe me or not, i’ve seen amazingly attractive employees in some mcdonald’s (hello japan, serbia & romania). you just never know what you’re gonna get. 2. free wifi sometimes, i’ll go to mcdonald’s just for the free wifi. i’ve never been to a mcdonald’s without it, and for me, having wifi is essential because i work online. many countries don’t have a lot of free public wifi, and other countries have extremely slow signal speeds. mcdonald’s solves both of those problems. you can almost think of it like a café. just grab some food (or just coffee), and bust out some work. 3. different menu items almost each country has it’s own unique menu item(s) — catering to the taste buds of the local people. did you know that mcdonald’s are vegetarian restaurants in india? i didn’t either, until i went and saw myself. some of my favorites local menu items that i’ve tried were: – bulgogi burger in korea – durian smoothie in singapore – mcspaghetti in the philippines – mcfalafel in israel – samurai pork burger – thailand – tartar balls – romania (shown in photo below) 4. clean bathrooms this one is a life saver. when i was traveling around india in 2015 and using squatter-toilets 75% of the time, i always saw mcdonald’s as an opportunity to use a nice bathroom. they are always clean and maintained. 5. save money if you’re a budget traveler like myself, then you’ll know how much money you can save by eating cheaply. yes, it might not be the healthiest options, but there are alternatives to keep yourself healthy (hit the gym!). i rarely spend more than $8usd on any meal, and you can pretty find anything on a mcdonald’s menu for less than $8 (unless you’re in norway, switzerland or finland…). 6. good a/c tired of sweating your butt off after walking 5 miles around the city in the baking hot sun? you can be sure that there is a/c in every mcdonald’s! when i was in cairo, i was sweating an entire layer through my shirt and it was completely stuck to my body. i couldn’t find a/c anywhere (including my hotel and taxis). i only saw it in high end restaurants and of course, mcdonald’s. i literally sat inside a mcdonald’s in cairo for 1 hour just to cool off. i remember doing this in singapore as well. so necessary. 7. taste of home mcdonald’s is such a familiar taste to me, and somehow it satisfies my body. you’re going to think i’m crazy for saying this, but sometimes when my stomach is upset or not feeling well , i will eat at mcdonald’s to help me feel better. and it works. maybe it’s just my subconscious, but i think the familiarity of my stomach has something to do with it. 8. unique mcflurries in japan, try a kit-kat & strawberry mcflurry. or how about a pistachio in italy? almost every country has their own unique blend. 9. it’s comfortable inside mcdonald’s is a great place to relax after your body is exhausted from touring around a city. most of them have tv’s or some kind of entertainment in the form of games. i will often go to mcdonald’s just to get a coffee and hang out to get some work done. what’s wrong with that? 10. the mcdelivery did you know that you can order mcdonald’s on the phone in 18 countries and they will deliver it straight to your door? i did this a few times in korea and it was awesome. and last but not least — it’s good yeah, i actually enjoy eating a big mac and fries. and not everything on the menu is so unhealthy – look into the chicken wraps or salads. those are tasty too! i hope after reading this article you can understand the reasoning behind why i love to eat at mcdonald’s around the world. i’m lovin’ it. please comment with your thoughts and opinions! about latest posts drew binsky a graduate from the university of wisconsin-madison, drew binsky has visited 190+ countries since 2012.he first caught the travel bug while studying abroad in prague, then taught english in korea, and now he's on a mission to visit every country on earth.follow his journey on youtube & instagram @drewbinsky 🙂 latest posts by drew binsky (see all) my 2018 recap: 35 new countries visited - january 3, 2019 iran is not what you think!! - july 3, 2018 join us on a group trip to thailand (nov ’18) - may 22, 2018 posted in travel post navigation how i got 50k followers on snapchat (8 tips) understanding snapchat marketing (insider tips) 19 thoughts on “list of all countries i’ve eaten mcdonald’s at (and why)” natasha says: march 4, 2020 at 1:17 pm love this article. like that you keep it so down to earth reply syed areeb says: september 8, 2019 at 2:29 am hey drew interesting to know you visited so many mcd’s is there any outlet whereby one gets to try all the wordwide menu of mcd … like coca cola hq at atlanta has got all drinks available they have to offer is there any such mcd reply pingback: 25 best travel tips i’ve picked up from 80+ countries - sbbuddy pingback: 25 best travel tips i’ve picked up from 80+ countries – kaleyadams kanika bakshi says: january 2, 2019 at 4:08 am nice article. keep traveling and post this type of article in future and thanks for the information that u have shared that which all countries have mcdonald’s franchise. reply kanika bakshi says: november 5, 2018 at 6:56 am hahaha, mc donald is the life savior thing for everyone, people get sick most of the time they visit abroad, but i must agree that every country serves a diff mac donald taste. i have also been to a lot of places and i found the quality quantity and taste all are different from the each county reply susan athey says: july 13, 2018 at 3:41 am i love checking out the different menu items and ice cream flavors in mcdonald’s – beer in germany and green tea ice cream in hong kong. reply john says: july 10, 2018 at 6:21 am mcd outside the usa is generally competently administered and the food just as good if not better than mcd in the usa. the question is if mcd is a third-world business, or is mcd an island in the third-world countries where it is located. i tend to think it is a good example of american business practices brought to other countries. what do you think?

i didn’t either, until i went and saw myself. i just wanted to tell you this is not true. i come from new delhi and you get all sorts of chicken burgers here in india.not even new delhi, most of the cities have non-vegetarian mc donalds. i am not sure as to which city you visited in. but, yeah there are many non-veg mc donalds in india:) reply drew binsky says: july 28, 2016 at 1:13 am thanks for your input! i didn’t know that all mcdees weren’t vegan in india reply surekha subramaniyan says: july 29, 2017 at 11:57 am hi, just to also clarify… vegetarians (esp those in india) are different from vegans… they consume dairy, some consume eggs, but not meat or fish. that said, agree with rajat, a veg only macd may have been a specialty, most of the mcdonalds in india have atleast some similar items to the ones in singapore, a lot of mcds in middle east, and even canada (places i’ve lived). reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment * name * email * website recent posts my 2018 recap: 35 new countries visitedjanuary 3, 2019 iran is not what you think!!july 3, 2018 join us on a group trip to thailand (nov ’18)may 22, 2018 best places to visit in summer 2018may 12, 2018 highlights from a 6 day road trip in floridaapril 3, 2018 most popular posts why i launched this new blog, & what’s next for me… how i afford to travel full-time teaching english in korea 25 best travel tips i’ve picked up from 80+ countries list of all countries i’ve eaten mcdonald’s at (and why) ask me anything! please leave this field empty.
