is it including all of the meat with very little fat? a quick and easy recipe for making sure you are serving your novel up perfectly- your query should consist of: the hook: an intro including logline (a one-sentence refined summary that boils the work down to its broadest definition, word count, and genre. this is also a good point to include any comparable titles: ‚Äúthis is ___ meets __‚Äù). the book: four to five sentences explaining the premise. the cook: a bit about the author. basically: why this book, why me, why now. if you can check these boxes, let‚Äôs take a look at the pages themselves. most agencies are looking at the first ten pages and a synopsis of your work. so: 4. how is your first line? they are so important! we want that first line to drop the hook in the agent‚Äôs mouth and pull. a quick and easy litmus test: go your bookshelf and pull several titles and read the first line out loud. (some of my personal favorites are sena jeter naslund‚Äôs ahab‚Äôs wife, andy weir‚Äôs the martian, lee childs‚Äô killing floor, and graham brown‚Äôs black rain.) take a beat to assess what works about the opening line. does yours deliver as well? 5. after you‚Äôve hooked us with that first line, we are turning our attention to the first ten pages of the manuscript, so are those first ten pages in the best shape possible for literary agents to look at? are they giving a hint that whatever to come is unputdownable? 6. finally, how is your synopsis? it should be three to five paragraphs, and get into more about the characters and their conflicts. it is not a detailed pitch, but a true summary. thus it should explain the full story arc, sometimes even including a solid hint at the ending, even if it‚Äôs with that old chestnut ‚Äúand a twist that [the character] never saw coming‚Äù. we‚Äôre at the checkered flag, one last round we go‚Ä¶before you start your submissions, let‚Äôs crash course a couple of other flags to make sure you are communicating with reputable agents: 7. reading fees: green flag reputable literary agents will confirm that they only get paid when you get paid. no legit agent will ask for a reading fee. ever, at any point. we get paid when you get paid. period. red flag an agent that has a conversation about fees at the submission stage. 8. media presence: green flag: reputable agents will have a website or at least a page on publishers marketplace detailing clients and sales. red flag: an agent who reaches out through a social media account with no other media presence. 9. submission plan specifics: green flag: an agent should be able to tell you which imprints‚Äîand sometimes even specific editors‚Äîshe is considering sending the book to, and why. red flag: an agent who says broad terms concerning submissions like ‚Äúharper collins‚Äù or ‚Äúpublishers‚Äù. an agent who says they want to represent the work based on the query or before they have read the full manuscript. 10. references: green flag an agent should connect you to another client(s) as reference upon offering representation. red flag: an agent that makes excuses on why you cannot speak to any current client. literary agents: go nab a good one okay, grab your resolve and start your resoluting! i‚Äôll be peeping my peep toes waiting for your query! tweet pin share related posts how joining a virtual book club can help deal with coronavirus stress by marissa decuir you are what you read: bookshelves of the famous by laura tong 4 killer ways to find ideas for your next bestseller by dave chesson about the author barbara poelle barbara poelle is vice president at the irene goodman literary agency, representing a variety of genres but focusing on suspense, thriller, upmarket and young adult fiction. her book funny you should ask: mostly serious answers to mostly serious questions about the book publishing industry based on her writer‚Äôs digest column of the same name, arrives in bookstores jan 14, 2020. you can visit her at funnyyoushouldaskbook.com or irenegoodman.com/barbara-poelle ‚Üêprevious post next post‚Üí join over 2 million readers the best hosting option free course- sell more books with amazon book ads are you an author who wants to sell more books?
