live chat support allows customers to have text-based conversations with support teams via the web. using live chat software embedded on the company‚Äôs website, customers can send their questions to a person (or sometimes an ai bot) who can quickly reply to them in the same small window. the ‚Äúlive‚Äù part of live chat support is a reference to real-time, back-and-forth conversation, as opposed to email support where there may be no expectation of an immediate reply. some tools, like help scout‚Äôs beacon, combine true real-time live chat with a hybrid messaging option, allowing both synchronous and asynchronous conversations to happen in the same chat tool. live chat software is also used for purposes beyond support ‚Äî for example, to enable sales conversations. however, live chat software, which is built for delivering great support, may include additional support-focused features such as deep integration with knowledge base and help desk tools. the benefits of live chat as a support channel why should you offer live chat support to your customers? because customers love it! studies show that live chat is the preferred choice of many customers, and it has the highest customer satisfaction level of any support channel. considering the key benefits of live chat support can help you decide whether it is the right choice for your business. live chat support is highly accessible live chat software can be integrated right into your customer‚Äôs workflow through a consistently available button or link on your website or in your app. your customer doesn‚Äôt need to hunt down a special contact page or dig up an email address; they know exactly where to go when they need help. that accessibility reduces customer effort, an important factor in building customer loyalty. live chat support delivers useful context embedding live chat right into the customer‚Äôs process gives them the best chance of explaining exactly where they are stuck and what they need. good live chat software will let the agent know where the customer is in the process and what they were doing before asking for help. that gives both parties a head start in understanding the problem and determining the solution. live chat support is timely a customer who receives an excellent response to their email enquiry in an hour or two may be satisfied with your service, but a customer who receives the exact same answer in real-time via a live chat will often be much happier because they can continue on with their task immediately. if your customer is considering making a purchase, renewing their account, or asking for a refund, a solid answer provided quickly can make a real financial difference to your company. live chat support is conversational many people are more comfortable expressing themselves through chat conversation than through more formal writing. effective email support puts demands on the customer to explain their issue clearly and provide all the relevant details, tasks at which customers are not always experts. live chat support breaks those interactions into smaller chunks and allows the support agent to lead a customer through the process by asking the right questions in the right order. what could be a days-long, back-and-forth conversation through email might instead be a 10-minute chat. of course, you can‚Äôt just switch on live chat and expect to see the benefits instantly flowing in. rolling out live chat support requires some careful planning and intentional design. make your website or app more helpful with beacon suggest relevant help content, offer live chat, and give customers instant access to their support history ‚Äî all without leaving your site. free 15-day trial adding live chat support into your customer service experience adding a brand new support channel to your service offering isn‚Äôt a step to take lightly. often you will be taking your existing resources (your team, their working hours, and their set of skills) and giving help across more locations. that can be a stretch. before you leap into offering live chat support everywhere at once, consider these questions: who will you offer live chat support to? you don‚Äôt need to make chat an option for every customer or prospect who visits your site. perhaps you offer live chat to your vip clients or to newly onboarding customers. where is live chat support most valuable? are there pinch points in your app or sales funnel where having a real-time conversation can help people get unstuck and maintain their momentum? consider providing live chat support only at those moments, at least initially. how will you balance your support channels? look at the time and skills you have to work with, and decide how many hours you can feasibly cover with live chat support. compare that to the support volume you have incoming through your other channels, and decide on a sustainable mix between them all. you won‚Äôt get it right the first time, but you can make an educated guess. how will live chat integrate with your existing help desk or crm? the more you know about your customers and their past history with you, the better service you can offer. choose a live chat support tool that will connect each chat conversation with what you already know about that customer so you don‚Äôt lose valuable context. what training or resources will you need? give your team the best possible chance to succeed by reviewing their backgrounds and skills and providing them with some guidance on what good chat support looks like. giving great service through live chat is a different skill set than email or even phone support. as you integrate your new live chat support channel, begin collecting data about what is working, how customers are reacting, and where your team might need additional help to deliver the best possible support experience. live chat support best practices delivering consistently great customer service through live chat is not easy, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. we‚Äôve spoken to customer service folks about their experiences and collected the following best practices. live chat support best practices as a manager if you‚Äôre responsible for setting up and managing the live chat support channel, there are some moves you can make to improve the experience for your staff and for your customers. keep the incoming volume manageable. your customers look to chat for quick, accessible interaction with your team. if your chat team struggles to keep up, the customer experience will suffer. use reporting to keep an eye on the overall volume and response time, and take action if needed. consider offering chat only during certain time windows, or to certain customer groups, as a way to control volume. don‚Äôt overload your individual support agents. a typical support agent can handle two or three concurrent chats without losing service quality, but that depends heavily on the type of questions they are answering and the levels of experience of both customer and agent. you should be able to set a maximum chat number so that no one team member is overwhelmed with chat requests. 6 live chat customer service best practices for agents here are the six best practices any live chat support agent will need to follow in order to deliver consistently good service. 1. manage the conversation like being on the phone with that one aunt, chats can spin out of control. being able to bring a chat back to the purpose of the conversation is helpful. pro tips: get on the same page ‚Äî make sure you and your customer are both talking about the same thing. set expectations ‚Äî let them know if you need to step away or if they will need to wait. build boundaries ‚Äî have prepared responses for tough situations, like customers being abusive. switch channels smoothly ‚Äî if you need to move a chat to email or phone, do it gracefully. 2. increase your speed in live chat, responsiveness counts for a lot. it‚Äôs better to share the first part of your answer and build your customer‚Äôs confidence than to wait until your whole answer is ready. pro tips to speed up your chat support: improve your typing speed ‚Äî is it time to give mavis beacon one last job?
