frontend masters is the best place to get it. they have courses on all the most important front-end technologies, from react to css, from vue to d3, and beyond with node.js and full stack. comments goose permalink to comment# july 6, 2017 when the article starts with ‚Äúi‚Äôve switched all my local wordpress development over to local by flywheel‚Äù, is that chris speaking, or the sponsor. if it‚Äôs not chris, he should be more careful of the content of sponsored content because it reads as though he‚Äôs started using flywheel when he hasn‚Äôt. chris coyier permalink to comment# july 6, 2017 it me. dalton permalink to comment# july 6, 2017 i was one of the ones who voted for local in the earlier poll. it‚Äôs a great piece of software, i‚Äôve been using it since the early days when it was a paid product. i‚Äôll also add that it‚Äôs not just for wordpress, although it‚Äôs clearly optimized for wp. it also works great for craft cms, as well as others, i‚Äôm sure. james permalink to comment# july 6, 2017 if anyone has a quick, pain-free way of migrating a bunch of local sites from desktopserver, then i‚Äôd be onto it. pd permalink to comment# july 6, 2017 reading your https section, i thought you were going to say someone had solved this annoying certificate exception malarkey. with let‚Äôs encrypt automating ssl certificates, when will we start to see transparent use of https within applications like this? we should be able to get certificates and use them in dev scenarios just as easily as production, shouldn‚Äôt we? the add exception thing is an oddity that will hopefully be consigned to the past soon. sam permalink to comment# july 7, 2017 sounds good! i‚Äôll be trying this out on the weekend! thanks brendan permalink to comment# july 7, 2017 hey chris, awesome suggestion, thanks so much for posting! from playing around with it this morning i can already tell it will save me tons of time and i‚Äôm sure it will get even better. one snag i ran into was getting the external server address to work on codekit ‚Äì were there any extra steps you ran besides what you showed in the article above? i turned on ‚Äòexternal server required‚Äô and added my .dev address from local, but the codekit preview icon still links out to the bonjour address. the .dev address works, but codekit doesn‚Äôt auto-refresh it. just curious if you did something else that i didn‚Äôt pick up on! brendan permalink to comment# july 7, 2017 welp, i‚Äôve got egg on my face! i didn‚Äôt realize that custom dev domains weren‚Äôt part of the deal with codekit. it‚Äôs working exactly as it should. jon christensen permalink to comment# july 7, 2017 ever since the the poll article, i had the (mis)fortune of moving to a new development machine. when i did, i decided to give local a whirl, as it looked pretty good at that time, and i was looking into other setups. i really think it has helped me a lot in my local development workflow versus my old setup (mamp pro). since i do development on osx and windows (crazy, right?), i actually liked that i could use the same program in both places in the same way. and for free too! it has really sped things up for me as well by setting the wp install defaults and then doing a pull down of a site with wp db migrate pro. i can pretty much be up and running with a site in a few minutes. qa likes that i can send them ‚Äúpreview‚Äù links of issues we‚Äôre fixing, and i like that it is easier to debug on mobile and my vms. i‚Äôm thinking i may recommend our whole dev team be on it, but we‚Äôll see. i‚Äôve already seen a few updates for the program since i got it, so it seems like they‚Äôre continuing to improve it. katherine permalink to comment# july 7, 2017 would love to see a walk through video jamie bell permalink to comment# july 10, 2017 hey katherine! we have a nice lil‚Äô demo video of local by flywheel here: check it out! jordan permalink to comment# july 7, 2017 hey chris, you mentioned using wp migrate db pro. what is it that you enjoy about it? have you tried the all in one migration plugin? it exports your entire site into a single file for upload. database, files, everything! you need to pay for the unlimited extension for large sites, but it‚Äôs a one off fee. https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/ chris coyier permalink to comment# july 8, 2017 there are no files at all with wp db migrate pro, it just communicates directly between local & production (or any two sites, really) and does its thing. gary pickles permalink to comment# july 9, 2017 hi, have you tried all in one word migration with local flywheel, i couldn‚Äôt get it to activate after installing it? gary mic sumner permalink to comment# july 10, 2017 also important to note is that local by flywheel is completely free! and that they‚Äôve got a great community forum/discourse where you can ask and expect a quick reply. the community forums‚Äô vibe is really good. but it‚Äôs important to note as well that this is wordpress only. ale permalink to comment# july 16, 2017 is very good, yes. other program good is desktopserver, it allow all the things you‚Äôre write and direct deploy to production server, but much of this things are paid. anyway, the two alternatives are great. this comment thread is closed. if you have important information to share, please contact us. how do you stay up to date in this fast‚Å†-‚Å†moving industry?
