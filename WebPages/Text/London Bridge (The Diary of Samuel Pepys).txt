the northern ascended to higher ground at the present site of cornhill. between the embankments, the river thames could have been crossed by ford when the tide was low, or ferry when it was high. both embankments, particularly the northern, would have offered stable beachheads for boat traffic up and downstream – the thames and its estuary were a major inland and continental trade route from at least the 9th century bc.[3] there is archaeological evidence for scattered neolithic, bronze age and iron age settlement nearby, but until a bridge was built there, london did not exist.[4] a few miles upstream, beyond the river's upper tidal reach, two ancient fords were in use. these were apparently aligned with the course of watling street, which led into the heartlands of the catuvellauni, britain's most powerful tribe at the time of caesar's invasion of 54 bc. some time before claudius's conquest of ad 43, power shifted to the trinovantes, who held the region northeast of the thames estuary from a capital at camulodunum, nowadays colchester in essex. claudius imposed a major colonia at camulodunum, and made it the capital city of the new roman province of britannia. the first london bridge was built by the romans as part of their road-building programme, to help consolidate their conquest.[5] roman bridges the first bridge was probably a roman military pontoon type, giving a rapid overland shortcut to camulodunum from the southern and kentish ports, along the roman roads of stane street and watling street (now the a2). around ad 55, the temporary bridge over the thames was replaced by a permanent timber piled bridge, maintained and guarded by a small garrison. on the relatively high, dry ground at the northern end of the bridge, a small, opportunistic trading and shipping settlement took root and grew into the town of londinium.[6] a smaller settlement developed at the southern end of the bridge, in the area now known as southwark. the bridge was probably destroyed along with the town in the boudican revolt (ad 60), but both were rebuilt and londinium became the administrative and mercantile capital of roman britain. the upstream fords and ferries remained in use but the bridge offered uninterrupted, mass movement of foot, horse, and wheeled traffic across the thames, linking four major arterial road systems north of the thames with four to the south. just downstream of the bridge were substantial quays and depots, convenient to seagoing trade between britain and the rest of the roman empire.[7][8] early medieval bridges with the end of roman rule in britain in the early 5th century, londinium was gradually abandoned and the bridge fell into disrepair. in the anglo-saxon period, the river became a boundary between the emergent, mutually hostile kingdoms of mercia and wessex. by the late 9th century, danish invasions prompted at least a partial reoccupation of the site by the saxons. the bridge may have been rebuilt by alfred the great soon after the battle of edington as part of alfred's redevelopment of the area in his system of burhs,[9] or it may have been rebuilt around 990 under the saxon king æthelred the unready to hasten his troop movements against sweyn forkbeard, father of cnut the great. a skaldic tradition describes the bridge's destruction in 1014 by æthelred's ally olaf,[10] to divide the danish forces who held both the walled city of london and southwark. the earliest contemporary written reference to a saxon bridge is c.1016 when chroniclers mention how cnut's ships bypassed the crossing, during his war to regain the throne from edmund ironside (see battle of brentford (1016)). following the norman conquest in 1066, king william i rebuilt the bridge. the london tornado of 1091 destroyed it, also damaging st mary-le-bow.[11] it was repaired or replaced by king william ii, destroyed by fire in 1136, and rebuilt in the reign of stephen. henry ii created a monastic guild, the "brethren of the bridge", to oversee all work on london bridge. in 1163, peter of colechurch, chaplain and warden of the bridge and its brethren, supervised the bridge's last rebuilding in timber.[12] "old" london bridge (1209–1831) an engraving by claes visscher showing old london bridge in 1616, with what is now southwark cathedral in the foreground. the spiked heads of executed criminals can be seen above the southwark gatehouse. after the murder of his erstwhile friend and later opponent thomas becket, archbishop of canterbury, the penitent king henry ii commissioned a new stone bridge in place of the old, with a chapel at its centre dedicated to becket as martyr. the archbishop had been a native londoner and a popular figure. the chapel of st thomas on the bridge became the official start of pilgrimage to his canterbury shrine; it was grander than some town parish churches, and had an additional river-level entrance for fishermen and ferrymen. building work began in 1176, supervised by peter of colechurch.[12] the costs would have been enormous; henry's attempt to meet them with taxes on wool and sheepskins probably gave rise to a later legend that london bridge was built on wool packs.[12] after colechurch's death, isembert, a french monk who was renowned as a bridge builder, was appointed by king john to complete the project.[13] construction was not finished until 1209 during the reign of king john. john tried to recoup the cost of building and maintenance by licensing out building plots on the bridge but this was never enough. in 1284, in exchange for loans to edward i, the city of london acquired the charter for the maintenance of the bridge, based on the duties and toll-rights of the former "brethren of the bridge". the bridge was 26 feet (8 m) wide according to some records that were later disputed.[14][15] the structure was about 800–900 feet (240–270 m) long, supported by 19 irregularly spaced arches, founded on starlings set into the river-bed. it had a drawbridge to allow for the passage of tall ships, and defensive gatehouses at both ends. by 1358 it was already crowded with 138 shops. at least one two-entranced, multi-seated public latrine overhung the bridge parapets and discharged into the river below; so did an unknown number of private latrines reserved for bridge householders or shopkeepers and bridge officials. in 1382–83 a new latrine was made (or an old one replaced) at considerable cost, at the northern end of the bridge.[16] the buildings on london bridge were a major fire hazard and increased the load on its arches, several of which had to be rebuilt over the centuries. in 1212, perhaps the greatest of the early fires of london broke out on both ends of the bridge simultaneously, trapping many people in the middle. houses on the bridge were burnt during wat tyler's peasants' revolt in 1381 and during jack cade's rebellion in 1450. a major fire of 1633 that destroyed the northern third of the bridge formed a firebreak that prevented further damage to the bridge during the great fire of london (1666). detail of old london bridge on the 1632 oil painting "view of london bridge" by claude de jongh by the tudor period, there were some 200 buildings on the bridge. some stood up to seven storeys high, some overhung the river by seven feet, and some overhung the road, to form a dark tunnel through which all traffic had to pass; this did not prevent the addition, in 1577, of the palatial nonsuch house to the buildings that crowded the bridge. the available roadway was just 12 feet (4 m) wide, divided into two lanes, so that in each direction, carts, wagons, coaches and pedestrians shared a single file lane six feet wide. when the bridge was congested, crossing it could take up to an hour. those who could afford the fare might prefer to cross by ferry, but the bridge structure had several undesirable effects on river traffic. the narrow arches and wide pier bases restricted the river's tidal ebb and flow, so that in hard winters, the river upstream of the bridge became more susceptible to freezing and impassable by boat. the flow was further obstructed in the 16th century by waterwheels (designed by peter morice) installed under the two north arches to drive water pumps, and under the two south arches to power grain mills; the difference in water levels on the two sides of the bridge could be as much as 6 feet (2 m), producing ferocious rapids between the piers resembling a weir.[17] only the brave or foolhardy attempted to "shoot the bridge"—steer a boat between the starlings when in flood—and some were drowned in the attempt. the bridge was "for wise men to pass over, and for fools to pass under."[18] the southern gatehouse became the scene of one of london's most notorious sights — a display of the severed heads of traitors, impaled on pikes[19] and dipped in tar and boiled to preserve them against the elements. the head of william wallace was the first to appear on the gate, in 1305, starting a tradition that was to continue for another 355 years. other famous heads on pikes included those of jack cade in 1450, thomas more in 1535, bishop john fisher in the same year, and thomas cromwell in 1540. in 1598, a german visitor to london, paul hentzner, counted over 30 heads on the bridge:[20] .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} on the south is a bridge of stone eight hundred feet in length, of wonderful work; it is supported upon twenty piers of square stone, sixty feet high and thirty broad, joined by arches of about twenty feet diameter. the whole is covered on each side with houses so disposed as to have the appearance of a continued street, not at all of a bridge. upon this is built a tower, on whose top the heads of such as have been executed for high treason are placed on iron spikes: we counted above thirty. evelyn's diary noted that the practice stopped in 1660, following the restoration of king charles ii,[21] but heads were reported at the site as late as 1772.[22] in 1666, the great fire of london first destroyed the bridge's waterwheels, preventing them from pumping water to fight the fire, and then burned one third of the houses on the bridge; a gap in the building left by a previous fire in 1633 prevented the destruction of the rest.[23] drawing of london bridge from a 1682 panorama london bridge in 1757 just before the renovation, by samuel scott. over the years, incidents of arches collapsing were recorded in 1281–82 and in 1437. a survey in 1683 provided specifics as to the bridge's dimensions, stating that it had been 15 feet wide but was recently widened to 20 feet.[24] considering the houses, the width actually available for traffic however, was only about 12 feet.[14][15] a recently rediscovered list of leases from the 17th century provided a great deal of information, including the size and location of the 124 houses, the chapel, the gate and the drawbridge tower.[15] by 1710, most of the houses on the bridge had been rebuilt in the restoration style and in order to widen the roadway to 20 feet (6 metres), the new houses were built overhanging the river supported by wooden girders and struts which hid the tops of the arches.[25] in 1722 congestion was becoming so serious that the lord mayor decreed that "all carts, coaches and other carriages coming out of southwark into this city do keep all along the west side of the said bridge: and all carts and coaches going out of the city do keep along the east side of the said bridge." this has been suggested as one possible origin for the practice of traffic in britain driving on the left.[26] a fire in september 1725 destroyed houses on the bridge's east side and damaged some on the west side; they were rebuilt.[14] the last houses to be built on the bridge were designed by george dance the elder in 1745,[27] but even these elegant buildings had begun to subside within a decade.[28] in 1756, the london bridge act gave the city corporation the power to purchase all the properties on the bridge so that they could be demolished and the bridge improved. while this work was underway, a temporary wooden bridge was constructed to the west of london bridge. it opened in october 1757 but caught fire and collapsed in the following april. the old bridge was reopened until a new wooden construction could be completed a year later.[29] to help improve navigation under the bridge, its two centre arches were replaced by a single wider span, the great arch, in 1759. demolition of the houses was completed in 1762 and the last tenant departed after some 550 years of housing on the bridge.[30] under the supervision of dance the elder, the roadway was widened to 46 feet (14 metres)[31] and a balustrade was added "in the gothic taste" together with fourteen stone alcoves for pedestrians to shelter in.[32] however, the creation of the great arch had weakened the rest of the structure and constant expensive repairs were required in the following decades; this, combined with congestion both on and under bridge, often leading to fatal accidents, resulted in public pressure for a modern replacement.[33] the remains of the bridge, as sketched by william alfred delamotte on 30 march 1832 london bridge from pepper alley stairs by herbert pugh, showing the appearance of london bridge after 1762, with the new "great arch" at the centre. old london bridge by j. m. w. turner, showing the new balustrade and the back of one of the pedestrian alcoves. one of the pedestrian alcoves from the 1762 renovation, now in victoria park, tower hamlets. a similar alcove from the same source can be seen at the guy's campus of king's college london. a section of balustrade from london bridge, now at gilwell park in essex. a relief of the hanoverian royal arms from a gateway over the old london bridge now forms part of the façade of the king's arms pub, southwark. "new" london bridge (1831–1967) the demolition of old london bridge, 1832, guildhall gallery, london. new london bridge in the late 19th century. in 1799, a competition was opened to design a replacement for the medieval bridge. entrants included thomas telford; he proposed a single iron arch span of 600 feet (180 m), with 65 feet (20 m) centre clearance beneath it for masted river traffic. his design was accepted as safe and practicable, following expert testimony.[34] preliminary surveys and works were begun, but telford's design required exceptionally wide approaches and the extensive use of multiple, steeply inclined planes, which would have required the purchase and demolition of valuable adjacent properties.[35] a more conventional design of five stone arches, by john rennie, was chosen instead. it was built 100 feet (30 m) west (upstream) of the original site by jolliffe and banks of merstham, surrey,[36] under the supervision of rennie's son. work began in 1824 and the foundation stone was laid, in the southern coffer dam, on 15 june 1825. spare corbels for london bridge left behind at swelltor quarry on dartmoor, devon. they lie beside the former narrow gauge plymouth and dartmoor railway. the old bridge continued in use while the new bridge was being built, and was demolished after the latter opened in 1831. new approach roads had to be built, which cost three times as much as the bridge itself. the total costs, around £2.5 million (£229 million in 2019),[37] were shared by the british government and the corporation of london. rennie's bridge was 928 feet (283 m) long and 49 feet (15 m) wide, constructed from haytor granite. the official opening took place on 1 august 1831; king william iv and queen adelaide attended a banquet in a pavilion erected on the bridge. in 1896 the bridge was the busiest point in london, and one of its most congested; 8,000 pedestrians and 900 vehicles crossed every hour.[19] it was widened by 13 feet (4.0 m), using granite corbels.[38] subsequent surveys showed that the bridge was sinking an inch (about 2.5 cm) every eight years, and by 1924 the east side had sunk some three to four inches (about 9 cm) lower than the west side. the bridge would have to be removed and replaced. sale to robert mcculloch rennie's "new" london bridge during its reconstruction at lake havasu city, arizona, march 1971. rennie's "new" london bridge rebuilt, lake havasu city, 2003. in 1967, the common council of the city of london placed the bridge on the market and began to look for potential buyers. council member ivan luckin had put forward the idea of selling the bridge, and recalled: "they all thought i was completely crazy when i suggested we should sell london bridge when it needed replacing." on 18 april 1968, rennie's bridge was purchased by the missourian entrepreneur robert p. mcculloch of mcculloch oil for us$2,460,000. the claim that mcculloch believed mistakenly that he was buying the more impressive tower bridge was denied by luckin in a newspaper interview.[39] as the bridge was taken apart, each piece was meticulously numbered. the blocks were then shipped via the panama canal to california and trucked from long beach to arizona. the bridge was reconstructed by sundt construction at lake havasu city, arizona, and re-dedicated on 10 october 1971. the reconstruction of rennie's london bridge spans the bridgewater channel canal that leads from the uptown area of lake havasu city and follows mcculloch boulevard onto an island that has yet to be named. the london bridge that was rebuilt at lake havasu city consists of a frame with stones from rennie's london bridge used as cladding. the cladding stones used are 150 to 200 millimetres (6 to 8 inches) thick. some of the stones from the bridge were left behind at merrivale quarry at princetown in devon.[40] when merrivale quarry was abandoned and flooded in 2003, some of the remaining stones were sold in an online auction.[41] modern london bridge view of london bridge from a boat passing under cannon st railway bridge the current london bridge was designed by architect lord holford and engineers mott, hay and anderson.[42] it was constructed by contractors john mowlem and co from 1967 to 1972,[42] and opened by queen elizabeth ii on 17 march 1973.[43] it comprises three spans of prestressed-concrete box girders, a total of 928 feet (283 m) long. the cost of £4 million (£57 million in 2019),[37] was met entirely by the bridge house estates charity. the current bridge was built in the same location as rennie's bridge, with the previous bridge remaining in use while the first two girders were constructed upstream and downstream. traffic was then transferred onto the two new girders, and the previous bridge demolished to allow the final two central girders to be added.[44] the current london bridge, pictured in january 1987. the skyscraper in the background is the national westminster tower (tower 42), opened six years earlier. in 1984, the british warship hms jupiter collided with london bridge, causing significant damage to both the ship and the bridge. on remembrance day 2004, several bridges in london were furnished with red lighting as part of a night-time flight along the river by wartime aircraft. london bridge was the one bridge not subsequently stripped of the illuminations, which are regularly switched on at night. the current london bridge is often shown in films, news and documentaries showing the throng of commuters journeying to work into the city from london bridge station (south to north). an example of this is actor hugh grant crossing the bridge north to south during the morning rush hour, in the 2002 film about a boy. on 11 july 2009, as part of the annual lord mayor's charity appeal and to mark the 800th anniversary of old london bridge's completion in the reign of king john, the lord mayor and freemen of the city drove a flock of sheep across the bridge, supposedly by ancient right.[45] london bridge facing south towards the shard london bridge with new barriers installed in 2017 on 3 june 2017, london bridge was the target of a terrorist attack. three terrorists used a rented van to ram pedestrians walking across the bridge, killing three. the attackers then drove their vehicle to nearby borough market, where they stabbed multiple people, five of whom died. armed police arrived on scene and shot the three suspects dead. in addition to the eight people killed in the attack, 48 were injured.[46] as a response, security barriers were installed between the bridge's pavement and road. on 29 november 2019, five people were stabbed, two of them fatally, in a knife attack carried out by usman khan at fishmongers' hall, on the north side of the bridge. several people fought back on the bridge, including a man who used a narwhal tusk as a weapon.[47][48] the perpetrator was shot and killed by police.[49] transport the nearest london underground stations are monument, at the northern end of the bridge, and london bridge at the southern end. london bridge station is also served by national rail. in literature and popular culture the nursery rhyme "london bridge is falling down" has been speculatively connected to several of the bridge's historic collapses. rennie's old london bridge is a prominent landmark in t. s. eliot's poem the waste land, wherein he compares the shuffling commuters across london bridge to the hell-bound souls of dante's inferno. gary p. nunn's song "london homesick blues" includes the lyrics, "even london bridge has fallen down, and moved to arizona, now i know why."

(latham and matthews, companion). in 1831 it was replaced with a new bridge 180 feet upstream, and this was later replaced in 1973. ✹ susanna on 1 feb 2003 • link here's a nice article (with an illustration of c. 1600) on the old london bridge, from, oddly enough, a medieval tent fanatic: http://midtown.net/dragonwing/col9802.htm and here it is, with the roofs of its houses, on the 1746 map of london: http://www.motco.com/map/81002/seriessearchplates… ✹ roger miller on 2 feb 2003 • link i was interested to see the refererence to souvenirs made from the pilings of the original london bridge in the article linked to above by susanna. we have in our family two wooden egg cups, one of which has a label on the bottom with the following hand written inscription: "this cup is formed out of a portion of the oak piles on which the orginal london bridge was built in the year 1016 making at this time (1850) 834 years since the piles were placed". i have always been rather sceptical of the authenticity of these egg cups but i suppose it is possible that they really were made from the remains of the bridge. the cups were inherited from my great uncle jack (charles john munk) who was killed on the somme in 1916 aged 22. they were almost his only possessions and are mentioned in the letter that he wrote to be given to his parents in the event of his death. ✹ sam sampson on 2 aug 2003 • link the london bridge museum & educational trust are planning a museum in the southern abutment space of sir john rennie's london bridge. their website has an excellent history of the bridge, and the museum proposal looks fascinating. http://www.oldlondonbridge.com/index.shtml there's a view of london bridge circa 1600 on the 'shakespeare sonnets' site. "from a photo-chromolithograph made for the new shakspere society, from a drawing in pepys' collection at magdalene college, cambridge. this is reputed to be the earliest genuine view of london bridge." http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/london.htm ✹ peter roberts on 26 nov 2003 • link there is an informative, illustrated page about the inhabited bridge, that links & complements sam`s ref. above. its by the old london bridge society that i founded! we`ve more news when our own web site is up and running. for now, i`m a grateful `guest contributor` at the address below, please check it out: http://arthurlloyd.co.uk/londonbridge.htm ✹ glyn on 15 jul 2004 • link this picture depicts the frost fair of 1683. http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/london… on the left bank you can see st mary-le-bow church with its dragon weathervane, the monument and the tower of london just beyond london bridge. southwark cathedral is on the right bank. apparently the temple gardenwall is on the left which means that (a) there is a lot of foreshortening in the perspective, and (b) the ice extended a long way. if pepys (then aged 49 or 50) is anywhere in this drawing, i suspect him to be the man on the lower left walking with the lady. ✹ sjoerd on 19 jul 2004 • link interesting to read the explanation of the "booths" on the ice;for instance there is a "duke of york coffee house" and a "tory booth". interesting when you read about the politics of the time, see http://www.wordiq.com/definition/abhorrers thanks glyn ✹ glyn on 20 apr 2005 • link for the record, there are at least three models of old london bridge on display in london. absolutely the best one is in the entrance to the church of st magnus the martyr (can anyone take a photo of this one?). to find the church, stand at the monument and look downhill to the river and it is the church that's directly across the road. if it is closed, you can still see fragments of the later london bridge in the churchyard, and a wooden roman harbour post from 2000 years ago. the biggest model is in the docklands museum. the third is badly lit and displayed, and nothing special, but is the most accessible because it is in the museum of london. ✹ dirk on 20 apr 2005 • link virtual reality tour london bridge around 1500 http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/society_culture/arch… ✹ cgs on 13 apr 2008 • link another view : hollar: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/image.aspx?compi… interesting site for perusing london of peeps. ✹ dirk on 13 apr 2008 • link london bridge virtual reality tour the old link is not functioning any more - use this one: http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/launc… ✹ bill on 11 jul 2013 • link london bridge (old), a stone bridge over the thames from london to southwark, 926 feet long, 60 feet high, and 40 feet broad, built between 1176 and 1209, under the superintendence of peter of colechurch, chaplain of the former church of st. mary colechurch, in the old jewry. this bridge stood about 200 feet east of the present structure in the line of fish street hill, just by the church of st. magnus, and consisted of twenty arches, a drawbridge for larger vessels, and a chapel and crypt in the centre, dedicated to st. thomas of canterbury, and in which the said peter of colechurch was buried in 1205. ---london, past and present. h.b. wheatley, 1891. ✹ bill on 26 jun 2015 • link when the first editions of this diary were printed no note was required here. before the erection of the present london bridge, the fall of water at the ebb tide was great, and to pass at that time was called "shooting the bridge." it was very hazardous for small boats. the ancient mode, even in henry viii.'s time, of going to the tower and greenwich, was to land at the three cranes, in upper thames street, suffer the barges to shoot the bridge, and to enter them again at billingsgate. see cavendish's wolsey, p. 40, ed. 1852 life of the duke of somerset in fox's acts, vol. vi., p. 293; life of bp. hall, in wordsworth's eccl. biog., iv., 318, ed. 1853. ---diary and correspondence of samuel pepys, the diary deciphered by j. smith. 1854. ✹ san diego sarah on 16 oct 2019 • link london bridge was residential shopping mall as well as a major thoroughfare. the advantage of being on the bridge was that shops quickly became widely known, they were part of clusters of shops in the same trade, and the location was prestigious. rents were especially high at the northern (london) end. the typical bridge shop throughout history was the haberdasher’s, selling a wide range of goods including paper and parchment, hats, under-garments and almost any small items. but there were also grocery shops, glovers, cutlers, bowyers or fletchers. these gave way in the late 17th century to a more miscellaneous range of shops, selling, among other things, stationery, pins and durable goods such as scales and trunks. in 1633, a maidservant left a bucket of hot ashes under a staircase overnight and all the houses on the northern part of the bridge were burnt down. it was not fully rebuilt until 1682–83, by which time the roadway there had been widened to 20ft. the city of london was determined to widen the rest of the bridge, but wanted to keep the houses and also not to pay anything (a familiar refrain throughout history in every country!). the city achieved this by indicting the leaseholders for ‘nuisance’ caused by the fronts of their houses and the cross buildings (making large sections of the bridge into mini-tunnels). if the leaseholders rebuilt, leaving 20ft for the roadway and with cross buildings at second-floor instead of first-floor level [americans: add one floor], they could have 61 year leases at the existing low rents. the leaseholders complied, with appropriate complaints, and the new houses were somewhat more regular than their predecessors, with a consistent back line. they compensated for lost ground in front by extending further backwards over the river on mostly sturdy carpentry. in 1695, there were 551 inhabitants, comprising 101 heads of household (92 men and nine women), 84 wives, 67 sons, 87 daughters, 75 male servants (probably all apprentices), 82 female servants and 55 others, such as lodgers. most of the leases granted in the 1680s ended in the 1740s, which coincided with a slump in the property market. the creation of the west end meant that the importance of the bridge had declined as a shopping street as well. much more information and some great illustrations at https://www.countrylife.co.uk/architecture/living… ✹ san diego sarah on 17 oct 2019 • link terry f reports having a problem with the link about london bridge link (above). it works fine for me ... if you have a problem seeing the pictures, or something else, please speak up so we can give phil clues about what is happening (it's not the first time we have noticed this problem). since i don't want to deprive you of the pictures, here's the link again: https://www.countrylife.co.uk/architecture/living… log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 feb 2 jul 4 aug 5 15 sep 10 20 dec 6 26 1661 jan 10 29 feb 3 mar 22 25 may 18 jun 3 4 12 jul 27 sep 2 12 nov 15 dec 3 1662 mar 24 jun 25 30 aug 8 nov 17 1663 may 27 jul 13 27 aug 11 1664 apr 5 jun 15 24 jul 6 21 oct 26 1665 jan 27 jun 25 30 jul 17 23 sep 14 nov 22 28 dec 12 1666 jan 24 jun 10 30 jul 8 sep 2 oct 22 1667 feb 24 mar 24 may 5 jun 9 13 30 1668 may 11 15 aug 22 sep 21 nov 2 1669 mar 23 maps see all places in this category on one map latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
