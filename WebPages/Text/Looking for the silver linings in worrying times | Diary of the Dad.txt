home about as seen in work with me/contact 40 before 40 newsletter disclosure privacy policy diary of the dad an award-winning uk dad blog family life looking for the silver linings in worrying times by tom on thursday, march 26, 2020 well, where to start, eh? these are unprecedented times, the like of which we only usually expect to encounter in films. there’s so much to worry and feel down about and, by using the phrase ‘silver linings’ in this post, i’m not trying to downplay the severity of the situation we find ourselves in. it’s truly terrible and, at the moment, it’s difficult to stay positive. but that’s exactly what we all need to do. i feel especially sad for the kids. while we’ve never known anything like this either, it’s so much harder for them to get their heads around it. the only thing i’ve experienced remotely like this was the great storm of 1987. there was widespread disruption, school closures and shops were out of stock. but only for a day or two. so, for kids especially, it’s really important for us parents to stay as upbeat as possible – they’re looking to us for reassurance and guidance after all. with this in mind, i’ve been thinking about all of the knock-on effects of the coronavirus pandemic and, although the way in which they have come about is the last thing we want, there are some things we should feel good about. i know not everything will apply to everyone. being in an at-risk category – i have asthma – and in a contract job, i’m as worried as anyone about how things could yet affect us. but here are some silver linings i’m keeping myself going with. more family time yes, ideally, the kids would be in school. and, yes, i find it much easier working in an office than at home. but the extra time i’m getting with my family is something i’m glad of. with no commute plus a lunch hour, i’m getting three more hours a day with my lot and it’s lovely being around more again. less pollution with all the flights grounded, train services reduced and fewer cars on the road, there’s much less pollution. and that can only be a good thing. it will go a long way towards reducing emissions and might change people’s thinking about how to get around once the pandemic is over. bringing out the best in the early days of the pandemic, we’ve undoubtedly seen the worst in some people. we’ve witnessed the selfishness of panic buyers and the arrogance of those whose social plans are apparently more important than the health of their communities. but there have also been plenty of examples of people going above and beyond to help others. just look at the nhs staff on the frontline and those who have helped elderly neighbours. and i think there will be an increase in community spirit as the weeks and months progress. fresh perspective it’s all too easy to get preoccupied with things that don’t matter and micro-manage our lives without looking at the bigger picture. but the situation we’re in now will force people to think again. whether that’s to be considerate to others, think about what they truly need or to realise the folly of who they allowed into 10 downing street, there are bound to be some changes in attitude, most of which will hopefully be for the better. on a related note, this situation could change perceptions about working culture – check out john’s excellent post on the topic. saving money if you’re having to work from home, you’re probably saving on public transport or petrol, as well as things like coffee and lunch. similarly, as we’re currently in lockdown, there are fewer opportunities to spend money. of course, i would rather have our usual freedoms back, but silver linings of making savings – where possible – for the future aren’t bad. more creativity they say that necessity is the mother of invention and i think that’s true. the day-to-day challenges brought up by this crisis are going to require inventiveness to overcome. and we take so many things for granted that creativity seems to be a dying art. if people get back in touch with their innovative sides, this can lead to great things. clearing the ‘to do’ list the need for us all to stay in our own homes is, without question, frustrating. but the extra time we’re spending indoors means there’s a chance to address things we’ve been putting off. we’ve all got odd jobs that have been waiting for ages and it feels good keeping busy and finally ticking them off the ‘to do’ list. learning new skills staying at home also presents the opportunity to learn new skills – or rediscover forgotten ones. i’ve become a dab hand at diy jobs around the house and have also started cooking again. since starting my not-so-new job, it hasn’t been practical for me to cook as often as i’d like and i had convinced myself i was no good at it. not so – i’ve still got it! healthier diets having limited access to grocery deliveries has forced our hand with meal planning and we’ve reduced the amount of meat we eat as a result. we’ve cut down on wine too. while i have no plans to completely give up either, i’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll stick to our leaner diet once this is all over. more appreciation of others when this horrible situation is a thing of the past and life returns to normal, i like to think people will appreciate each other more. while i talk to people i know on my way to and from work, i’m guilty of keeping my head down if they’re not about. it’s time for the art of communication to make a much-needed comeback and it’ll be great to interact with other people again. so let’s keep thinking of silver linings and look forward to them becoming realities once this dark chapter is over. coronavirus mental health 0 previous post related posts family life i’ve taken myself for a mug family life goodbye old house, hello new home family life five things i’m looking forward to about moving house leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. comment name email website this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed. about me i'm tom briggs. a proud dad of three and, somehow or other, the writer of a multi-award-winning dad blog. i've been writing diary of the dad since 2010 and it's gone from a small hobby to my full-time job. i still have the same enthusiasm for this blog as i did when i wrote my first post and hope you enjoy reading my musings as much as i do writing them. if you're a journalist looking for a dad's point of view, you may want to check my as seen in page. similarly, if you're a pr or brand, please visit my work with me page. finally, if you want to get in touch with me, my email address is: tom@diaryofthedad.co.uk follow me as seen in recent posts looking for the silver linings in worrying times i’ve taken myself for a mug goodbye old house, hello new home five things i’m looking forward to about moving house ah well, never mind search for: awards and rankings archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 categories categories select category 40 before 40 baby and toddler blogging books budgeting charity christmas comment days out education family life fashion father’s day films food and drink football health and fitness home and garden lifestyle mother’s day motoring nine to five parenting pregnancy sleep special occasions tech toys and games travel tv uncategorized video games work theme by scissor themes proudly powered by wordpress
