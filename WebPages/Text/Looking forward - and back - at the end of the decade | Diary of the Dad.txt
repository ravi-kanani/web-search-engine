home about as seen in work with me/contact 40 before 40 newsletter disclosure privacy policy diary of the dad an award-winning uk dad blog family life looking forward – and back – at the end of the decade by tom on tuesday, december 31, 2019 well, where to start, eh? another year is just about over and so, indeed, is another decade. so it’s time for all the clichés about the passing of time, looking forward and also looking back. this year has been quite a mixed bag. it started with high hopes of blog work picking up again and a long-awaited house move. unfortunately, neither of those things happened this year. thanks to the ongoing debacle that is brexit, there was even less paid work available for bloggers, so i had to take a major change in direction and get a job working for someone other than myself. it was a bit of a shock to the system after four years of being my own boss, but i have to admit that it’s nice not having to worry about paying the bills every month. luckily, i’ve ended up in a great team and have already had my contract extended until the end of 2020. and this leads to another big positive. we will finally be moving house next year! just when we’d given up all hope of anything happening, someone looked around, loved it and made an offer. the following day, we did likewise and are really looking forward to moving into our new home. so the next decade will begin in a similar fashion to the one we’re just finishing. it was in 2010 that we moved into our current home, albeit with a child on the way. and, to quickly extinguish any questions about this move being a carbon copy of 2010, that’s not happening again this time!
