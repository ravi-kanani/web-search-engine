hecklerspray grown up gossip & internet villainy luke perry has passed away at age 52 march 4th, 2019 by krysta fitzpatrick beverly hills 90210 was one of my favorite shows growing up. i mean, i was definitely a bit too young to be watching it, but my mom didn’t really seem to mind. i wanted to be brenda walsh or kelly taylor, and brendan walsh and dylan mckay were like my sexual fucking awakening. all these years later, my love for luke perry came back full throttle as he starred as fred andrews on riverdale–a show i mocked, then became obsessed with. given my 25+ year love of luke perry, i am literally fucking devastated to announce that he has passed away at the very young age of 52. perry suffered a serious stroke recently, but it seemed like everyone was pulling for him and thought he would recover. but he didn’t. luke perry was really young and not knowingly sick as far as i know, and was on the biggest guilty pleasure show in existence right now. people fucking love luke perry. i fucking love luke perry. sometimes writing this blog is awesome, because sometimes i just get to admit that i’m on team jordyn now and not team khloe (fuck off, khloe kardashian, you have me exhausted), but days like this it’s just a bummer. sometimes i don’t even want to post about the deaths, but that just seems selfish. rest in peace, luke perry. you’re an eternal heart throb and i honestly don’t know what archie is going to do without you. leave a comment cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * notify me of new posts by email. a mediocre rundown of the 2019 oscars so the jodyn and tristan thing is probably true tristan thompson allegedly cheats on khloe kardashian with jordyn woods lil xan is having a kid and i can't deal with that katy perry and orlando bloom are engaged blogroll rumorfix hecklerspray.com copyright © 2019 · · terms · privacy · dmca · contact
