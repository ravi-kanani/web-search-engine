skip to content mmo juggler playing multiple mmos and trying to keep sane. eso – in the background the other mmo i play these days is eso. i’ve devoted far less time into it that lotro or even wow which i want to change. first, eso has a lot of the quality of life enhancements i missed from wow classic. free mount, actual fast travel, not needing to grind to money just to get the basics in the game like skills or minor (vendor) gear upgrades… funny thing about that – i was dirt poor in eso for months until i was able to grab one of those 100,000 gold daily rewards. i mentioned it during blaugfest when i grabbed my first 100k gold… and the fantastic news is that it happened again recently! yes, that’s right, i (and presumably other players that also logged in enough during the time) collected another 100k gold and i no longer have to worry about paying for the basics anymore. i can buy gear upgrades from vendors, i can deconstruct everything for research without having to pinch pennies and sell it all, i can train my horse every day. heck, i can train a horse on two characters! which is what i’m doing. my woodelf stamina nightblade has almost maxed out her horse, while my new argonian magicka warden is at the beginning of many weeks of horse training. what drew me back, besides ennui in wow, was the free eso trial in late jan. there are nice benefits but the main one is the infinite crafting bag. so, i did the trial just to clear out my characters and bank of crafting stuff and put it into the bag. and it’s pretty nice… what i didn’t realize is the crafting bag is shared across all characters. that’s a huge advantage eso has over wow, where there is no shared storage and moving stuff between characters involves a miserable one hour delay on in-game mail. without the sub and crafting bag, eso at least has shared bank space and instant transfers. i liked it so much, i re-installed eso on my pc and did the trial there as well. i’m mostly playing eso on my ps4 but i figured might as well plan for every contingency. 😉 my nightblade is level 20 and done with the summerset storyline quest, but before leaving the island and pursuing the original main quest, i have a few minor explorations to do (mostly find a few other wayshrines). my warden headed straight out of the elsweyr tutorial to davon’s watch (after doing abode of ignominy, the first delve) and found the hooded figure, starting the original main quest. i have fun with my nightblade but i want a character that would be a good healer, as in, has a healing skill line – yes i know everybody can wield a restoration staff but my nightblade is a stamina char for one, and i don’t want to split my skill points around just yet. although there is only one conflicting skill morph between umbral assassin (the build i’m following for my nightblade) and blood magus (the nightblade healing build). so between templar and warden i decided to give the warden a go, making an argonian because they look cool. and, get healing skill bonuses. i’m following the warden initiate build, and note there are no conflicting skill morphs with master herbalist, the healing build. perhaps i’ll branch off to that build later. in the meantime i’ll grab a restoration staff and throw in the occasional skill point into my restoration skill line and green balance skill line (warden-only healing skill line). i really like the skill system in eso. armor and weapons are freely usable by all classes, every class has 5 builds (2 magicka builds, 1 stamina build, 1 healing build, 1 tank build), guilds and races have skill trees – it’s fantastic. combat does seem a bit off compared to tab-target gcd mmo combat i’m used to, but i can adapt a bit. graphics are incredible, it is certainly state of the art in that department. mmos offer all the killing you want, and usually crafting as a side activity, but eso also added in thief/stealth content in the thieves guild dlc, along with supporting game systems and a skill line. so they are already trying to innovate in the somewhat stale or more charitably described “well explored” mmo space. i’m considering subscribing to eso, for the crafting bag, crowns, and xp buffs. dlc access is nice too but i’m years behind in expansion storyline and zone questing already. 😉 i just figure after my wow sub expires i might throw in to eso for a few months. author mmojugglerposted on 2020/02/052020/02/05categories eso2 comments on eso – in the background lotro – qualify of life i have yet to meet up with my friend that plays on arkenstone, we apparently have almost perfectly offset schedules, but that’s fine – i decided to make the best of it and join some “alts” to a kinship that is looking to level up and do the soa content. i put “alts” in quotes because i have no other higher level chars on arkenstone (other than the level boosts i used) and i’ll probably wind up playing these lower level chars more. i decided to start a lore-master and also a rune-keeper. i have the least experience playing rk and captain, so i thought i’d try one of those classes. as for the lm, i wanted to try one again. the lm was one of my original main characters on landroval, until i accidentally deconstructed their legendary weapon, mistaking its overall level. oops! rather than searching for another one, making do with the much lower level one i was left with, i decided to play my guardian for a bit until the sting of my mistake wore off. and the guardian took over and i never switched back. my original main char on landroval was a hunter, which was fun (i find all the classes to be fun) but i want to have more flexibility that only being dps. so i’m unlikely to seriously play a hunter or champion, leaving me with only 8 other classes to choose from which is plenty! playing lotro makes me so happy – i love the music and setting, storyline, classes and heck, even the quests although most quests are old school kill or escort quests. but many are humorous or tell a small story or have great writing. other games may look better but i think lotro does just fine in the graphics department. my character feels powerful. i know over the years the devs have tweaked damage and experience gain, but at level 31 my lore-master hasn’t had a defeat and quests plenty fast (compared to my priest in wow!). i’m expecting that to change but even twice as long killing enemies will be faster than i remember back on the original soa days. another major draw is the quality of life additions lotro has that wow classic doesn’t. fast travel in lotro is actual fast travel – horse rides a few seconds, loading screen, you appear at the destination. flying in wow classic can still take 20+ minutes to reach your destination. this was an issue i had trying to quest in un’goro crater from being based in ironforge – it was a flight, ship ride, flight to gadgetzan, then another 5-10 mins on the mount, just to get to where the mobs were. ugh! lotro allows multiple milestones (analogous to having multiple hearthstones in wow) and traits to lower the cooldown all the way to 5 mins. these are store items, but i’m vip with coins to spend on decreasing downtime so i can spend more time playing the game. lotro has in-game mail that actually delivers immediately (one hour in wow classic), shared storage (not in wow classic), you get one large bag from the start, and between not charging for skills (original lotro did charge characters to learn their skills but that went away possibly a decade ago at this point), quest rewards, and daily login rewards, i have plenty of money to buy a mount, repair gear, and purchase supplies for crafting… without specifically farming gold. i just play and it’s great. to help starting off on a new server, i bought some coins in the store. i don’t mind throwing in some money in lieu of a sub. i bought my characters extra milestone skills, milestone cooldown skills, and a stack of 5 experience scrolls, the +100% variety. i joined a kinship that wants to run the content on-level, with the current goal of the level 50 instances in angmar (urugarth, carn dûm, barad gúlaran) – so my goal is to get my lm to the high 40’s asap. to that end, if i’m questing for an hour, i’ll pop an experience scroll. after than runs out is when i do other tasks such as distributing items between chars, riding out to grab a horse point for the first time, a class quest, or minimal crafting so i can harvest at the next higher tier. once we have enough players to run the instances, i suppose we’ll all play an elaborate game of character-leap-frogging to level up to the next group of instances. author mmojugglerposted on 2020/02/022020/02/03categories lotroleave a comment on lotro – qualify of life wow – waning motivation i’m currently on a one week break from wow, crunching the numbers on my future in the game. it’s still fun, and the classic server has been great for me to run instances i’ve never been in before: blackfathom deeps, razorfen downs, uldaman, zul’farrak, maraudon, sunken temple, etc. i’m in the low 50’s on my priest (level 52.5) and things have slowed down quite a bit. my previous fighting technique hasn’t changed, but the downtime has. i need to drink water to recover mana every two fights… or finish off the last 50% of an enemy by wanding to let mana recover. both result in a similar amount of downtime which feels much higher that it was in earlier levels. i keep an eye on lfg but i’m in that in-between where (i think) players rush from 50 to 55 so they can do lbrs/ubrs, stratholme, scholomance; meanwhile the brd groups i can do are slim pickings. and zf or earlier don’t really get me experience or gear upgrades. i missed the leveling wave of players in my guild – one day a bunch of us were in the low 50’s and wanted to try the initial fights in brd (but they already had a priest so i didn’t go), the next, everyone was level 55+ wanting to move on to the aforementioned dungeons players do when they are level 55+. i have around ~10 hours a week i can play, which means on a typical weekday if i can’t find a group *quick* i just wind up working on crafting. that’s why i’m now 225/225 cooking and fishing. 😉 if i persisted, i’d get over this hump, hit level 55, suddenly qualify for the pre-raid end game dungeons… the catch is do i actually have time for it? say i do put in the time and effort to get there – it’ll be a slow road to gear up and keep going given my overall time constraint. back to the 10 hours a week, that doesn’t favor a game where the group content is the main draw and ihmo, wow’s group content is why people play and subscribe, because the pve content is not that compelling. and, a lot of time in wow is wasted doing things like traveling. anyway, i decided to take a small break and try out lotro and eso again (well it isn’t like i quit those games, i was just focusing on wow) and ponder what to do. author mmojugglerposted on 2020/01/292020/01/29categories wow2 comments on wow – waning motivation wow – hooked i haven’t been this hooked on an mmo since guild wars (in the 2005-20007 time frame) or lotro (in the 2007-2009 time frame). i can’t play as much now as i could back then, but i’m fairly consistent in getting an hour or two every day on average. my main char is suhl, a discipline priest, currently level 38. i keep an eye on lfg for groups that need healing in appropriate dungeons, and it’s been a lot of fun so far. deadmines, stockades, gnomeregan, scarlet monestary… next up is uldaman after i gain a few more levels. most of my leveling from 31 has been in scarlet monastery’s various wings, and it’s been good to me as far as loot and gear upgrades, but at the same time i’m looking forward to something else. i will run scarlet monastery a few more times, because i finally got the quest in the name of the light, which is to kill 4 bosses that i’ve already killed many times (well, healed for groups that successfully killed the various bosses). the prerequisite involved killing 30 undead ravagers in desolace (level ~38 mobs) so i went off and did that – which took a while as a discipline priest, lots of bubbles (power word: shield) and wanding. that’s fine because i don’t have much downtime otherwise (positive spin on “it takes so long to finish off a mob most my mana regenerates”) and was never really at much risk. i don’t mind a few more trips into scarlet monastery. after all, i still need whitemane’s chapeau to complete my scarlet monastery collection of gear. 🙂 my alt is eresat a holy paladin. this class grew on me, i was bored of it in the mid teens and nearly ready to give up. but i pushed a few more levels and things got better. i can’t remember anything specific, but it was probably a combination of gaining a few more skills so there was something to do besides mostly auto-attacking and refreshing buffs. eresat started as a protection paladin, but after my disastrous warrior tanking attempt i decided to switch to the healing spec instead. i figured, if i can’t tank as a warrior when that class actually has threats and taunts, i’m screwed on a paladin where there aren’t any. the general plan was to follow in my priest’s footsteps and jump in to heal various dungeons and otherwise landscape quest along. so far i’ve also healed deadmines, shadowfang keep… but i’ve also successfully tanked deadmines and stockades!! both of those tanking efforts were at the urging/plea of my friend who wanted to run those dungeons and had trouble finding a tank. thus, a literal in-game knight to the rescue. i figured, what the heck, let’s give it a try. at the time eresat was level 27 or so, out-leveling deadmines and at the upper end of the range of stockades. and, to my pleasant surprise, it went well! obviously, out-leveling the dungeon really helped, but i found tanking on the paladin was doable, even in the healing spec, and it was even less stressful than tanking on the warrior. that’s because the paladin can run two skills to passively generate threat or do damage (retribution aura and righteous fury), so i just had to pop consecration and a seal (of righteousness or crusader) on cooldown, which was a light enough mental load (for lack of a better term) i could swap targets and pay attention to the overall fight better. when something peeled off, i could swap targets and/or chase it down. so i’m willing to tank on my paladin, but only when i’m at the upper level range of the content. otherwise i can heal, also when i’m at the upper end of the level range, and this flexibility is fantastic. eresat is currently level 30 and i’ll consider sm: graveyard in a few more levels, for example. my 3rd character is a druid that gets scraps of playtime since i can’t really play three characters. i started as a feral druid, decided i wanted to try balance instead, so i payed the respec fee. unfortunately, i find balance to not be much fun, it feels low damage and my downtime recovering mana is long. i did heal my friend’s instance group, but feel weaker since the druid doesn’t have utility/emergency skills (like my priest’s fade, to help drop threat; or power word: shield to buy a few crucial seconds in a heavy damage situtation), and itemization is tougher. that is, there isn’t as much leather armor with caster stats. my druid is currently level 23 and since i already respec’ed, doing another one costs 5 gold. ugh!! 5 gold is painful but i suppose it is better than effectively abandoning the character. if i were lower level, say mid teens, i seriously would just start a replacement druid to avoid this ridiculous respec fee. i’m trying to save up for a mount for my priest and it’s tough to part with that much gold. on the other hand, a mount apparently costs 100 gold (ouch!! 20 for the skill, 80 for the mount; minus 10% for reputation… so “only” 90 gold) 5 gold is just a fraction of what i need. but i don’t have much gold in general, heck just buying skills as i level doesn’t leave much left over. i guess i need to get serious about farming. author mmojugglerposted on 2019/12/052019/12/12categories wowleave a comment on wow – hooked wow – terrible tank the other day i was in a deadmines group, with a tank that had trouble keeping aggro. it was as bad as you can imagine: uncontrolled mobs running around, adds harassing everyone, near total chaos with most fights, the healer threatening to quit with 2 bosses left, grumbling in the group, etc. it was a mess but somehow we pulled it off. plot twist: i was the tank. this story began in guild chat, where somebody (the healer) asked for a tank. their group was at the goblin workshop area, and needed somebody to fill in so they could continue. i was on my warrior alt, wanted to try out tanking, am familiar with deadmines, so it sounded like the perfect chance. i responded, joined the party, made my way to the dungeon and met up with everyone soon enough. i wasn’t sure the circumstances behind the group missing their tank halfway through, but it didn’t matter really. the group was me (tank), a priest healer, two hunters, and a rogue. to sum up basically every fight: i could keep aggro on 1.5 mobs on average. that is, half the time, just one, the other half the time, two. three or more was too much for me apparently. i was cycling through mobs, using taunt, revenge, sunder armor, etc. as my rage allowed, and still had trouble. one thing i was bad at was situational awareness – i was so focused on the one or two right in front of me, i didn’t notice that the healer was under attack. after mr. smite, the group started offering advice. one of the hunters seemed very knowledgeable about warriors – i imagine his main was a warrior and the hunter was an alt – and suggested i switch stances, using battle stance at the start of the fight, so i could charge in and start with 10+ rage. then, switch to defensive stance so i could taunt. he then went on to mention using a macro to do it. they mentioned tanking got better at level 40, when warriors get plate mail, and said to search for videos about warrior tanking. ok, but i can’t do that during the run! so, the healer died twice by the time we at the top of the boat. and since nobody else could res, the healer had to run from the graveyard back to the entrance, while we also went to the entrance from the dungeon side to help clear the way of respawns. for those unfamiliar with deadmines, at that point (top of the boat) were 2 major bosses left: captain greenskin, and van cleef. after the we got back to this spot from the 2nd time the healer died and had to run back, they said they were leaving if they died again. i’d like to think i played better those last two fights, but it looked like the same chaos to me, and i struggled to keep 2 mobs under control. perhaps the healer’s threat focused the dps to concentrate on anything i wasn’t handling that was attacking the healer. we did prevail, but i didn’t enjoy it at all. it was more a sigh that we were done and not excitement of rolling on loot. it was pretty stressful! i decided after to concentrate on my priest, where i’m having way more fun. i feel like i’m a better healer and have had players mention that. maybe they say that all the time as a general thanks. 😉 tanking is brutal. one problem is there just isn’t a good way to practice without a group of live players, who may not know or want to be a lab experiment for somebody who needs practice. tanks also need to know the dungeon pretty well, to lead the group. plus call/mark targets, and have enough situational awareness to simultaneously cycle targets, watch for adds, check on the group to notice if someone is being attacked by an uncontrolled mob. i felt like i was juggling 2 balls, except if that’s all you can do, nobody thinks you are a juggler. after healing more instances and paying extra attention to what those tanks do, i can see one major error on my part was gathering aggro far too close to the group. i see tanks run far ahead to attack a group, while the rest of the players then come up and join in. when i tanked i was aggroing just barely in front, basically with everybody in range of every mob. and of course those better tanks pay attention – if i draw aggro the first thing i’ll cast is fade (remove threat for 10s) and stand still, continuing to heal – and in every case, the tank is already running over and grab the mob off me anyway. as a tank, i can’t rely on the priest casting fade (it does have a cooldown) so i would need to be paying enough attention to notice this unfolding. other ways to improve would be cycling attacks better, making macros to help the stance switching, etc. but i am loathe to do any of this. i’d rather work on leveling my priest. hats off to the tanks of the game, i found it to be very difficult and they are key to any group being able to do the content! author mmojugglerposted on 2019/11/172019/11/18categories wowleave a comment on wow – terrible tank lotro – new server i’ve been in a training class with coworkers from different departments, people i didn’t know before. during breaks the group discussion varies all over, and earlier this week the topic of gaming came up. console gaming, pc gaming, what genres people liked… i half paid attention since i was going over some notes from the lecture, when the conversation shifted to mmos. i perked up a bit, paying more attention. one coworker mentioned the only mmo he played was lotro. hearing that shocked me a bit – from the perspective that i’ve never met another lotro player “in the wild”! i’ve played with friends i’ve met in other games (guild wars, then we started lotro around the same time), talked a friend from other games into playing lotro (from wow, but he stopped playing both after a few months; however ~5 years ago he popped up in gw2 and we played together for a bit before stopping again), and met eve online players at work (two different people), but this is the first lotro player i’ve met. later, we talked more and i learned he plays on arkenstone, has a small kinship of friends/family, and said if i ever wanted to join, just send a message. he probably thought i wouldn’t want to leave landroval and restart… except i actually am willing to do that, in order to play with someone i know in real life. i don’t expect him to start a new char or anything, and don’t mind soloing quite a bit either, but it would be great to adventure with others occasionally! the kinship i’m in on landroval is basically defunct; it seems i’m the only semi-active player. i could have usurped the kin leadership a dozen times by now, but haven’t. anyway, i logged into arkenstone and created a beorning, since i was enjoying the one i started on anor and then the one i started when i returned to landroval. this morning, he brought it up, asking if i was interested in playing/joining on arkenstone. i got his character name and this evening, logged in and played my new beorning to level 9. this wasn’t too difficult since beornings come out of their intro area at level 5, so i quested a bit in archet and combe before mailing him and logging off. now i’m mulling over some other character possibilities. see, i haven’t purchased minas morgul expansion yet, and when i do i’ll get a version that includes a character boost. so while i am leveling away, i will make an end-game character to join in whatever i can. i figured the character i’ll boost will be a minstrel, since i do enjoy healing and groups usually are looking for that role. and then maybe make a burglar to fiddle around with… ah yes, can’t stop playing alts. author mmojugglerposted on 2019/11/072019/11/08categories lotroleave a comment on lotro – new server wow – resub i have gamer’s add but managed to get things under control… until last week when a friend told me she and two others had resubbed to wow and rolled on a classic server. having low will power and also a strong desire to play with friends, i also resubbed so all my careful plans to rotate games, etc. are tossed out the window. but this is a good thing! i might like eso, lotro, ff14 better than wow, but wow has one untouchable advantage – real life friends that play. and that is a huge draw. so, i found myself at the character creation screen of the westfall server, and soon after had a druid, paladin, and priest ready for adventure. i picked the druid and paladin because they can fill multiple roles, and i like characters that can do more than just dps. i like healing in general so those classes were natural draws as well. i plan to focus on druid and priest, with the paladin as a distant priority, since they are kinda boring to level. over in retail, i peeked at my monk, who i left off at level 100 when i subbed previously (warlords of draenor era). logging in produced a flurry of popups (garrison mission complete! new quest available! unspent talent points!) i quickly logged off, resolved to deal with all that stuff at a later time. anyway, we’ve grouped a few times now. once as lowbies in the gnome starter area, questing along to about level 7 or 8, and then a week later with all four of us, questing through westfall, planning out our eventual deadmines trip. it was a ton of fun in our group (warrior, paladin, hunter, priest) tackling westfall. i hope we can keep the momentum and avoid burnout while leveling along to 60. i do have a backup plan in case something happens – wow retail. it turns out my friends from work still play on earthen ring, so i can join with them too. towards that end, while i’ve been concentrating on classic, i did put a tiny bit of time into retail. when i resubbed, i got a free level 100 character boost. my monk, which i did enjoy, was already level 100 so i decided to boost my paladin to 100. then, when i bought the bfa expansion, i got a free level 110 character boost! that went to my druid. i figured what the heck, i’ll have a choice of 3 viable characters to play on retail if it comes to that. i haven’t completed the “welcome to your boosted character” intro on my retail paladin or retail druid yet, but i will when i have the itch to play but don’t want to do classic. perhaps i can devote some time to leveling any of my retail characters to 120 to join the end game with my old guild. back in classic – we had a few wipes due to being caught by respawn. moonbrook was surprisingly busy, with many characters waiting for defias to spawn. one minute, crowded with players and no defias, next minute the players are gone and all the defias respawn… to help keep track of each other, we assigned symbols. good times! author mmojugglerposted on 2019/10/072019/10/07categories wowleave a comment on wow – resub posts navigation page 1 page 2 … page 61
