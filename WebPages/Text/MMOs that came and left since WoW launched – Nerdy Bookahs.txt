partly that it’s not around anymore and partly because of how bad the game had been handled. it had so much potential, but the players didn’t have powerful enough pcs at the time and the servers couldn’t handle it either. i know that by now, neither seems to be a big issue anymore, because thankfully, there is a private server around nowadays. if they decided to give us war 2.0, i would definitely jump in without hesitation… okay, a little bit of hesitation and i wouldn’t give them a 6 month subscription immediately. but i would be interested! for me, it’s been the best open world pvp experience i have ever had. yes, i know there are lots of voices calling for 3 factions instead of 2 fighting against each other and i agree. what i mean with the best experience is that i usually stay far away from open world pvp, but in warhammer, only parts of each zone were contested and you could be in the non-contested parts, watch the chat, figure out where in the pvp part you’d be needed and just jump in for as long as you wanted to. hello kitty online now, in my defense: a former colleague loved hello kitty and when i saw that it has an mmo, i had to give it a try and tell her about it. so that’s also how the blog post about the game came to be. this isn’t an mmo i would have ever played seriously, but it was fun to try and write about it. wildstar another game where i’m really upset that it doesn’t exist anymore. i loved wildstar! for some time, i had a subscription before it went free to play. then i continued playing it, but i left after a while. this, just as vanguard, seemed like a game that wouldn’t get more updates which always kept me from going back to the game 100 %. i did enjoy my time and would wish it came back online again, with active development, preferrably. also, i really loved their take on the christmas in-game holiday. everquest next / landmark they listed everquest next and landmark as two separate games, i think. for me, it’s both the same. we never got to step a foot into everquest next. landmark was originally just meant to be a sandbox tool to create and build things in. then at some point, they changed their mind and tried to make it a real game. but i was always confused about the direction they were going and what exactly their plans were with landmark. as far as everquest next is concerned, i never liked the graphic design. it was fine for landmark. it just didn’t feel right for the successor to everquest i and ii. that is 8 out of 25 mmos. not bad. i’ve known about more than these eight, but i wasn’t interested in even trying them out (for whatever reason – see hello kitty). the list is probably not listing all mmos. for example, it’s lacking fallen earth which only closed down recently.
