the new kliin dish cleansing paste saves water and will last about 6 months. simply wipe some on your cloth and wash. it doesn’t hurt that the lime smells great too! what i was also impressed with was that it is really a great cleaner! i had to scrub something that i thought was going to be way trickier than it ended up being and this paste really helped! to get more information about kliin, find them online at www.kliin.co instagram: @kliinco facebook: @kliinco enter to win interested in winning your own kliin set with the dish paste and reusable cloths?
