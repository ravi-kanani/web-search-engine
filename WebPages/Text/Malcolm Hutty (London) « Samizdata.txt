malcolm hutty (london) · transport the royal mail is to sell off the post office underground railway, better known as mail rail. for the uninitiated, this is basically the crossrail project (the east-west rail link across london that is as eagerly anticipated by commuters as it is delayed by politicians and dreaded by taxpayers). the only differences: it exists in reality, not just as a gleam in john prescott’s eye, and it only carries sacks of mail. millions of them per day. like crossrail, however, it is too expensive – the post office says it is simply not economic to run any more. the times [to which samizdata does not link], asks in today’s leader for ideas on what use may be put to such a railway, bearing in mind it is only tall enough to carry passengers if they lie down like guests in a japanese capsule hotel. surely the collective ingenuity of samizdata can come up with some good ideas? here’s two to start the ball rolling: cross-london packet sevice. surely it could continue in its present role if anyone – private individual, corporation, courier or freight company – could use it. modern barcode technology could make it easy to identify the right packet to serve up at the receiving station. mail rail is infrastructure; if the post office opened their pipes to competing “content”, like telcos and isps do, then perhaps the infrastructure would be viable, and even extended? the real crossrail. wouldn’t it be cheaper to widen a tunnel that already exists than to build a new one? everyone knows that crossrail is desperately needed if london is not to sieze up – and risk losing companies migrating elsewhere to restore the balance. everyone also knows that the £4bn estimate is likely to be spent several times over before the system goes into service – these projects always overrun. isn’t this a good opportunity to cut costs? the usual prize (kudos, not cash) for the most innovative suggestion. may 23rd, 2003 | 9 comments - (comments are closed) samizdata quote of the day malcolm hutty (london) · european union · slogans & quotations a referendum on joining the euro will cause “all-out internal civil war” – dennis mcshane, minister for europe i never referred to… [civil war] in the labour party. calling for a referendum… would launch a long civil war in the uk with everyone fighting everyone. – dennis mcshane, minister for europe, subsequent clarification.

at the moment us troops have that special diplomatic immunity that comes from firing big guns. but when things settle down a little, will they be subject to iraqi law? will there be a semi-permanent us forces base established in iraq, under us jurisdiction? will general garner, the designated head of orha, be answerable to the iraqi head of an iraqi interim authority, or will it be the other way around? most of all, will orha have a free reign to root out ba’athists and stamp on ongoing corruption? → continue reading: flying the flag, part 2 april 11th, 2003 | 11 comments - (comments are closed) flying the flag malcolm hutty (london) · middle east & islamic egged on by their bbc interviewers, a number of pundits and iraqi exiles have been criticising the use of the american flag as an “execution hood” over the statute of saddam. it was “inappropriate” and it “should not have been done”. voiceover commentary on news 24, as i type this article, added “better judgement prevailed and the flag was removed”. to me, there seem to be three immediately obvious polite answers to such criticism: the iraqi crowd cheered when the us flag was raised. rageh omah, bbc reporter on the spot, could not hear the sonorous commentary in the studio, and made the possibly career-limiting mistake of answering the question “how is the crowd reacting to the american flag?” with the simple truth. this answer has obviously not been repeated in evening bulletins. the u.s. flag was raised by an over-exuberant marine, and removed within minutes when seen by a commanding officer. this was no indicator of imperialist policy, quite the opposite. conquering armies rape and pillage, the americans leant the use of their m-88 armored recovery vehicle to a celebrating crowd. the flag was not raised over a public building or other centre of power. it was attached to a symbol of the old regime that was about to be destroyed. if you insist on reading undue symbolism into this, then the message would be not “america rules the roost now” but “america delivered you from the tyrant whose statue you are destroying”. but the overwhelmingly obvious response is not so polite: i’m just glad the iraqi people in the street aren’t such ungrateful sobs! april 10th, 2003 | 39 comments - (comments are closed) who are we?
