we covered that. curious about heather's gut? we covered that, too. we also talk a bit about mail, resolutions, teens (ugh teens), organization, and meditation. like we said before: same mrs, just a little less often. episode 159 // change is afoot november 14, 2019 get it? a foot? because heather's foot? perfect. now that you're smiling about that we can let you know that you're going to be hearing from us less often. a lot less often. as in only once a month. why? there are a lot of reasons, but "life" is probably the best summary. episode 158 // fun with fur and feet november 14, 2019 we never know where we’re going or how we get there, but maybe that’s part of the charm? anyway, heather’s getting some answers, john’s a furminator convert, and marlo is marlo (which is somehow also very lexton). also: dog socks. episode 157 // we call it hygge october 24, 2019 what does laundry share in common with cold, leftover nachos? comfort. yes, cold nachos provide comfort and we’re ready to die on this hill. sure, we are open to other opinions, but you know what they say: it’s not a difference of opinion, you’re just ill-informed. episode 156 // reddit for relationships october 24, 2019 we talk about more than bumble (you know you want an update), but john’s text to heather is probably the best description for this episode. “without fail, the women on this app are in three distinct categories: 1. want kids, 2. don’t want a relationship, 3. way out of my league. however, even if nothing in their bio is a fit, i always swipe right on the women who look like they could kick my a$$.” episode 155 // a dating app newcomer october 24, 2019 it finally happened. john joined the online dating scene and it’s as confusing and empty as he’s always imagined. it has, however, made him realize how many people are terrible at taking selfies. but don’t worry, mrs’s resident optimist is staying hopeful. just kidding! all is lost. episode 154 // the price of a pet october 07, 2019 an update on coco (a pupdate?), some commentary on halloween, and a discussion on how much our pets are worth. what's that? we're heartless and evil? yeah, okay, probably, but that should have been clear years ago. and don't worry, we take a softer approach when discussing orthodontics and swimming. episode 153 // canines and curriculum october 07, 2019 we moved right from elizabethan collars into pop punk- and it wasn’t a smooth transition. that’s john’s fault. but somehow we still managed to cover homeschool curriculum, the climate, and a bit about vaccinations. if this seems chaotic, you should see our texts. episode 152 // fitted and folded september 19, 2019 sure, we took a week off due to both of us being sick, but we didn’t actually get a week off. there were endoscopies to be had, sheets to be folded, and puppies to be chased. and this weed won’t just eat itself. episode 151 // injury and insult september 17, 2019 it’s been a busy week without any travel or big changes. how so? well, heather’s foot is still an issue, her gi tract is making waves, and john’s battling school policy. oh yeah, there was also an incident with a gun at leta’s school. don't worry, it’s not all somber and sad. episode 150 // boots and bowels september 17, 2019 somehow this episode came full circle. from boots and bus stops to pets and school routines, we cover a lot and bookend the whole thing with bowels. sometimes we even surprise ourselves, but not as much as leta will surprise herself when she finally understands that a car does not steer itself. episode 149 // don’t forget to steer august 22, 2019 another week, another couple dozen lessons in stress management. but we’re still taking our own advice and letting things slide. invasive dogs, oversleeping teens, and even the thought of complete obliviousness behind the wheel of a large metal box hurtling at other objects. one of these days the dogs are definitely going to make us snap though. episode 148 // slow down august 22, 2019 weird title for a show called "manic rambling spiral," but here we are. heather ditched her fitbit and her apple watch and, as a result, a whole lot of anxiety, so this week is focused (eventually) on slowing down, taking things in stride, and some very relevant advice from an englishman in a dutch bar. and yes, mrs is back from break. 147 // from paris to puppies august 22, 2019 socialized medicine doesn’t disappoint, especially when the phenomenon of “hot doctor” clearly exists in all countries. but john’s doctor? nah. he prefers the shotgun approach. and yes, we also talk about lilly. 146 // friends and fashion august 22, 2019 john and heather are both facing some child-free time, and it’s going to be glorious. we bask in that notion, discuss friendships as an adult, and even touch on heather’s questionable fashion decisions. we’d say everything is related, but that probably isn’t true. episode 145 // no topic needed august 22, 2019 we had a meetup last week! it was great. to say "thank you!" to everyone who joined us, we spent most of this episode talking about healthcare. that wasn't really the plan, but that's how things go around here. we also touched on john's dog, the woes of air travel, and a couple apologies related to ep 144. episode 144 // reunited at last august 22, 2019 we got the band back together. well, the band never really broke up, but heather and john are in the same (hotel) room recording mrs for the first time ever and we’re talking about chicago and homelessness and also teeth. it was easy. mostly. a little awkward because we also recorded a video. so, yeah, that’s a thing. prev / next manic rambling spiral manic rambling spiral (mrs) is a podcast about single parenting but it's not a parenting podcast. rather, mrs is a podcast about living life - having a life, a career, and a self - in a setting that is constantly dictated by, built around and sabotaged by our children. we will always be thankful for the help we received from canidae® when launching this project. ©2018 hba media, inc. featured mar 19, 2020 163 // come on eileen mar 19, 2020 mar 19, 2020 mar 16, 2020 162 // mrs turns 4 mar 16, 2020 mar 16, 2020 jan 30, 2020 161 // in memory of coco jan 30, 2020 jan 30, 2020 jan 30, 2020 episode 160 // out with the old jan 30, 2020 jan 30, 2020
