rating: reviewers: tommy (daddy) leyla (mummy) aron (8 years old) aidan (7 years old) what’s in march 2019’s degustabox? motherhood diaries unboxing this month’s degustabox below: products kind snacks dark chocolate nuts & sea salt – £1.35 “there’s tasty. there’s nutritious. then there’s tasty & nutritious. kind believe you deserve both. our bars are just whole nuts bound together with honey, and we don’t skimp on the good stuff; they are crafted with up to 72% nuts. plus they’re all gluten-free & naturally high in protein! available in all major supermarket chains.” our opinion – this kind bar was absolutely delicious – so delicious i was gutted the experience was over in just a few bites. i would definitely get this bar again, it is so tasty while being healthy too! it’s also dairy free! send me more please kind!!! 5/5 view this post on instagram omg, delicious! already gone through most of the chocolate in this month’s @degustabox_uk, but this @kindsnacksuk chocolate is ridiculously good! i would suggest you order this month’s degusta box as this is not the only sweet treat you receive! hint @greenandblacks 😋😋😋😋 #gifted #delicious #decadent #sweet #sweettreats a post shared by leyla preston (@motherhooddiaries) on mar 20, 2019 at 5:27am pdt forest feast preda fair trade mango 30g & milk chocolate mango & coconut fruit balls 30g – £1.29 “our award-winning forest feast, exotic preda dried mango, sourced solely from the preda fair trade organisation in the philippines and enjoy our soft, bite-sized balls of exotic dried mango blended with tropical coconut and covered in creamy belgian milk chocolate. a little bit of indulgence with less of the guilt. you should receive both products in your box. forest feast also retail 100g packs at £3. preda mango is retailed at waitrose, tesco and ocado; milk chocolate fruit balls is retailed at waitrose and ocado.” our opinion – more delicious healthy sweet snacks in this month’s degustabox – i feel spoiled! the dried mango was surprisingly sweet and very tasty. the boys really enjoyed it too. but the milk chocolate covered fruit balls were out of this world! i couldn’t stop eating them that i had to tell the boys to take them away from me so they could get a chance to eat them too. definitely, a great way to cover fruit, especially with the gorgeous mango and coconut flavour! 5/5 moose juice passion fruit 250ml – £1.59 “moose juice is your delicious zero sugar aspartame free energy drink with added bcaas and b vitamins. when you need extra energy and focus without the crash, get a boost from the moose! available at holland & barrett and selected sainsbury’s stores.” our opinion – i only had a sip of this energy drink, but my husband slurped the entire drink in a few seconds and said that it was one of the best-tasting energy drinks he had tried for ages – so sounds like a win/win to me! 5/5 weetabix on the go strawberry – £1.49 “add a fruity twist to your smooth start with a refreshing bottle of weetabix on the go strawberry. our delicious breakfast drink squeezes loads of energy (from the iron), fibre and protein into a convenient, grab-and-go bottle. take hold of your morning and have a proper breakfast, bottled. available in all major supermarket chains.” our opinion – again, i only managed a sip of this drink before my husband swiftly grabbed it from my hands and took it to work. it has a lovely sweet strawberry taste, and my husband said it did fill him up in the morning. but he reckons nothing can beat weetabix with milk and strawberries on it. this drink is a good idea for when you missed breakfast and need something to keep you going at least until brunch. 4/5 willie’s cacao single estate chocolate – £1.99 “close your eyes, let the chocolate melt, and for a few minutes of pure pleasure enjoy the long-forgotten flavours of the world’s great single estate cacaos. to preserve these delicate flavours, we use only natural ingredients and make everything ourselves from ‘bean to bar’. pure flavours. pure pleasure. available at sainsbury, waitrose, ocado, café nero, whsmith. you should receive one of four flavours in your box. available at sainsbury’s, waitrose, ocado, café nero, whsmith.” our opinion – fruity chocolate is fast becoming my favourite kind of chocolate especially when the chocolate is as rich and decadent as willie’s cacao chocolate. you can taste the authentic flavours and the sweetness of passion fruit coming through. at first, i thought this chocolate was for melting into hot water or milk as it is one big round circular block of chocolate. but, then i realised, nope, you just stick the chocolate in your mouth and let it melt away – delicious! 5/5 costa signature blend coffee ground for cafetiere & filter “at costa coffee, we know great coffee. the proof? we’ve been serving our legendary signature blend since ’71. now you can enjoy the home of great coffee, in your home. try costa’s, medium strength, signature blend roasted and ground coffee for cafetiere and filter. available in all major supermarkets.” our opinion – unfortunately, we were unable to try this coffee for several reasons. first i quit coffee five months ago and have not looked back. second, we don’t have a cafetiere or a filter machine. we do have a coffee machine, but the ground component is broken. so we gave this coffee to a friend and hope that she liked it. so, unfortunately, we can’t rate it. i bet it’s good though! chum fruit bites apple/strawberry – £0.79 “100% wild. no fake stuff! 100% fruit, vegan, high in fibre, kosher and gluten-free. nothing artificial, no preservatives nor concentrates. all the goodness of real fruit slowly baked into our magical fruit bites. and we give back 15% of profits to help save our endangered chums with wildaid.org. available at www.chumbites.com. you should receive two flavours in your box.” our opinion – manufacturers who make 100% fruit, vegan, kosher and gluten-free products and then don’t stop there, by giving back to our animal friends deserve a full five out of five from the get-go! and, you know what? their deliciousness match the goodness of chum too! sweet but not sugary sweet. you can really taste the strawberry and apple coming through, and i would have no hesitation offering my boys these kinds of snacks, especially when i know buying them will help the animals too! 5/5 jubel alpine beer cut with peach – £1.80 “inspired by a dangerously refreshing beer secret we discovered in the alps, alpine combines a lively lager with the zest of fresh ripe peaches. naturally infused, gluten-free and vegan – now available nationwide in sainsbury’s. find your nearest store at www.jubelbeer.com.” our opinion – i don’t drink alcohol at the moment, so hubby got to try this lager. he said it had a lovely peach taste to it, but he had nothing else to say as it tasted like beer. and, hubby likes beer, so i’m going to assume that meant he like this one! 4.5/5 green & black’s praline & truffle bars – £0.89 “discover a moment of indulgence with green & black’s truffle and praline bars. breakthrough the smooth dark chocolate shell to reveal the delicious truffle and praline centres. the perfect way to treat yourself. made with ethically sourced chocolate and no artificial flavours, colours or preservatives. you should receive both flavours in your box. available in tesco, sainsbury’s, waitrose, morrisons, co-op, superdrug & whsmith” our opinion – i love green & black’s, and i knew i’d love these truffle and praline bars. i would say the milk & hazelnut was better because it was slightly sweeter, but i’m a huge dark chocolate fan, so either was delicious for me. the boys were not as keen, but that was because they were dark chocolate and they were expecting a much more sweet taste. oh well, more for me! 4/5 red red super stews black eyed beans & tomato/red beans & sweet potato – £2.99 “inspired by africa and remixed by london, red red super stews were developed in partnership with celebrated chef zoe adjonyoh from zoe’s ghana kitchen, a pop-up in brixton. our delicious stews are made with natural, plant-based ingredients – think okra, lentils, red beans and sweet potato, to name a few. you should receive one of two flavours in your box. available at whole foods & selected sainsbury’s stores.” our opinion – i love black eyed beans (well any beans really) and i love tomato-based food, so i thought i’d like this super stew – and i did! this stew has a real zing to it, and i loved that. it’s excellent with a piece of bread and when you need to eat something but can’t be bothered to make anything, then this stew is perfect. really delicious. i’d love to try the other version too! 4/5 ballymaloe original relish – free gift “ballymaloe original relish is rich in tomatoes, delicious and incredibly versatile. it is excellent with beef burgers, french fries, cold meats, cheese, sausage rolls and salads./ it is also wondering ul in sandwiches or served with light meals, picnics or barbecues. ballymaloe original relish is made using all-natural ingredients, gluten free and is also suitable for vegans.” our opinion – i love relish, especially with cheese and crackers and as i’m plant based now i had to find another way to enjoy this relish. easy! this relish is so delicious that i even added it to my spaghetti sauce and it really enhanced the flavour. i will definitely be getting a larger version! plus, the relish was free in this month’s degusta box! 5/5 what did i like most about march 2019’s degusta box? we have a very fruity theme going on in this month’s degusta box – and i absolutely loved it! this is the kind of thing i was hoping for with degusta box, and i really like the direction that degusta box are going, i.e. vegan, gluten free, dairy free, healthy alternatives. it was hard to pick a favourite, but the kind snack, the forest feast fruit balls and the chum fruit bites stand out the most for me. willie’s cacao too… and ballymaloe’s original relish was delish… ah, selection headache! rating: 5 out of 5 – easily one of the best degusta boxes i’ve tried so far – i’m sure there’s more deliciousness to come! leyla preston (594 posts) leyla preston is the owner and editor of motherhood diaries global magazine for parents. leyla is a busy mother of two even busier boys; aron, 8, and aidan, 7. when leyla isn’t feeding, managing a gazillion tasks or cleaning the infinite mess at home, she is busy working on this magazine and a new cooking channel coming very soon – no rest for the wicked!you can follow leyla on twitter (@m_diaries) or join the busy motherhood diaries facebook group where all mums get together and share stories and solutions with one another: https://www.facebook.com//groups/motherhooddiaries/ tags:degusta boxfood and drinkmarch 2019 related posts recipe – snowcapped chocolate fond... may picnic 2017 degustabox review october 2014 – degustabox product review... february 2020 degusta box review – easte... may 2019 brunch and afternoon tea degust... november 2017 degustabox review august 2016 degustabox review november 2016 (christmas) degustabox rev... graze sharing boxes – a review june 2019 summer and bbq degusta box rev... chillfactor squeeze cup slushy maker ... june 2015 – picnic degustabox product re... motherhood diaries bakes with betty croc... april 2014 – degustabox product re... december 2017 degustabox review oxo good grips 3-piece berries bowl ... how to make the most of the blackberry s... june 2017 bbq degustabox review superfood christmas tree salad – the big... december 2018 degustabox review christmas spiced apple and walnut chutne... july 2019 picnic degusta box review about motherhood diaries leyla preston is founder of motherhood diaries and a busy mum of two boys aged 7 and 9 years old and a 4-month-old baby girl! sign up to become an md contributor here find out more about motherhood diaries here tv and radio contributor subscribe for full access to our free resource library now! awesome, thanks so much! there's an email coming your way :-) there was an error submitting your subscription. please try again. email address i'd like to receive the free email course. i'm ready! please follow & like us :) food advertising by category index category index select categoryanimals and pets (5)arts and crafts (9)birth stories (18) caesarean birth stories (3) home birth (4) natural birth stories (2) vaginal birth after caesarean (vbac) (1)birthday parties and celebrations (9)blog (56) first trimester (9) my motherhood (3) my pregnancy (38) second trimester (14) third trimester (15)breastfeeding (9)campaigns and charities (12)christmas (16)cleaning (4)competition/giveaways (25)cryptic pregnancies (2)daddies (6)education (26)elderly (1)environment (4)events (30)family health (119)fashion (27)food and drink (103)front page (41)get outdoors!
