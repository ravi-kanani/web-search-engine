petite anglaise march 30, 2006 bloggerers' social – update filed under: good time girl — petiteanglaiseparis @ 11:02 am just a little note to say that if anyone who dropped me a line to say they wanted to come along on saturday 1st april has not received the meet up details by email, due to my poor dizzy blonde head being all spinny and full of interest rates, please drop me another line on petite.anglaise@gmail.com and i will forward you the info. comments (14) march 26, 2006 things i will really miss… filed under: city of light — petiteanglaiseparis @ 8:26 pm …if the offer goes through on my belleville 2 pièces. *sigh* update: it has gone through. ohmygod! i’m officially stressed now at the prospect of having to woo banks and look at reams of paperwork. if any kind reader can recommend a good courtier based in central paris i would love to hear from you!!! comments (68) march 23, 2006 monday filed under: working girl — petiteanglaiseparis @ 4:22 pm “now, about monday…” my boss continues. i have no idea what is supposed to be happening on monday. what haven’t i organised? whose hotel haven’t i booked? “monday… now, let me see…” i reply, in the calmest, most in control super secretary voice i can muster, while hastily opening his calendar in outlook to see what i’ve missed. the computer responds at a leisurely pace, mired in the middle of some pesky spysweeper scan. “oh, you’re breaking up, can you hear me? hello? hello?” i improvise, praying that he is not, in fact, calling from a landline. and then the window pops up and i notice “[petite] off” on monday 27 march 2006. “ooh! i’m on holiday! i’d forgotten! what a lovely surprise!” i cry, unable to curb my enthusiasm. miss moneypenny would never have lost her composure like that. i have a lot to learn. i can almost hear in my boss’s silence his chagrin at having reminded me of my forgotten holiday. there is a good chance that had he not, i would have appeared at 9.07 am sharp, none the wiser, and done a full day’s work. so. my question is, what shall i do with this day of freedom, which has fallen unexpectedly out of the sky and into my lap? suggestions in my comments box please. preferably inexpensive ones, as the end of the month is approaching. comments (68) march 22, 2006 lost and found filed under: tadpole rearing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:33 pm the door to mr frog’s apartment is ajar, so i venture in. the cosy scene which greets me is of tadpole, seated on the sofa, cheeks a fiery shade of crimson, watching her favourite “oui oui” dvd. in stark contrast, mr frog, slumped by her side, is an exhausted shade of grey. tadpole has been suffering from a particularly nasty cold and tummy upset virus (a french doctor would no doubt refer to this as “gastric flu”, making it sound emergency ward, code red serious) which has been doing the rounds in paris of late. mr frog, due to unfortunate timing, has borne the brunt of the horrorshow nappies and sleepless nights, while i galavant around paris, full of the joys of spring. i take a seat beside tadpole, while mr frog pours me a glass of coffee flavoured coca cola (not bad, but not exactly good either, whatever will they dream up next?) to taste. we chat, mostly swapping favourite tadpole anecdotes, and recounting flat hunting experiences, until he recalls something she had told him the previous day which made a lasting impression. they were looking at the letters of the alphabet depicted on her coloured jigsaw floor tiles, and tadpole had seized upon the letter “j”. “it’s a j for jim,” she announced, proudly. “oh yes,” replied mr frog, uneasily, wondering what to say next. “maman, elle a perdu son ami jim, et elle pleure,” added my daughter. “when was she crying?” mr frog enquired, concerned. “yesterday,” came the reply. i am amazed. she has not mentioned his name once, not since that first horrible day when she knocked on the door, expecting him to answer. i truly thought she had already forgotten him. i hasten to reassure mr frog that by yesterday, tadpole actually means two whole weeks ago. because, actually, after shedding a thousand tears during that first weekend of disbelief, i haven’t cried since. not once. there are moments when i fall victim to feelings of overwhelming panic about the prospect of being alone. moments when i experience little pangs of regret about the plans i have been forced to cast aside. but on the whole, i’m surprised to find that i feel little remorse about this aborted relationship. the future beckons, pregnant with promise. and i walk slowly towards it, with only the slightest hesitation, and not so much as a backward glance. comments (28) older posts » search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
