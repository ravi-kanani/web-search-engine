petite anglaise march 31, 2008 special k filed under: tadpole rearing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:22 am ‘we’re making a “k” for “kite”,’ says tadpole, her voice a half-yawn. this would be true if her bed wasn’t an extra short lit évolutif from ikea, which i really should lengthen one day soon, as tadpole is tall and willowly. my (shorter, stumpier – do i sound jealous yet?) legs are currently bent at the knee, so even if she is lying in a sort of sideways ‘v’ shape, with her bottom nestling against my tummy, we’re making a special sort of k. with a tail. i glance at the miffy wall clock, which reads 7.43. almost half-time. my morning routine (on weekdays) goes something like this: 7.15: alarm clock sounds. it’s actually the alarm on my landline phone, and whenever i’m in a shop or restaurant that uses the same ringtone, it sends icicles down my spine. 7.20: i press snooze. 7.25: i press snooze. 7.30: i press stop. 7.32: i get up, walk along the corridor, raise the blackout blinds in tadpole’s room, then climb into her bed. 7.32 – 8.02: we snuggle. she tells me what she has been dreaming about. or i guess. it can be one of four things: mermaids, princesses, fairies or unicorns, so the odds are not exactly stacked against me. 8.02 – 8.25: she eats cereal, we get dressed, i drink my first cloonette of the day. 8.25: we run to school, slipping inside just before the doors close, at 8.30. i realise that this may not seem like the best time management policy, but try as i might, i can’t bring myself to change any of the above. ‘so, what did you dream about today?’ i ask, my voice muffled by her curls, which are also tickling my nose. ‘i did dream that i was a princess, in a castle,’ tadpole begins. so far, so predictable. ‘and you were the queen, mummy… and grandma was the maid…’ chuckling, i make a mental note to tell my mother about her demotion to the servants’ quarters. i wonder whether granddad made an appearance in tadpole’s dream, perhaps as the court jester, but wisely hold my tongue. we will be visiting england in a few weeks’ time and tadpole can always be relied upon to repeat precisely those phrases she shouldn’t. (‘mummy says i shouldn’t eat my spaghettis like that because i’m not a piggy like you.’ ouch.) but there is to be no mention of granddad. instead, tadpole swivels around so that she is facing me and we (almost) form a triangle. ‘in my dream,’ she says, looking at me intently, ‘my daddy was the king and he did live in the same castle as us.’ ‘did he now?’ i say, reflecting that although my daughter may not look much like me, we’ve both inherited the recessive subtlety gene. ‘but mummy already has a king, doesn’t she? and she can’t have two… i mean, i’ve never seen a castle with two kings in it, have you?’ tadpole shakes her head, seemingly satisfied with my explanation. i glance back at the miffy clock. it is only 7.53, but i decide to make breakfast early. ‘so,’ i enquire, ‘did the princess in your dream eat special k with chocolate pieces in for her breakfast?’ comments (40) march 25, 2008 madame bovary on the métro… filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 12:26 pm petite anglaise garnered a couple more (rather tardy) reviews in the british press this weekend. the first was in the independent, last friday, and gave me cause to wonder whether i shouldn’t have reinvented mr frog as a non smoker or extolled the virtues of lipton yellow tea in the interests of avoiding clichéd representations of the french. the second, in the weekend edition of the ft, references madame bovary (on the métro to the childminder’s). i really liked this piece – the reviewer seemed to really “get” the book. and of course i drew no small amount of satisfaction from remembering that my former employer not only subscribed to the ft, but displayed it prominently on the glass coffee table in reception… comments (55) march 21, 2008 thanks! filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:45 am i’d like to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone who turned out (in the freezing cold) to listen to me read at wh smiths last night. it was somewhat unnerving giving a reading in front of so many people (120! wow!) but i ended up thoroughly enjoying myself and i’m eternally grateful to you all for laughing in the right places. for those who couldn’t make it, i signed a sizeable stack of copies before i left and these may be procured from wh smiths at your leisure (and possibly posted to you if you live elsewhere in france). sadly, my camera was on the blink and i’m gutted i forgot to ask the boy to bring his and play the role of official snapper. but i did happen to notice a few flashbulbs going off, so if you have photographic evidence you’re willing to share, i’d love to see it. you can mail snaps to the usual address, or add photos to my facebook page. i’ll pop anything i receive up on flickr and link to it from here. and was it just my imagination, or did my accent start off bbc posh and gradually veer off in a northern direction? comments (34) march 18, 2008 reprieve filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 10:43 am it is sunday morning. after a friend’s birthday dinner at le chapeau melon the previous night and a few glasses of wine, i’m feeling sluggish. it’s been weeks since i’ve managed to sleep in. when i’m feeling stressed and highly strung i wake early, my overactive brain skittering uncontrollably from worry to worry until i can’t bear it any more and have to haul myself out of bed to escape my own thoughts. but today i’m so snug, my head’s so empty, that i just want to savour the feeling of warm bed, the back of my hand grazing the boy’s smooth buttock. the problem, of course, is that i’m supposed to be taking tadpole to her water play session (i hesitate to call it swimming class, as there is still no sign of any teaching element whatsoever). i have to go: it’s paid for, she loves it and i even made the mistake of mentioning it when i got up to make her breakfast a few hours earlier. she’s watching a dvd at present in the next room while i drift in and out of sleep, rain pattering comfortingly against the windowpane. there’s no way she will have forgotten. i hear a noise, and it takes me a while to register whether the culprit is the doorbell, the alarm clock, or one of the four mobile phones the boy and i have lying around the room. by the time i work out what is going on and have crawled across the room, a message has been left on my phone. the number is an unfamiliar land line, and i contemplate replacing phone in handbag without investigating further. then again, maybe someone somewhere has just answered my prayers. so i dial “888” and clamp the phone to my ear to listen, a smile slowly spreading across my face. ‘bonjour, je vous appelle de la piscine grange aux belles,’ says the voice. it’s the jovial lady with a poodle perm who guards the swimming pool entrance, usually armed with a large tin of assorted sweets. ‘la séance de 11h30 est annulée,’ she says breathlessly, probably making her twentieth identical call. ‘en raison d’un caca dans l’eau.’ ‘hallelujah,’ i say, glancing at the clock, which reads 11.15 am. i slip between the covers, unable to believe my good fortune. comments (67) older posts » search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com. post to cancel
