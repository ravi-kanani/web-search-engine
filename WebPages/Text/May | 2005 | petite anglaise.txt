petite anglaise may 31, 2005 malaise filed under: navel gazing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 12:10 am i’ll admit that i’m feeling weird about the act of blogging at the moment. although i’m only telling you part of the story, sharing what i want (or feel compelled) to write about, to get out of my system – all the while keeping in mind that i must respect mr frog’s absolute, unquestionable right to privacy by refraining from stringing out our dirty laundry across the internet for all to see – i still feel awkward and uncomfortable. first, there was the flood of comments and emails. lovely, supportive messages from people who admitted that no, they didn’t know me, but said they *felt* as though they did. people who said that reading “endings” caused them to shed a tear, or to think about me all weekend. that reading about mr frog and i affected them as much as hearing about a couple of close, non-virtual friends splitting up. they offered advice, a place to stay, a shoulder to cry on, or even to send me comfort food by airmail. i was touched by the warmth contained in those messages, and surprised at the emotions my words had visibly stirred up, but it remained virtual all the same. and i was painfully conscious that there was far more going on in my life than the little i was telling. so readers were making judgements without being in possession of anything like the full facts. which didn’t seem fair on mr frog, for one. the stats climbed steeply. i began to fear that i might feel tempted to exploit what was happening in my personal life for its drama potential. worried that i already had. alternately racked with guilt and childishly gleeful about the extra hits petite anglaise was getting. (i suspect there were lots of repeat visits, in any case, out of concern, to see if any more news was forthcoming). someone once asked me whether having the blog couldn’t potentially influence my actions in some way. my response was something along the lines of: “no way! read what i write and you’ll see! i write about the mundane, the trivial, the everyday. i don’t lead a fascinating life, or make myself do things in order to have something to write about…” now i am wondering. are my actions skewed by the fact that i know i may write about them afterwards? is the very fact of having a blog, and one which has always peddled the naked truth, akin to having countless cameras trained on my every move in a ‘big brother’ house, making it impossible to behave naturally, impossible to live life the way i would have before, when it wasn’t under this self-inflicted scrutiny? you may suggest that i should just blog about something else: trot out a light-hearted little piece about parisian life, or elaborate on that funny thing that tadpole did this morning. to that i would counter that it is impossible for me to do whimsical and amusing when i am wandering around in a permanent daze, i haven’t slept properly for weeks and am feeling in turn blissfully happy about the glowing new perspectives that the future seems to offer, and melancholy about this page which is being turned and the effect it will have on our little family. there is little space in my head for anything else. mr frog and i are living in limbo: we have decided to separate, but the change this has wrought remains virtual. we wake up side by side every morning, and follow the same daily routine. he comes home; i fix some pasta and ask about his day. the only outwardly visible difference is that the coffee table is littered with a-z maps and ads for 1 bedroom apartments. inside our heads, much has changed. but nothing concrete seems to reflect that yet. you may suggest that i stop blogging for a while. i won’t like it if you do, and i don’t actually know whether i can. it is a powerful addiction and i don’t know that i want to kick the habit at this point in time. i feel weird. but bear with me. i’m sure it will pass. comments (44) may 26, 2005 the end of the affair? filed under: french touch, navel gazing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 1:58 pm for today’s post, kindly follow me. and my i point out at this juncture that i categorically do not wear red nail varnish. comments (45) may 24, 2005 bisou filed under: tadpole rearing — petiteanglaiseparis @ 12:29 pm tadpole has started mothering mr frog and i. “mon petit canard,” she says tenderly, while pinching both my cheeks until my eyes water. i gather that this is meant to be an affectionate gesture. note to self: must cut her fingernails tonight after her bath. “allez, mange!” she orders, as i try to work up some enthusiasm for my breakfast cereal, despite it having the consistency of cardboard in my dry mouth. “assieds-toi là , ma puce,” she instructs in a bossy tone, before proceeding to show me the picture she has been busily scribbling on. it’s actually quite a disturbing sight, when i examine it more closely. the drawing she had begged for yesterday, with a mummy, a daddy, two little girls, a pig, a spider and an octopus, now has all the faces blackened out. i decide not to let myself dwell on any possible pseudo-psycho explanations for this and instead concentrate on complimenting the neatness of her colouring in. i know this is just a phase that she is going through, where she is showing mr frog and i the same sollicitude and affection that she showers on her favourite dolly. i am told she also takes great delight in mothering the childminder’s youngest charge at the moment, helping out at bottle time, asking her what the matter is when she cries. all seemingly perfectly natural. but at the same time, i wonder whether, despite all our efforts to put on a happy, friendly front during this awkward time while we carry on living together, until mr frog finds a place to live nearby, she is still picking up on the fact that something is going on. sensing that we both need a few extra cuddes and kisses. attuned to the emotions we are taking care to rein in when in her presence. this morning was downright spooky. as i was about to leave for work, mr frog being on tadpole dropping off duty, i bent down low to receive my goodbye kiss. mr frog was on his knees in the hallway, cramming things into his bag. tadpole grabbed both of us firmly by the arm and pulled us together. “donne bisou à daddy,” she commanded, her eyes very large and serious. i kissed him lightly on the cheek, noting that i was not the only one with tears in my eyes. comments (16) may 22, 2005 null and void filed under: navel gazing, parting ways — petiteanglaiseparis @ 10:49 pm i wish i knew how to behave. if mr frog had shouted, or cried, or lost his temper, stormed out and slammed the door behind him, i would have known how to react to that. i expected fireworks and melodrama. i felt i deserved them, somehow. here was i, stammering in a low, guilt-ridden voice that i had finally found the strength to walk away from this relationship which was not what i wanted any more. where, in my opinion, it was plain to see that we were both deeply unhappy. here was i confessing that i hadn’t come to take this decision without any outside help: there was another person involved. it’s not that i wanted to inflict pain. far from it. but some kind of reaction would have been nice. nothing. not a moan or a whimper on my account. there was genuine anguish as he grappled with the idea of having to live apart from our daughter, and possibly see her less often. there were demands for reassurance that his role as daddy would never be challenged. this was the outcome i had told myself i expected, that i had hoped for, as i rehearsed my lines earlier that evening, but i found the total absence of any emotional response in relation to me galling nonetheless. “what about me?” i wanted to yell. “you’re losing me too. me! do i really leave you completely indifferent?” i suppose we have both known for a long time that we were now together by default, even if we rarely dared to admit or acknowledge it, even to ourselves. for the sake of our tadpole. out of inertia. or fear of change and upheaval. so where the jagged emotions should have been, there was now just a gaping void. part of me feels cheated. after working myself up to this finale over a week of sleepless nights and adrenaline-fuelled days, it was a resounding anti-climax. i wanted to be wept over bitterly or gallantly fought for. mourned, or regretted just a little. so that i felt like i was someone worth having in the first place. comments (61) older posts » search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered
