petite anglaise may 28, 2007 petite 2.0 filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:30 pm having written an article for comment is free back in april about internet footprints and the danger inherent in leaving personal data all around the internet for future employers/parents-in-law to see, what have i gone and done? enlarged my trail from its previously modest sparrow-like proportions into an elephant-sized paw print of worrying dimensions, that’s what. a week of enforced inactivity in a yorkshire village was all it took to unleash my inner 2.0 monster. the eagle-eyed among you have already noticed the petite myspace link in the sidebar, to your right, along with my facebook profile and associated non-official “fan” site, with its own cafepress merchandise store (i shan’t link to these as they are not my own creations). i’ve been scrobbling away in lastfm and joining groups with names that made me snort my yorkshire tea down my nose. the only thing i have so far managed to resist – and i must, because it is the internet version of crack cocaine – is twitter. but i fear it is only a matter of time. where will it all end? will i find myself unable to engage in any form of communication which does not involve a keyboard? will my macbook become welded to my satin pyjama clad thighs? i fear for the future. comments (51) may 26, 2007 yorkshire tag cloud filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 6:23 pm beer curry top shop naughty new bag satin pyjamas clarks shoes borders fish & chips oolite lastfm yorkshire tea tesco guinness bacon sandwiches custard tart charlie and lola comments (39) may 24, 2007 pic-nique filed under: good time girl, miam — petiteanglaiseparis @ 11:39 am do you blog? are you in paris on saturday 9 june? do we look like the sort of people you would like to spend quality time with? details here, including email for signing yourselves up… comments (25) votez utile filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 11:20 am so, um, petite in jimjams? anyone? cast your votes here. and don’t forget my dear friends anna boat (personal) – eek, and lucy pepper too in same category, how is one supposed to choose? – jonnyb (uk), le blagueur à paris (expat, writing) and nardac (underappreciated) … update: results are available for viewing here. comments (52) older posts » search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com. post to cancel
