petite anglaise may 12, 2009 development filed under: knocked up — petiteanglaiseparis @ 5:44 pm meet the foetus. a little weekly ritual of mine and tadpole’s consists of looking up on various websites the info for whatever week of pregnancy i happen to be in (the tail end of week 16 at the time of writing) and reading out the recap of baby’s development. ‘ooh, it’s got fingernails!’ i shriek. or ‘ew, it can wee in the water in my tummy!’ (which is the technical term for amniotic fluid, in case you were wondering.) the one thing i dislike about these week-by-week foetal development diaries is that the writers, pursuing the laudable aim of making things as concrete and real as possible, tend to compare the size of the beast to that of a piece of fruit, say. in week 16-17, for example, baby is officially the size (but not yet the weight) of an avocado. the problem with this, i find, is that when, after a week of eyeing up said avocado (and wondering why, if it’s that small, my belly is already the size of a large melon), i finally give in to the urge to eat it, french style, by cutting it in half, smothering it in french dressing and scooping out the flesh with a teaspoon, i feel somewhat uneasy. not guilty, exactly, but let’s just say i don’t enjoy my feast quite as much as i should. so, in order to remove ersatz-foetus from my diet altogether, tadpole and i have devised the revolutionary soft toy sizing systemtm instead. (so, um, yes, the baby is the tiger, not the passport. the passport is provided for the purposes of scale.) tadpole’s soft toy collection is (dusty and) varied, and i look forward to the coming weeks, when tiger will be replaced by wibbly pig, for example, or peter rabbit. i must admit that i’m slightly less thrilled at the prospect of week 20, where my only correctly-sized option will be a big-nosed replica of postman pat, complete with spectacles and satchel. but the real problem, of course, will come when we get beyond the week 30 watershed, which represents the largest teddy in tadpole’s collection – a wopping 30 cm long. how, i wonder to myself, shooting teddy an anxious sidelong glance and ‘kegeling’ furiously on the inside, can i possibly play host to something that will actually end up being more like 50 cm long at full term? something which, in food terms, is described by babycentre’s helpful website as ‘a small pumpkin’? i feel there is an argument, from that point onwards, for abandoning the ‘concrete and real’ approach and adopting a policy of deliberate vagueness instead, while simultaneously outlawing every ruler and tape measure in the house. and needless to say, pumpkin will be off the menu chez petite come october. as will halloween. comments (46) search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
