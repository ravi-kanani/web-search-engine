arts & entertainment · media & journalism · uk affairs in laurence fox’s case, get you officially denounced – and then a payout for being denounced. in the midst of a pandemic, this story, comparatively trivial but not without consequences, may have passed you by. laurence fox is an actor and musician. two months ago he caused rather a stir on the bbc political panel show question time. i posted about it here: has the bbc stopped putting bromide in its actors’ tea? as i said in that post, the actors’ union equity helped spread the story by calling on actors to “unequivocally denounce” their fellow. yes, those exact words. equity has now backtracked, but it went to prove mr fox’s point. in the end equity had to do more than backtrack. on march 13th the guardian reported, equity apology to laurence fox sparks string of resignations. the entire race equality committee of equity has resigned in protest after the actors’ union apologised on its behalf for criticising laurence fox’s views on race and paid an out-of-court settlement to the actor after he threatened to sue them for libel. i am sure they will be greatly missed. the former star of the detective drama lewis also used his appearance on the bbc discussion show to insist it was “racist” for an audience member to call him “a white, privileged male”. “we’re the most tolerant, lovely country in europe,” he said at the time. “it’s so easy to throw the card of racism at everybody and it’s really starting to get boring now.” in the aftermath of his appearance, minority representatives of the actors’ union made a series of accusations on twitter against fox, saying he wanted to “berate and bully women of colour attempting to discuss issues of race and gender discrimination”. narrator’s voice: he didn’t really. on friday, the actors’ union issued a carefully worded statement apologising for the comments, with sources saying a payment had been made to the actor: “we are sorry that in the tweets he was called a ‘disgrace’ by equity. it was a mistake for equity as an organisation to criticise him in this way. nothing in equity’s later statement was intended as a slur on his character or views, or to suggest that he should be denied the ability to work. we would like to make that clear. equity and laurence fox condemn prejudice unequivocally in all its forms.” daniel york loh, the former chair of the race equality committee, said he and his eight other colleagues on the committee, elected by the union’s minority ethnic members, felt forced to resign as a result of the decision to apologise to the actor. i think that should read “as a result of the decision to apologise to their own member”. he tweeted: “equity and la*rence f*x can issue as many joint statements and apologies as they like. it’s nothing to do with me and i apologise for nothing.” if mr loh says that equity’s apology is nothing to do with him, i assume that means that he has not just resigned from the union’s race equality committee but from the union itself – which in practice would mean that he has resigned from being an actor. a principled decision indeed. fox, a member of a well-known acting family, previously said he was concerned he would not be able to work following the intervention from the equity race equality committee. a source close to fox said a particular concern was its call for him to be “unequivocally denounced” for his comments on race, which could have reduced his ability to earn money from roles and make a living to enable him to look after his family. having lost its race equality committee, equity might like to see if it can manage without replacing this expensive luxury. march 22nd, 2020 | 7 comments the death clock johnathan pearce (london) · asian affairs · media & journalism a few years ago i remember the arrival of a sort of clock that measured the terrifying rise of the uk’s public debt, a pile that has got much heavier and scarier as a result of the splurge of spending enacted by the new uk finance minister last week. the idea of some dial on the dashboard of our lives, so to speak, which rises constantly, or maybe eventually slows and reverts, is an interesting one. in the media, some newspapers seem to have these daily counts of the number of people dying of coronavirus. on some of the tv channels there is a scrolling feed at the bottom of the screen (i saw this on sky news, which is arguably even worse than the bbc these days) do this. it was rather like the tickers for the level of the s&p 500 or the latest cricket scores from lords. a writer on linkedin, whom i quote from here but i won’t name as i am not sure i have permission, has written this, and i do sort of sympathise: is the news going to report every single death which include a majority of elderly people each day death by death? many have cancer or asthma or weak immune systems or underlying health issues and many may be on respirators in assisted living or hospitals so how do we know the real cause of death? smokers who harmed their lungs. rx’s that damaged lungs and organs such as the heart. every person is different. the news or government doesn’t report the 109 americans who die everyday or the 660,000 deaths of individuals from cancer each year. how about the 47,000 plus individual deaths by suicide and illicit drugs? how long is the scare mongering going to linger on? will be it be until july or august or longer? viruses and diseases are always popping up…influenza, asian influenza 1950’s, hong kong flue 1960’s, meningitis, aids, mers, sars, swine flu, ebola…..we don’t know what else may have contributed to the death. just sayin’. of course the state should not in any way ban or try and interfere with such reporting, whether it is crass, hysterical, or sober. at least in the west the media is covering this outbreak heavily, whereas in china, as appears to be the case, people who blew the whistle on what was going on have been punished or just disappeared. march 17th, 2020 | 71 comments everybody gets to be racist eventually natalie solent (essex) · how very odd! · media & journalism · mindless "inequality" blather · uk affairs the latest newly discovered racist is trevor phillips. trevor phillips, the former head of the equalities watchdog, has condemned labour’s decision to suspend him from the party over alleged islamophobia, while defending his view that the uk muslim population is “different”. phillips, a pioneering anti-racism campaigner who previously chaired the equality and human rights commission (ehrc), has been suspended from labour pending an investigation and could be expelled. to me, the remarks in question seem to have an honest attempt to engage with the fact that the attitudes of the muslim population do differ sharply from the uk average – surely a matter of public interest. some here, remembering mr phillips’ previous role as head of the commission for racial equality and his lifetime of commitment to the ideal of enforced equality, will speak of karma and say “what goes around comes around”. i disagree. as a matter of policy and humanity, when someone starts to move in the right direction we should not rebuff them. march 9th, 2020 | 24 comments samizdata quote of the day samizdata illuminatus (arkham, massachusetts) · economics, business & globalization · media & journalism · slogans & quotations the guardian, wrong about everything, always. doubly so on anything economic. – tim worstall march 5th, 2020 | 8 comments why jack powell and 1828 are not wasting their time trying to influence the conservative party – despite what steve davies says brian micklethwait (london) · activism · education & academia · media & journalism · opinions on liberty · political economy · uk affairs tomorrow evening, i am hosting a talk at my home which will be given by jack powell. here’s the short biographical note that powell sent me, to send out to my email list of potential attenders: jack powell founded 1828, which is a new neoliberal news and opinion website, to champion freedom, especially within british conservative politics. he is the editor of the website as well as being in his final year at king’s college london, studying spanish and portuguese. interesting guy. here is the link to the 1828 website. in the spiel about his talk that followed, powell goes on to say that 1828 is especially trying to champion freedom in british universities. what this actually means is that he’ll be operating in the territory where politicians and students come together, to think about the bigger picture. an important spot in the political landscape, i think. in general, powell’s blurb for his talk abounds with ambition, energy, enthusiasm, attention to detail, and also with the names of conservative party politicians (liz truss, priti patel) and media organisations (capx, guido, quillette, new statesman) with whom 1828 has had dealings and who have said good things about the efforts that powell and the rest of the 1828 team have been making. i have spent my libertarian life so far trying to spread libertarianism way beyond the merely party political arena, an approach which paid off big time when the internet arrived, in the form of such wonders as, well, samizdata. but part of the reason i did that was that when i started out being a libertarian activist, it seemed to me that too many people were doing only party politics, and not enough people were trumpetting broader and undiluted libertarian principles to the wider world. there was not nearly enough proclaiming of the libertarian “metacontext”, as we here like to put it. but ever since that earlier time, the last two decades of the previous century basically, the conservative party, and in particular its youth membership, has moved away from those freedom-oriented principles and towards the as-much-government-as-we-can-afford-and-then-some position. i am very glad that people like jack powell are now trying to reverse that trend. recently, and i’m not changing the subject, i attended a talk given by steve davies, in which he talked, as he frequently does these days, about political realignment. in particular, davies has long been noticing a definite shift by the conservative party away from free market policies and towards economic dirigisme. this shift, he says, is no mere whim of the people who happen to have been leading the party. he sees a deeper trend in action. so, does that mean that jack powell and his fellow 1828-ers are wasting their time talking to and listening to conservative politicians? my short answer is: no, they are not. i say this not because i assume that davies is wrong about where he sees the conservatives going. i now suspect that he exaggerates this shift somewhat, but the policy direction he sees is the direction i also see, as, now, do many others. but that doesn’t mean that 1828-ers communing with truss, patel and also with the likes of the recently resigned chancellor sajid javid and with the likes of steve baker won’t count for anything. when politics goes through upheavals of the sort that davies now observes, this doesn’t mean that all the politicians who lose internal battles within their parties just vanish. some do, but others often hang around and find new party settings to operate in, new allies to collaborate with. davies himself said this in his talk, and offered historical examples of just such behaviour, by william gladstone for example. therefore, any time and effort that the 1828-ers spend talking to, listening to and generally cheering on freedom-sympathetic politicians could end up being very significant, no matter what happens to the broader political landscape. you can never be entirely sure, but neither sajid javid nor steve baker seem to me like they are about to just fade away without any more fight. baker in particular, fresh from his brexit agonies and ecstasies, is now making all sorts of promising noises. scroll down, for instance, to the bottom of this piece, where it says: the outgoing erg chair has said he wanted to focus more on constituents and that it was time for him to “return to certain economic issues which i consider as least as important to the future of the country as exiting the eu”. the writer of the piece, david scullion, adds: the wycombe mp is known to be critical of the current system of global finance and what he sees as the problems of keynesian ‘easy money’. if you doubt baker’s continuing commitment to such ideas, just listen to what he starts saying about two thirds of the way through this very recent interview with scullion. that’s the same link twice, but that’s not the half of what it deserves. really, seriously. as i believe they say on american battleships: now hear this! now hear this! not many politicians have major impact on two huge issues in one career and in one lifetime, but if i had to pick someone who might be about to score two out of two, i’d now bet on baker. so, whatever jack powell and his 1828 mates manage to accomplish in the years to come, it is likely to do some good. listening to him talk about that tomorrow evening will be very interesting. february 27th, 2020 | 8 comments a recorded conversation about the falklands war brian micklethwait (london) · historical views · latin american affairs · media & journalism · military affairs · uk affairs just to give a light tap to a small drum, which nobody else will tap if neither of us does, and just to say: fellow samizdatista patrick crozier and i recently did one of our recorded-and-internetted conversations, this time about that strange event called in these parts: the falklands war, which happened in early 1982. listen to this by going here. further thoughts about this historical event and this conversation from me here. (see also an earlier posting i did, about a very strange british public personality who emerged onto british tv during that war.) somewhat inconveniently, for many, our conversation does rather go on a bit, for over an hour. but i have recently been finding myself spending what used to be my television time instead listening to things not unlike these conversations that patrick and i have taken to doing – podcasts, youtubery and so forth (many of these things involving dave rubin (a recent discovery of mine)). so i thought it worth mentioning our effort(s) here. february 27th, 2020 | 4 comments the independent on naomi seibt rob fisher (surrey) · media & journalism · science & technology i had not heard of naomi seibt until my phone suggested i read an article about her in the independent. it quotes her thus: science is entirely based on intellectual humility and it is important that we keep questioning the narrative that it out there instead of promoting it, and these days climate change science really isn’t science at all. […] climate change alarmism at its very core is a despicably anti-human ideology […] especially as a german, it is so rude to refer to someone as a climate denier because obviously there is a connection to the term ‘holocaust denier’, which carries a lot of weight in germany. […] immense impact that the sun has on the climate in comparison to co2 emissions. […] we must not make ourselves the victim of a tight tax corset…we must not deny ourselves, or the people from awfully poor third world countries access to cheap and reliable energy.” […] rage and panic belong to our opponents […] do not create an ideology out of something that a young girl has to say. regardless of the political side she’s on. all this seems fairly moderate. the indy describes her thus: gaining support from right-wing organisations, including germany’s far-right party afd party, and a think tank with links to the white house […] her stance on the climate apparently caught the attention of the heartland institute, a us think tank based in chicago, which has previously lobbied on behalf of tobacco firms, supports fracking and rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. […] the heartland institute’s support and promotion of seibt has set alarm bells ringing. […] those remaining groups and individuals threatened by the weight of climate science appear to believe ms seibt is some sort of opposition figure who can inspire people through similar means […] but while ms thunberg is merely hammering home the science – that 97 per cent of peer-reviewed climate studies agree with the scientific consensus that manmade global warming is real – ms seibt appears to have more interest in ideology. […] alongside her interest in climate denial, she has voiced concerns about immigration and feminism, and has previously spoken at events run by germany’s far-right afd (alternative for germany) party. she has denied being a member of the far-right group, but previous reports suggest she is or has been a member of the party’s youth wing. deciding whose language sounds more ideological i leave as an exercise for the reader. february 25th, 2020 | 13 comments heresies of our time: that children should be taught to read music natalie solent (essex) · arts & entertainment · children's issues · education & academia · media & journalism · uk affairs as trotsky never said about war, and only maybe said about the dialectic, “you may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you.” richard morrison is the music critic of the times and writes for bbc music magazine. a man at the heart of the arts establishment, one might reasonably think. but he had an unsettling experience not long ago: do i talk rubbish? the thought crosses my mind frequently, but with particular force as i chaired a discussion at the annual conference of the people who run britain’s orchestras. the talk turned to education and i expressed my fervent belief that teaching children to read music is the key that opens up everything. first jolt: the music director of arts council england (ace), no less, vehemently disagreed with me. musical literacy doesn’t matter much, she declared. second jolt: in the ensuing discussion not a single person spoke in my favour. more than 100 people were in the room, all engaged in running orchestras that depend on instrumentalists who can sight-read to an incredible level, and not one agreed that teaching children to read music was a good idea. after the event i had coffee with someone in the audience. “of course nobody sided with you,” she claimed. “everyone here depends on ace subsidy. nobody will contradict publicly what the ace music director says.” this was not a singular event. as mr morrison writes in his times article, “the arts world is tolerant, as long as you’re left wing and anti-brexit”, i wouldn’t recount this small personal trauma except that it suddenly seems so relevant. today the excellent website artsprofessional published freedom of expression, a report based on a large survey it conducted last autumn into censorship and self-censorship in the cultural sector. by promising anonymity to participants, it has lifted the lid on a shocking state of affairs. here’s a sector that prides itself on tolerance and free speaking. in reality it seems that the opposite is true. nearly 80 per cent of participants agreed that “workers in the arts who share controversial opinions risk being professionally ostracised”. you can speak freely within your arts organisation, it seems, only if you conform to a narrow set of political and social views. take brexit. i knew that most arts people were fervently against it, but i didn’t realise how much pressure was put on pro-brexiteers working in the arts to, basically, shut up. one participant claimed that “in our organisation those who voted to leave the eu have been ostracised”. another noted that “17.4 million voted for brexit”, but that “most of the opinions of these people, on many subjects, would lose them employment in the publicly funded arts sector”. the “artsprofessional” survey he mentions was introduced here and the findings can be read here (subscription required). i did wonder why teaching children to read music has come to be regarded as a bad thing. i suspect it is part of the same phenomenon that has caused the oxford classics faculty to propose dropping homer and virgil from the first part of an oxford classics degree. the oxford student newspaper reports that it …has been notified about a proposal by the classics faculty to remove the study of homer’s iliad and virgil’s aeneid from the mods syllabus, a decision which has surprised many across the faculty. this proposal forms part of a series of reforms aimed to modernise the first stage of the classics degree, known as moderations (mods), which take place during hilary term of second year for all students taking classics courses across the university. the mods course, which is assessed by a set of ten exams at the end of hilary, has been increasingly criticised in recent years, due to the attainment gaps found between male and female candidates, as well as between candidates who have studied latin and/or greek to a-level (course i) and those who have not (course ii). the removal of virgil and homer papers, which take up two out of the ten mods papers, have been marketed as a move that will reduce the attainment gaps and thus improve access to the subject. educational “attainment gaps” between the official oppressors and the officially oppressed are to be avoided at all costs, except that of providing teaching of a high and even standard to all. what are they afraid of? when the victorians saw an attainment gap between the upper and the labouring classes they did things like build a university for working people, funded by contributions from the meagre paypackets of quarrymen and farmers. when the early feminists saw an attainment gap between men and women they attained to such effect that the gender gap in the universities is now the other way round. they closed educational gaps by pushing upwards. we don’t even have the honesty to openly push downwards. february 23rd, 2020 | 28 comments name me one good thing about brexit… natalie solent (essex) · european union · internet · media & journalism · science & technology · uk affairs start with this: article 13: uk will not implement eu copyright law universities and science minister chris skidmore has said that the uk will not implement the eu copyright directive after the country leaves the eu. several companies have criticised the law, which would hold them accountable for not removing copyrighted content uploaded by users, if it is passed. eu member states have until 7 june 2021 to implement the new reforms, but the uk will have left the eu by then. the uk was among 19 nations that initially supported the law. that was in its final european council vote in april 2019. this samizdata post from march 2019 contains a list of links to other posts that give the background. january 26th, 2020 | 17 comments - (comments are closed) has the bbc stopped putting bromide in its actors’ tea?
