possible hey everyone, pat here again. i was a one-man-band when i started spi back in 2008. but even back then, i had a lot of help‚Äîfrom friends, advisors, and others. a lot has changed since then. over the years, i began working with more and more talented professionals to help me get things done. i hired freelance designers, business strategists, specialized agencies, lawyers, accountants, web developers, event coordinators, and other types of contractors. they all helped me think bigger, make wise decisions, create valuable things (like podcasts, courses, and live events), and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîdeliver on my commitments to you, the fans. that way of working was good for a while. it was instrumental in helping spi get here. but as the saying goes, what got you here doesn‚Äôt always get you there. i started to feel that way in 2018. it had been a decade since spi began. things were still growing, but i‚Äôm not sure i‚Äôd say they were scaling, at least not in a healthy way. my time, energy, and attention were becoming increasingly drained as i pushed to do even bigger things, like flynncon. that‚Äôs when i knew spi was ready for a big change. the big change came in the form of formally joining forces with my longtime creative agency, winning edits. matt and his team merged ‚Äúin-house‚Äù here at spi. at the same time, i hired my longtime assistant, jess, onto the in-house team. bringing the core talent into the fold was the energy spark spi (and myself, personally) needed to make the leap into an exciting new phase of possibilities, growth, and achievement. don‚Äôt worry! we‚Äôre not at all ‚Äúcorporate-y‚Äù. and i‚Äôm not going anywhere. we‚Äôre merely a better organized business and more focused team with a far greater ability to elevate entrepreneurs to within reach of their dreams! now, without further ado, i‚Äôm thrilled to introduce you to everyone! team spi we exist to educate and train a world-wide community of entrepreneurs.
