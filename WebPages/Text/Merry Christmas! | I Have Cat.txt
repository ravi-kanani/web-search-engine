the answer isn’t as obvious as you may think. cat woman wednesday: foster mom & cat photographer tania hennessy → merry christmas! posted on december 25, 2016 by tamar wishing you and your family – 2 legged and 4 – peace and health this holiday season and in the new year. thank you to all of you who have supported me and i have cat throughout the years. 2016 has personally been one of both great joy and sadness which i wrote about in my thanksgiving post. i feel blessed to have had my cat community – on and offline – during the good times and bad. i only hope you all have the support – or can find it in the i have cat online community. my heart breaks a little knowing this is the last year sweet petie will be featured on my card. missing him so much this holiday season and thinking of all of you who have lost loved ones – 2 legged and 4 – and how hard this time of year is for you. i wanted to share a few of our holiday cards from the past. from two years ago, the last christmas card i made when petie was still alive. not sure which year this was from….guess i was trying to get creative! and last but not least, from 2009, the first holiday season in the life of this blog – well before haddie was in the picture petie would have been around 3 years old here. i’d like to leave you with a link to a post from my friend blogger joanne mcgonagle of the tiniest tiger about the most important gift we can give to ourselves and our loved ones this holiday season (one i need to work on) – the gift of being present. hugs, kisses, meows and purrs, tamar, kip, haddie and petie too xo this entry was posted in uncategorized and tagged christmas, holidays. bookmark the permalink. ← does a cat make a good gift?
