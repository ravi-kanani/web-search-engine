(comments are closed) to coin money and regulate the value thereof midwesterner (wisconsin, usa) · economics, business & globalization · north american affairs this all too serious joke has steadily gained traction among the self anointed cognoscenti. probably one reason they think “hope®” it will work is because it is “legal”. we don’t make the loopholes. we just find them. the treasury can’t print money on its own, because the money supply is supposed to be the strict purview of the federal reserve … but that might not be quite so strict after all, thanks to a coin-sized exception. congress passed a law in 1997, later amended in 2000, that gives the secretary of the treasury the authority to mint platinum coins, and only platinum coins, in whatever denomination and quantity he or she wants. that could be $100, or $1,000, or … $1 trillion. and we know that congress has the power “to coin money and regulate the value thereof”, right? the constitution says so, right? → continue reading: to coin money and regulate the value thereof january 12th, 2013 | 40 comments - (comments are closed) a good day for limited government midwesterner (wisconsin, usa) · civil liberty & regulation · north american affairs there is a lot of conflicting opinion being fired at the us supreme court’s ruling(pdf) on “obamacare”. it is certainly a curious ruling both on first and subsequent reads. i think the opinions in the decision make a great deal of, perhaps complete, sense when viewed in the terms of ‘doing a marbury v madison‘. that was a decision written by chief justice marshall in 1803. from that decision, marshall is regarded as the founder of the supreme court and the judicial branch as it came to be understood and accepted in the balance of powers. in this article, i am not addressing the merits of the affordable care act, i am speaking to the constitutional elements at work in the decision. roberts declares his view of judicial legislating in one succinct sentence. “it is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.” notice he said “political” choices. if something can be allowable under the constitution, then a restrained court goes out of its way to accommodate it to the constitution. if something is constitutionally permissible, then whether or not to do it is entirely within the sphere of politics, not constitutional law. we will never find perfect masters and expecting the supreme court to attempt that role is contrary to limited government. roberts appears to be channeling mencken with this declaration. → continue reading: a good day for limited government june 29th, 2012 | 128 comments - (comments are closed) on originalism midwesterner (wisconsin, usa) · civil liberty & regulation · opinions on liberty · philosophical what law of physics obligates the existence of a moral code? why don’t rocks and trees and lions and zebras have moral codes? what is it that makes human decisions a special case that is different from all other things and creatures? philosophers have struggled over the concept of right and wrong since before fire was captured for domestic use. in the time since then there have probably been as many moral codes as there have been philosophers to think of them. most of them have one thing in common; they are claiming a lever to compel the behavior of others. do lions and zebras have moral codes? of course not. lions attack and zebras defend. zebras are (i’ve heard) a principal non-human killer of lions. they break the lion’s jaw with well placed kicks while attempting to escape. unable to eat, the lion starves to death. is a lion committing a moral wrong when it attacks a zebra? is a zebra committing a moral wrong when it kicks a lion? of course not, lions are lions and zebras are zebras. there is no moral code for lions and zebras beyond continuing their gene pool. with only that for guidance, all of their interactions tend towards extreme violence. carrying on one’s gene pool is an internal imperative to each individual. there is no external imperative in the laws of physics that a particular gene pool must be continued. if one line ends, (other) life goes on. there is no external imperative for a lion or zebras’ moral code. nor for a human’s. → continue reading: on originalism may 3rd, 2012 | 84 comments -

(comments are closed) system ‘d’ midwesterner (wisconsin, usa) · economics, business & globalization for any of you who may be feeling particularly depressed about the state of the economy, politics and the regulatory leviathan in general, this will cheer you up greatly. it certainly improved my overall outlook. although this trend is very much a good thing, i do have some concerns. one of them is for intellectual property protection. all advances in technology and the arts are the result of intellectual endeavors, and assuring the rewards and return on investment of those endeavors is essential to continue the advances. another concern i have is for ‘real’ property rights. i would very much like to hear from any of the samizdata commentariat who have access to, and perhaps even do business in “l’economie de la débrouillardise.” as the dollar and the euro flare off into nothingness like the methane from a decomposing landfill, i presume system ‘d’ is plan ‘b’ for advanced western societies as well. how will that unfold? november 3rd, 2011 | 17 comments - (comments are closed) institutional will midwesterner (wisconsin, usa) · activism · civil liberty & regulation do institutions have a will that transcends, and can run contrary to, those who create and staff them? in the early seventies my high school participated in a program that allowed students to access the illinois institute of technology computers for instructional purposes. in a room off of the school library sat two teletype 33 terminals, one of them equipped with foam telephone ear cups and a modem. we would code our programs onto paper tape and then, during our school’s allocated time, feed them into the iit mainframe for compiling and executing. the second thing i learned after how to get the mainframe to understand that i was sending it a program, was that computer programs have a will of their own that is totally apart from my will. my will is to get the answers to the formulas i am trying to solve. the program’s will is to follow the next instruction. occasionally, to the programmer’s embarrassment and the rest of the computer club’s amusement, an errant program would set off in a quixotic attempt to consume all of our allocation of cpu clock time, empty the box of paper and wear out the printer ribbon, in an infinite pursuit of pointless activity. an example of this might be if i told the program to stop when a particular value reached “25”, but then inadvertently instructed it to count up in units of two. since the counter stepped from “24” straight to “26”, it never did reach “25” and the program tripped merrily along, consuming all of the resources it could acquire. later i was employed working on a burroughs computer. it had a lovely missile-launch style red button labeled “clear memory” shielded underneath a spring-loaded, hinged, clear plastic cover. when programs ran amok, we could lift the cover and administer an instant memory wipe to the cpu, returning control to the system operator. how does computer programming pertain to institutional will? institutions, whether they are small temporary government programs, or über institutions like a constitution, are nothing but computer programs executing procedural instructions on a societal mainframe. just like electronic programs, institutions can evade their constraints and wildly consume resources, until a counter-procedural force stops them. → continue reading: institutional will october 2nd, 2011 | 42 comments -
