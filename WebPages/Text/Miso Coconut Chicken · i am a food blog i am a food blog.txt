contact work with us from the archives: crispy chicken fried steak bites with white wine sausage gravy recipes → mains → miso coconut chicken jump to recipe mains/meat/recipes miso coconut chicken posted march 5, 2014 by stephanie everyone has their favorite pantry staples and one of mine is coconut milk. i’m not sure why, but a can of coconut milk makes me feel safe. so much so that i have back-up cans, just in case. you may get a strange look from the checkout person with your abundance of cans, but you’ll be the one laughing when you’re at home, looking into the pantry and spying your coconut treasure trove. coconut milk is seriously versatile – sweet or savory, breakfast or dinner, it can handle it all. i especially love it in stews or braises. what’s even tastier is when you pair coconut with miso. miso is definitely another one of my pantry staples and my miso of choice is shiro, or white. it’s a bit milder than the other varieties you can get (yellow or red), but it adds a lot of earthy, mellow flavor to any soups, stews, or braises. my first intro to miso, like most people i know, was that standard watered-down complimentary bowl of soup you get from a subpar japanese restaurant. needless to say, i wasn’t impressed with the flavour. when i did have a real bowl of miso soup however, i was blown away. miso is subtle, salty, and incredibly addictive. i’ve been known to spread it on toast, mix it into dressing and have it with eggs and asparagus. this post started out as a ode to coconut milk, but i think miso is quickly taking over! how about you guys? what are your pantry/fridge staples? oh, by the way, this miso coconut chicken stew is best eaten with lots of white rice — i prefer japanese koshihikari. white rice might not be the healthiest, but really, it should be your only go-to for soaking up this saucy, creamy, coconuty deliciousness. miso coconut chicken serves 3 to 4 4-6 skin on boneless chicken thighs salt and freshly ground pepper oil 1/2 large onion, diced 1/2 inch piece of ginger, minced, about 1 tablespoon 1 pound mushrooms, sliced 2 garlic cloves, minced 1-2 tablespoons miso paste, depending on miso salt level 2 tablespoons water 1 14-oz can unsweetened coconut milk* sliced green onions, to garnish crushed red peppers, optional rice, quinoa, greens, bread or your favorite starch, to serve pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. heat a bit of oil in a heavy bottomed pot over medium-high until hot and shimmery. add the chicken to the pan skin side down. brown deeply, 5-6 minutes and then transfer to a plate. turn the heat to medium and if there is a lot of fat that has rendered out, remove it until you have about a tablespoon of oil left. add the onion, ginger and garlic to the pot and cook until slightly soft, 5 minutes. add the mushrooms and cook. turn the heat up to medium-high and add the water and miso, being sure to scrape up all the brown bits. when the brown bits are dissolved and the miso is smooth, add the coconut milk. bring to a gentle simmer, add the chicken and cover. cook until the chicken is cooked through and can be easily pulled apart with a fork, about 30-40 minutes. taste, season with salt and pepper if needed and enjoy with green onions and crushed red peppers (if using). note: if you want to make this recipe cook up even more quickly, just cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. not only will they cook faster, but when it’s time to eat, everything is already bite-sized, which means the trip from your bowl to your mouth is that much more quick! if you do opt to go the bite-size route, reduce the simmering time down to 20 minutes. *make sure you’re using coconut milk and not cream. 61 comments molly yeh says: march 5, 2014 at 11:53 am hello, my new favorite combo! miso and coconut for the win! reply steph says: march 5, 2014 at 2:27 pm i’m into coconut everything right now! :d reply stephanie says: march 5, 2014 at 12:12 pm i am an addict to coconut milk as well! i love, love, love, adding it to stews and braises– i made melissa clark’s coconut braised short ribs and holy crap are they delicious. white rice is for sure the only choice for soaking up delicious sauce. sure, not the healthiest but all in moderation amiright? ;) reply steph says: march 5, 2014 at 2:27 pm white rice for the win! reply willow says: march 5, 2014 at 2:05 pm is there something that can be substituted in place of mushrooms? reply steph says: march 5, 2014 at 2:27 pm you could definitely omit the mushrooms or add in a vegetable. i think eggplant or zucchini would be quite nice! reply cynthia says: march 5, 2014 at 2:21 pm ho my gosh. miso and coconut sound like a match made in heaven. can’t wait to try this! reply steph says: march 5, 2014 at 2:28 pm ooh, i hope you get a chance to! :) reply allison (spontaneous tomato) says: march 5, 2014 at 2:33 pm i have a coconut milk-buying problem, too. i also buy multiple cans at once and make sure i have back-up cans just in case. :) for some reason, i am even more worried about running out of coconut milk than about running out of canned tomatoes, or dried lentils… (i don’t think i’d ever let myself run out of rice — since i use it too often — or miso, which i probably don’t use often enough!) this combination sounds so good! now i need to try pairing miso & coconut… reply sofia // papaya pieces says: march 6, 2014 at 5:49 am i always have some cans of coconut milk too.. just in case! i never know what i could do with miso (apart from soup) so thanks for these ideas! reply bonniw says: march 6, 2014 at 3:35 pm stunning pictures and tasty recipe. love love love this blog! reply ashley says: march 8, 2014 at 6:41 am favorite coconut milk brand? lovely recipe! reply steph says: march 8, 2014 at 2:33 pm i use aroy d, just out of nostalgia – it was always in my pantry growing up. reply debbie says: march 11, 2014 at 11:54 am which is your favorite coconut milk brand? i usually get the chao one from thailand, but i’m not liking it these days… reply maylin says: january 27, 2018 at 8:29 pm savoy coconut cream (dark blue can with palm tree illustration) or may ploy (i think that’s how it’s spelled – i don’t have one in stock to verify spelling). reply jesse says: march 12, 2014 at 9:56 am since you’re so coconut obsessed (as am i!), how come you didn’t cook your chicken in coconut oil? ps i read this sentence too fast: “i especially love it in stews and braises” and thought you said i especially love in stews and braless. ha! reply steph says: march 14, 2014 at 11:28 am ooh, coconut oil would take it over the top! reply robert says: march 12, 2014 at 7:07 pm great ppost stephanie! one of my fave pantry staples? okonomiyaki sauce!! like you were talking about miso’s versatility, you can use it on more than just okonomiyaki. reply steph says: march 14, 2014 at 11:28 am hmm, haven’t played around with okonomiyaki sauce much, but i do love it so i’ll have to give it a go in other dishes :) reply matt says: march 13, 2014 at 10:06 am hi, just wanted to thank you for this; it’s delicious. i’m eating leftovers for lunch today. for what it’s worth, i used rice vinegar instead of water, omitted the mushrooms, and used skinless chicken thighs. i’m going to add red bell peppers next time. reply steph says: march 14, 2014 at 11:29 am yum! so glad you liked it! reply joy bela says: march 25, 2014 at 1:41 pm i come to this recipe once a day just to look at it. i plan to make it one day….it looks stellar. reply cuisine lover says: march 27, 2014 at 12:54 am eat with miso soup would be perfect!! reply gord says: april 1, 2014 at 9:28 pm i’ve made this recipe twice and love it! i’ve used skinless boneless chicken thighs both times and it works wonderfully. reply steph says: april 2, 2014 at 9:02 am i’m so happy you liked it! reply shutterbug says: april 3, 2014 at 12:15 am i love coconut so much, i would make this dish and eat it with coconut rice, instead of plain white rice! ;) reply belby0 says: april 3, 2014 at 12:03 pm any chance the oz on the coconut milk is a typo? i cannot find a 16oz can (only 13.5 or 14oz) reply steph says: april 3, 2014 at 12:15 pm whoops. yes, most cans are 14 oz. i’m changing it now :) thanks for the heads up! reply rasa says: april 7, 2014 at 7:42 am this looks amazing – i need to try making it immediately! i love serving these types of dishes with white sushi rice too, but i always cook it with half water and half coconut milk. i completely understand your need to have coconut milk on hand at all times! reply hatti says: april 12, 2014 at 5:35 am can’t wait to try this. i may use coconut oil to fry the chicken? great blog. thanks for sharing. reply kate says: april 22, 2014 at 4:02 pm would using red miso change this dish a lot? it’s all i can find at my local grocery store. reply steph says: april 22, 2014 at 11:15 pm red miso will be fine, just make sure to start with one tablespoon and taste as you go. reply ayumi says: may 25, 2014 at 1:21 am just made this and it’s my new favourite thing. ever. so much deliciousness. thanks! reply tvontheweb says: june 1, 2014 at 5:41 pm made this dish for dinner and it was delicious. reply vanessa says: june 12, 2014 at 8:58 am made this! it was delicious (especially the mushrooms!), but be careful with the amount of coconut milk–it made me super nauseated. i think it may too much fat in one serving. reply emma says: september 19, 2014 at 6:30 am i’ve just recently had the time to sit down and make this recipe and omg it’s so good i’ve made it several times since! my boyfriend loves it – the other day he literally said, “if i had to decide, this would be my last meal on earth.” thanks for your simple, clear and easy to follow recipes! reply trang says: february 5, 2015 at 2:55 pm awesome ! i definitely will make it tonight, i have all the ingredients sitting in the fridge/freezer right now. reply joanne says: march 24, 2015 at 10:35 pm i made this today, and it was absolutely delicious! thank you for the recipe! reply jen says: may 10, 2016 at 12:09 pm this looks so good! i’m going to try it next weekend! reply nicole says: may 20, 2016 at 9:42 am i just made this the other day, and this is absolutely delicious. i made it a little heavier miso than coconut, but this was easy and yummy and something that tasted great the day after :)thanks for the recipe! reply vanina says: july 12, 2016 at 9:56 am i already have red miso, do you think i can use that one or should buy white miso instead? reply stephanie le says: july 12, 2016 at 10:27 am red miso should be fine, it’ll just have a different miso flavor. start with a bit, and add to taste :) reply allie says: january 1, 2017 at 11:19 pm i have miso broth but not miso paste, would i be able to use that instead? reply stephanie says: january 3, 2017 at 2:17 am i don’t really think it would work. you could try it and reduce the coconut milk but you definitely won’t be able to get that intense miso flavor :( reply christine vo says: october 29, 2017 at 1:56 pm is the browning step necessary for the recipe? just trying to simplify things when i can! :) reply stephanie says: october 29, 2017 at 2:11 pm hi christine, you can skip it, but i absolutely recommend it – it helps develop flavor :) i also like the texture of the skin more after it’s browned then braised, but it’s up to you! reply ridwan says: january 22, 2019 at 10:15 pm the flavors were fantastic. it was a match made in heaven. everything just worked so well together. the coconut milk, miso, ginger, black pepper. i replaced the mushroom with eggplant cuts, since i had some in my fridge. it was one of those very flavorful recipes that ill return to. thank you for the share! reply stephanie says: january 23, 2019 at 2:56 pm oh yay thank you so much for coming back and commenting :) reply allan says: october 1, 2019 at 3:00 am i can’t wait to make this recipe. i love miso. i love coconut milk. i love white rice. but i need a thai green curry recipe with white miso. anyone who can help? reply stephanie says: october 1, 2019 at 6:14 pm you can add a bit of thai green curry to this recipe. maybe do half thai green curry paste and half miso? reply lien says: october 14, 2019 at 3:02 am i am looking for a coconut miso braised pork recipe. i will try this but will replace the protein with pork shoulder. reply lien says: december 6, 2019 at 1:02 pm as an update, it turned out amazing! thank you for the recipe. reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website chickenchicken thighscoconutcomfort foodjapanesemisostew other posts you might enjoy march 5, 2014 fall salad: kabocha celery salad recipe march 5, 2014 dishoom’s chicken biryani recipe, simplified march 5, 2014 instant pot pasta and meatballs march 5, 2014 take out at home: the real lo mein recipe march 5, 2014 what to cook in november lemon pepper chicken with lemon and dill cous cousread one pan creamy dijon mustard mushroom chickenread spicy chili crisp white bean and barley stew with kale and eggsread recipe roundups small batch baking in times of stress: 11 small batch baking ideas small batch baking is not only the best form of self care, it’s also the best way to ration your precious baking supplies.see the list sunday brunch extra fluffy, super soft and custard-y japanese style tamagoyaki french toast this japanese tamagoyaki-inspired french toast is soft and custardy on the inside and crisp on the outside. the perfect combination of sweet and savory!best meal of the week basics & how to 10 tips and tricks to making the best stir fry how to make the best stir fry of your life plus a basic, use it everywhere simple stir fry sauce recipe!let's do it bread small batch baking in times of stress: 11 small batch baking ideas small batch baking is not only the best form of self care, it’s also the best way to ration your precious baking supplies.i knead this subscribe to our newsletter and never miss another post! follow @iamafoodblog about | faq | new here?
