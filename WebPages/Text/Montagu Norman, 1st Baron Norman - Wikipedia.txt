sir simon towneley and sir peregrine worsthorne. lord norman & cecilia had one child, colin norman, who inherited his father's baronetcy. according to burke's peerage, colin norman went on to have one son, adrian norman who went on to have one daughter, the now lady coralie joanne norman. in 1944, while visiting his brother on his country estate in hertfordshire, norman went for a walk and tripped over a cow, which may have kicked him in the head, causing an injury from which he never fully recovered.[10] lord norman died at his home thorpe lodge, arilie gardens off campden hill, london, in 1950 following a stroke. during his married life, he lived at the manor of st clere in kemsing, kent, which he acquired from his uncle in 1935.[11] footnotes[edit] ^ quigley, carroll (1966). tragedy & hope. new york: the macmillan company. pp. 62. isbn 0-945001-10-x. ^ "norman, montagu collet (nrmn889mc)". a cambridge alumni database. university of cambridge. ^ "no. 27359". the london gazette. 27 september 1901. p. 6326. ^ nicholas crafts, “walking wounded: the british economy in the aftermath of world war i” dated 27 august 2014 at voxeu.org ^ forbes, neil (2000), "doing business with the nazis" ^ blaazer, david (2005).
