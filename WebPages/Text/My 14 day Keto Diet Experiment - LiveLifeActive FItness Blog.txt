probably due to the fact i just stuffed my face with pizza today. oy! gotta love carb highs. my keto diet background i am not much of a “dieter”. i fail almost every time i try these days. now that i’m in my mid thirties (omg did i really just admit that to the world?!) it’s harder and harder to stick to a workout or diet plan these days. i have tried the keto diet once which was about a few months ago when trying to lose some weight for my brother’s wedding. i did it for about a week only and did drop a few pounds but i didn’t take it too seriously at the time. my current measurements / weight ewww the worst part has arrived. this is when i shamelessly tell you my weight and pretend like it never happened. starting weight: 158.8 lbs day 1 of 14 day keto diet experiment now that i’m slowly coming down from a “stuff my face with crap” weekend, my motivation is high. i can’t wait to give this experiment a try. although my motivation is super high right now, i’m also very nervous that i won’t be able to resist the carb life i have grown to love. i’m also worried about having enough energy to work out sparingly though my 14 day keto diet experiment. what i ate so, let’s be honest. i’m the furthest thing from a good cook. i often find myself eating the same things every day. it also doesn’t help that i’m super picky when it comes to food so i apologize in advance if you see a lot of the same foods day in and day out for me. if you’re looking for a blog with awesome keto diet recipes, this may not be your best blog series to follow 🙂 if you’re sticking with me, you’ll get a lot of the same boring foods day in and day out. let’s be real though, who has time to cook fancy meals every day. let’s see if i can do this 14 days with a super simple dieting approach breakfast i work from home and often times i don’t have an appetite early in the morning. i’m a big believer of the theory “don’t eat if you’re not hungry”. i listen to my body. that being said, around 10am i had a hard boiled egg to get me through to lunch. all is good in the world! lunch my lunch consisted of a homemade salad including: spinach shredded chicken green olives shredded cheese ranch dressing sunflower seeds the salad was actually delicious. how cool to be able to eat ranch dressing and cheese and be perfectly on track with my diet? dinner i had turkey meatballs and my all time favorite salsa for dinner (called pepita salsa). i picked the meatballs up frozen from trader joe’s. they were honestly not great but filled me up and did the job. snacks i had a 1/4 cup of almonds later on in the day. my puppy kept begging for some so i had to share with her. she’s too cute to say no to. i also had a glass of wine after dinner while watching bachelor in paradise. yes i’ll consider wine a snack! they say no alcohol on the keto diet but i am not a rule follower. this is my own experiment and i plan to continue to drink wine at night if i desire 🙂 oh i also typically drink a lot of diet coke. today i had zero diet cokes and only had my morning cup of coffee followed by a ton of water throughout the day. woohoo! workout i went to the gym for a simple 20 minute elliptical workout at lunch followed by a very brief back and bis lift. the whole workout was only about 30 minutes. i felt great though. full of energy and motivation. calories burned during workout: 270 calories macros / nutrition as mentioned above, my goal is to stick to 25 net calories or less each day. when i say “net carbs” that means grams of carbs minus grams of fiber = net carbs. my macros ended up looking like this at the end of the day. i’m not trying to hit any fat/fiber/protein goals, just strictly keeping an eye on my net carbs being under 25 at this point. net carbs: 24g fiber: 12g fat: 74g protein: 84g overall thoughts overall my first day went great. the diet wasn’t so bad and my energy level remained high throughout the day. i think i’ll chalk that up to it being day one of a new diet though. i’m sure the next few coming days will be much more difficult. bring on day two of my 14 day keto diet experiment!!! other posts that may interest you: next post – day 2 of the keto diet eating clean grocery list keto friendly recipe – cheesy and spicy sausage melt keto friendly recipe – baked kale chips filed under: keto diet, nutrition, personal tagged with: diet, keto diet, my weight loss experiement you may also enjoy: comment here! facebook wordpress please enable javascript to view the comments powered by google+. loading facebook comments ... please enable javascript to view the comments powered by facebook. leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website popular posts 1. eating clean grocery list – approved foods list 2. 101 gym quotes 3. how exercise can affect a woman’s menstrual cycle – live life active fitness blog 4. can you lose weight from hemorrhoid cream and saran wrap?
