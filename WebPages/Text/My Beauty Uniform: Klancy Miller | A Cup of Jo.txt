my mom is my touchstone for beauty stuff. she’s a big believer in facials, and she religiously got them at the christine valmy salon when i was growing up. she encouraged me to get them, but you know, you always have to rebel against your parents, so i avoided them for a long time. it wasn’t until i went to culinary school in paris that i realized how they give you a fresh start with your skin. i really like getting the extractions, weirdly. what else did you pick up in france? many of the french women i know are into a no-makeup look, so the emphasis is on maintaining your skin. i used nuxe products for skincare (i loved their honey face wash). and i always used phyto shampoo and conditioner for curly hair. you can get it here, but it’s much cheaper in france. my friends used to give me money to bring some home for them. now that it’s spring, are there any seasonal fruits and veggies you’re into? i love asparagus. there’s a recipe in cooking solo for asparagus roasted with berbere, an ethiopian spice, which is so good. i also love my friend julia turshen‘s recipe for asparagus salad with marcona almonds. oh, and lemon risotto with asparagus or spring peas! i eat lots of vegetables and fruit; they make me feel energetic. i love pomegranates, rambutan, apples, cherries, mangoes, papaya and all of the berries. i got that from my mom, who is a major health nut. she’ll literally call me sometimes and be like, ‘are you eating enough blueberries?’ what does your routine look like these days? i wake up between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. i look at instagram. sometimes i stretch to an old jane fonda video that my mom loaned me. sometimes i do yoga with adriene on youtube. i boil water, add the juice from half a lemon, and drink it. i make a to-do list for the day, and then i make breakfast, which is usually toast and tea, a blueberry smoothie or oatmeal. sometimes i’ll whip up a breakfast taco with a sunny side up egg, avocado and tomatoes. then i shower and get ready for the day. is the hot lemon water a digestion thing? it’s just because i need all the help i can get drinking water. i’m just like, one glass of water down, seven more to go! do you have a morning skincare regimen? yes, tracie martyn is my go-to for skin care products. years ago, i went to a beauty event, and she used her cleanser and a mask on me, and afterward my friend looked at me and said, ‘you look visibly different. you look better.’ i thought, sold! i use the amla purifying cleanser and the firming serum. they work the way they say they will, and i love the way they feel and smell. i see a huge difference in my skin (my mom always notices, too!). but they’re expensive, so when i run out, i have a good backup: weleda’s gentle cleansing milk. it’s less pricey and smells great. i love any fragrance with sandalwood, orange blossom or honeysuckle. do you have a signature scent? my favorites are santal 33 by le labo and zagara by santa maria novella. i also like aesop spray deodorant, which doubles as a perfume. i know that sounds weird, but it smells really good. are you a makeup person? yes! i swear by laura mercier and bobbi brown products, which i’ve used for years. on a regular day, i start with laura mercier hydrating primer, which serves as my moisturizer. then i put on laura mercier tinted moisturizer as foundation. i don’t use concealer; my sunglasses are my concealer! i use tarteist double take eyeliner and bobbi brown long-wear brow pencil. i finish with bobbi brown eye opening mascara and bobbi brown lipstick in red. that’s something else i picked up in paris — a red lip. what about special occasions? ha, well, the hardcore routine — which i only do if i’m going somewhere genuinely fancy — is to go to the bobbi brown counter at bergdorf goodman, and have them do it. it’s worth it to me on those occasions. i feel proud that i can do eyeliner, but that’s my only real application skill. do you do any other treatments? i do get acupuncture if something needs tweaking. i started last year when i had a terrible stiff neck. i went to yuka at olo acupuncture, and it was amazing! i also noticed that i was more chill and relaxed, which was an added bonus. i only go when i need to, but i love it. it’s kind of like meditation, but with a bunch of needles stuck all over you. what about soap or body wash? the one i use most often is dr. bronner’s. but i recently stayed at an ace hotel and fell in love with the rudy’s body wash that they have in their rooms. it’s orange-scented, and it’s so freakin’ good. i was thrilled to find out you can buy it! any other body-care accessories? in 2017, i was visiting a friend in tokyo, and we went to the onsen, a traditional hot-spring bathing spa. before getting into the bath, people will often scrub themselves down with mitts or brushes, pretty hard. i went to the pharmacy after and picked up a i use a japanese silk bathing mitt for myself, and i use it all the time to exfoliate at home. do you use lotion when you get out of the bath? yes, bliss’s naked body butter. if i need extra moisture, i use argan oil. i also learned an ayurvedic trick for moisturizing recently, which sounds very weird but i love. do tell. i went to a talk by shrankhla holecek, the founder of uma, an ayurvedic skin-care line. she mentioned this thing where you put coconut oil in your belly button and it moisturizes your lips! i was like, that is wild — but i had to try it. so, i put a little coconut oil in my belly button overnight and when i woke up, my lips did feel good! i know! i don’t even understand how it’s possible, except that the human body is so mysterious. let’s talk hair care. for a long time, i used tons of oils in my hair. but now i have a wonderful hairstylist, flavia, at vidal sassoon. she was like, ‘you’re using way, way too much.’ she pulled out this magic bottle of davines oi oil and said, ‘this is all you need.’ so, now i put a little on after i wash, and that’s the only hair product i use. when cooking, kitchen burns are a hazard of the trade. do you have any chef secrets for treating burned skin? i recently got a tip from carrie ann purcell, the food stylist for my cookbook. while working in the kitchen, she learned that you can put a raw tomato on your burns. i’ve tried it, and it does make it feel better. otherwise, if i burn myself, i just kiss it and put ice on it and suck it up. speaking of your book, i love the idea of a cookbook designed just for cooking for oneself. it’s been so gratifying to hear people’s stories. recently, a woman came up to me at a party and said, ‘i just got divorced, and your cookbook has been so helpful during this time.’ i’ve heard the same from other single people or young folks just out of college who are living on their own for the first time. and interestingly, i’ve also heard a lot from people who are married and have children, but everyone in their household eats something different because of allergies or preferences. so, they’re often cooking for themselves too. what do you make for yourself, when it’s just you? my go-to is a large salad and a piece of seafood. sometimes i’ll dress it up myself with preserved lemons, olive oil and salt. i also like haven’s kitchen chimichurri sauce. sometimes i’ll put some on a piece of salmon, pop it in the oven, make myself a salad and call it a day. it’s easy, and it’s great. thank you so much, klancy! p.s. more women share their beauty uniforms, including a polar explorer and a poet.

(also i get that i don’t have to cover up my imperfections, but i feel better when i do and i feel more like me, and that’s just as powerful as the opposite.) love cup of jo! :) april 19, 2019 5:57pm / reply joanna goddard says... yes for sure!! great point, we’re on it! april 19, 2019 6:31pm / mel says... i’d love to see this too! i dismiss most recommendations as they always seem to be for dry skin. april 21, 2019 8:03pm / cara m says... natalie, you read my mind! i came here to post exactly this same comment. i have limited scleroderma and my face is marked by broken red capillaries. i’ve recently embraced venturing out into the world without makeup – but it is a rare day. while i love my face (and wouldn’t trade it), it would be awesome to see how someone else works within these challenges. april 22, 2019 10:44am / victoria says... yes please! any other lifelong acne sufferers? i really don’t want to go back on a medication but since trading birth control for an iud, it’s been even worse. do i have to wait until after menopause or what? (i’m in my late 30s) april 24, 2019 7:53pm / kelly says... yes, that would be great! i’m nearing 30 with acne (still!!), and i’d love to know what people with adult acne use on their face both skincare and make-up wise. in all my years of having acne (15+), i’ve really yet to find a concealer/foundation that doesn’t look a bit off in some way with acne–highlighting dryness, doesn’t really cover a whitehead all that well, makes it look worse. april 25, 2019 1:02pm / michelle says... wanted to weigh in on this in case my experience could help someone. our skin is an incredible indicator of what is happening on the inside. i used birth control for 15 years and a few months after stopping my skin began to purge everything that the bc was suppressing for all those years (check out woman code on more info for properly getting off bc). never in my wildest dreams would i have imagined that i would have acne the way i did. i was already a healthy person and eating clean and what i thought was supportive to my body. but i went above and beyond to gently recover all those years of putting chemicals in my body. it took about two years of gut healing, following an ayurvedic diet, getting frequent acupuncture, (community acupuncture is a wonderful resource) and using marie veronique treatment line. non toxic and science based – this shit works! there were days where i couldn’t bare to look in the mirror and then there were days when i said f*ck it i’m going makeup free. i did find that kjaer weiss foundation worked well to cover the redness and didn’t make my skin feel like it was suffocating plus the packaging is refillable. it’s such a frustrating thing to deal with especially because it’s assumed that you will outgrow skin issues as an adult. april 25, 2019 1:28pm / mims says... adorable! she was stunning as a child, likely will be a stunning elder too. love her style and the shout for acupuncture. btw, many communities have low cost, sliding scale acupuncture clinics, you need not be wealthy to get acupuncture! https://www.pocacoop.com/what-is-ca-long-answer april 19, 2019 5:18pm / reply wendela says... love this! gorgeous woman! april 19, 2019 5:09pm / reply christina says... she has great style! april 19, 2019 3:24pm / reply katie peshek says... love love love that mother daughter photo – what a stunningly beautiful duo! april 19, 2019 11:23am / reply nina says... wow. that picture with the pink background – she is simply stunning. i love that she and her mom both have a blue striped shirt, so cute. she’s lovely. thanks for sharing april 19, 2019 11:23am / reply rachel says... would you ever do a beauty uniform with a woman who serves in the military? my college alumni magazine just featured this article: https://magazine.byu.edu/article/facing-ranger-dangers/ and it got me thinking. coj always does a great job of featuring inspiring women! april 19, 2019 10:36am / reply joanna goddard says... yes, that’s wonderful! thank you, rachel! april 19, 2019 11:05am / karyn says... absolutely wonderful profile. i cannot wait to try the coconut oil trick with my 7yo, who cannot stand the feel of lip balm, but who i think will be fascinated by the belly button experiment! april 19, 2019 9:42am / reply gemma says... absolutely loved this bu!!! and buying at least half of these products and her book asap. also drenching my belly button in coconut oil as i type this. gx april 19, 2019 8:02am / reply corinne says... just love this post. thank you! april 19, 2019 5:46am / reply andrea says... oh, i so enjoyed this! klancy is so beautiful, she glows. and she seems like such a lovely human, the kind that seems to have unlocked some secret to life, if you know what i mean. loved getting to read these responses and feel like now i have a bit of that secret too. and this cookbook concept! saved to my list of go-to gifts! april 19, 2019 12:38am / reply k says... her lips are just amazing. her red lipstick is a such a gorgeous statement. april 18, 2019 9:34pm / reply tiana says... i’m so jealous you get to be in france! it’s my dream place to travel to. i love how they go by the no makeup look. america needs to do more of that. natural beauty is always better in my opinion. your skin looks great by the way. april 18, 2019 9:03pm / reply eboni says... this is so wonderful! i wonder if klancy/cup of jo staffers might have recommendations for facial salons. i have darker skin and sometimes get nervous about finding the right place. any suggestions would be welcome! thank you! april 18, 2019 8:59pm / reply michelle says... she is lovely! love her taste in products and style. also, love the ayurvedic shout out! i trained with an amazing teacher in ny to become a practitioner. it’s an incredible science that supports who you are and what is best for your body. it constantly amazes me when i am putting it to practice to see just how connected our bodies are within itself and with the earth. april 18, 2019 8:58pm / reply emily says... damn, klancy’s glow in that first photo is unreal. she looks like a painting! and filing away that coconut oil tip to try on my own. april 18, 2019 8:42pm / reply noemi says... ohmg, yuka at olo is a genius woman who performs magic. seriously her acupuncture is life changing. april 18, 2019 8:00pm / reply mary beth says... omg i just love her! april 18, 2019 5:51pm / reply chandra says... so beautiful! she reminds me of my best friend. april 18, 2019 5:10pm / reply merri says... aesop deodorant is also my perfume most days. i love having a perfume soul sister out there! april 18, 2019 4:32pm / reply lauren says... great post but that headshot!!! i literally went ‘whoa’ and thought wait a minute, does this girl realize she’s the most beautiful woman in the world??! 😂 😊 april 18, 2019 4:32pm / reply andrea says... she is stunningly beautiful! april 18, 2019 8:08pm / julie says... seriously!! april 18, 2019 9:31pm / lindsay says... i’m so trying the coconut oil in my belly button tonight! april 18, 2019 4:05pm / reply aw says... gorgeous skin and hair! thank you for the tips. april 18, 2019 4:01pm / reply jeannie says... such a beautiful, down to earth woman with so many good tips! (her mom is gorgeous, too.) i have been toying with the idea of getting a facial and klancy’s enthusiasm for them has convinced me to do it. and i loved this line: “i don’t use concealer; my sunglasses are my concealer!” can’t wait to take a look at the cookbook! april 18, 2019 3:58pm / reply jessica says... klancy is beautiful! thank you for this post. about the bellybutton and lips… i’m an acupuncturist and facial diagnosis is one of the tools we use to understand what is going on in patients’ bodies. the stomach is reflected in the lips! it’s great to hear about another way of using that connection. april 18, 2019 3:12pm / reply emily l says... for burns – i swear by putting honey on it! my husband burned himself bad on the oven a few years ago and i quickly googled home remedies and found out that sometimes ice can actually make it worse. https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/health/19real.html april 18, 2019 3:09pm / reply aidan says... this is beauty!! april 18, 2019 2:33pm / reply nn says... love her blue striped shirt! where is it from?
