quite broad. really, it just means read a lot and constantly be learning. i believe education is life-long, and the best of it is often self-driven. to that end, i want to make sure i go through lots and lots of books! initially, one of my 2013 resolutions was to simply read one book a month. that would come to 12 books a year, which is more than i imagine most people read. however, i’ve decided to try and outdo myself, and am currently trying to read one a week (at least). still, the goal of one per month will stand, though i think i’ll have to up that significantly if i’m to reach 1000 before i die. if you want to follow my progress, follow me on goodreads!. you can also check out the list of books i recommend for all students. “a human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. specialization is for insects.” – robert heinlein if you found this list inspiring, i’d challenge you to create your own! if you’d like to put it online and make it public as i’ve done, you can check out my guide on how to build a website to get started. alternatively, you could keep it simple and just use a text document on your computer, or even a piece of paper (but remember to leave space for sub-goals!). more links about contact impossible list archive cig
