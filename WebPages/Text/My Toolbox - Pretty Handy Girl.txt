(this book is no longer in print, so look for used copies.) screwdriver bits: last but not least, the most indispensable tool i’ve ever owned: cordless drill with screwdriver bits and a small set of drill bits for electrical diy: wiring instruction book or guide wire cutters/strippers electrical current tester you only need the simple tester with two probes and an indicator light to test if the power is on. for the committed diyer: palm sander carpenter’s square staple gun power circular saw be sure to hold one in the store and feel how the grip feels in your hand. this is especially important as a woman with a smaller hand size. (more on power tool shopping in another blog post – coming soon!) jig saw saw horses or folding work bench clamps – a variety of adjustable clamps and clips miter saw i hope this list gives you some good information so you won’t feel overwhelmed when buying tools. definitely ask a sales person for help or opinions. don’t tell them you are new at this. ask them for the tool they would purchase if they were buying one for their shop. you should aim to buy a quality tool (especially power tools) that will last your lifetime. a cheap tool will either break or not have the power to do the job you need it to do. however, you don’t need to buy top of the line or break the bank to get a good tool. these are the tools that i own and love!
