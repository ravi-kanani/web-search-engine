this has been one of my most requested videos. my previous curly hair routine on how to wash and style curly hair is my most popular video of all time. to be honest my routine hasn’t changed that much in 3 years. i’m using a few different products but the method is similar. i truly believe that while products are amazing at helping your curls, the techniques are just as important to your curl results. it’s too hard to film in my shower at home, but if you really want to see a video of how i wash my hair, let me know and i’ll see what i can do. with this updated curly hair routine, i’ve included details of the products i recommend and how much to use as well which i hope you’ll find helpful. if you want to learn how to style your curls & 30 fun ways to wear your hair, you’ll love my ebook – 30 days of curly hairstyles. now i’m sure you’re ready see the video so here it is. my current curly hair routine video tutorial click here if you can’t see the video above my favourite products for curly hair shampoo and conditioner for this video i used the darshana shampoo and conditioner. i really love this range and their hair oil as well. you can find darshana online here and in australia here. hair treatments crucial to keeping my curly hair looking good are plex treatments. i’ve written a lot about plex treatments here and i love using olaplex no 3 or matrix bond 3. if your hair is healthy these probably aren’t necessary but if you do a lot of heat styling or colouring your hair i definitely recommend them. you can find olaplex here in australia or here in the usa. matrix bond is available in salon or online here. and this is the only comb i use in the shower – it’s the best. deep conditioning i love the shea moisture masks, especially the jamaican black castor oil masque because it gives my hair a really beautiful slip and helps tame any frizz while i’m still in the shower. the shea moisture masks are quite rich and can be heavy in fine hair. you may prefer to use a product like kinky curly knot today instead or just your regular conditioner. shea moisture is available here in australia or here in the usa. kinky curly knot today is available here in australia or here in the usa. curly styling products if you have been following me for a while, you’ll recognise thee products. i’m still using the shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie as a curl cream and then the taft mega styling gel to stop frizz from forming. this part of any curl routine can become the most complicated and i’ve got a future post coming on the different types of curl creams and when to use them. and if you have any questions about gel, check out this post on using gel in curly hair. shea moisture smoothie is available here in australia or here in the usa. taft gel is only available in australia but try this alternative for the usa. my hairdryer previously i have used the ghd air and the parlux hairdryers – both of which i still recommend as excellent pro hairdryers. but if your budget can stretch, the dyson really is far superior. the dyson diffuser is the best i have ever used and it takes under 10 minutes to dry my hair. it’s definitely an investment but for me, it’s worth it. you can find the dyson supersonic here in australia and here in the usa. finishing products to control that fluffiness at the end, i finish my hair with either oil or serum. for a long time i’ve loved the darshana hair oil and you really only need to use a drop of this. a new product i’ve been introduced to is the marc anthony bye bye frizz serum which is silicone free. you can find darshana online here or in australia it’s stocked here. marc anthony serum is available here in australia or in the usa here. while i don’t strictly follow the curly girl method, all the products i’ve featured do fit within the method. i wore these curls for just normal day but to amp up the volume, i would follow this big curls routine. sometimes curly hair routine videos actually raise more questions than answers so if there’s anything that you have a question about, please ask in the comments below. also tell me about your curly hair routine! i’m always curious what other curlies do and what products are your favourites. i’d love to see your hair if you try my routine, please tag me on instagram or use #hairromance so i can see you. you may also like... how to get volume in curly hair using clips quick and easy updo for curly hair filed under: curly hair, curly hairstyles, hair romance, tutorials « fake curls!

reply hair romance says may 27, 2019 at 10:49 pm hi angela, i do switch around a lot as i’m always testing new products. i chose darshana for this post though as it’s silicone free and sulphate free but still washes my hair really well and feels great. it’s a good all-rounder shampoo for sure and a lovely small business too. if i’m using a lot of silicone products, i normally use a regular schwarzkopf shampoo to remove any product buildup. hope this helps x reply suzanne says may 27, 2019 at 7:21 am hi there, really useful video, thanks! i am really keen to try some of the products that you use but am based in the uk. do you know of a uk alternative to the taft gel that you use? thanks x reply hair romance says may 27, 2019 at 10:51 pm thanks suzanne! sorry i didn’t include any uk links but i really recommend the boots own range. i bought some to test and the boots curl cream and boots hair gel are both total bargains. the gel can be hard to find instore as it’s amongst the men’s grooming but search it out as it’s great! x reply lulwa says july 23, 2019 at 7:02 am i live in africa (egypt) and i don’t know any good products here. would you maybe know anything i could buy? sorry for the trouble, and thanks in advance. reply shana says june 15, 2019 at 9:09 am i love this article. thank you for sharing your curly hair routine! #curlygirl xoxo reply hair romance says june 16, 2019 at 6:51 pm thanks shana! xx reply deanna says june 17, 2019 at 10:41 am do you rinse the masque or do you leave it in then apply the smoothie afterwards? thanks for the great video, its perfect timing as summer is here in florida and it it hot and humid 🙂 reply hair romance says june 17, 2019 at 7:45 pm hi deanna! thanks so much! i rinse the mask in the shower before applying the smoothie. let me know if you try any of my routine and how it works for your hair xx reply verbal_blowtorch says june 20, 2019 at 4:29 am i read the curly girl handbook and started following the method about a week and a half ago. i’m shampooing with raw curls every two or three days at the roots only; i condition with raw curls conditioner and rinse only lightly, leaving most of it in. then i apply a palm-full of la looks gel and scrunch with a t-shirt. i diffuse dry, because waiting for it to air dry is time i won’t get back at the end of life. before bed, i ‘pineapple’ it, so it’s not touching my face. what a tedious process, by the way. but my curls went from pure frizz to pure silky whirls. finally, i can wear my hair down instead of the frustration bun with a scrunchy i’ve been unhappily rocking for years. (i’m not good with styling. makeup, i can do — hair, i am just hopeless. “easy braid” tutorials might as well be quantum physics). but…there’s a stone-cold deal-breaker: since starting curly girl, my skin is trashed. i have always had good skin, even in my teens, and i’m meticulous about caring for it. now, there’s abundant acne everywhere my hair touches when worn loose. it’s like the universe saying: “oh, you figured out how to have nice hair? how adorable. now i’m reverting your overall attractiveness back to its established baseline by ruining your skin. …stop crying, you can’t have both!” reply cindy says january 27, 2020 at 3:23 am i’m sorry to hear about your acne breakouts now that you’ve figured out how to get hair you love. that truly sucks! and i can relate to your comment about hair styling as i, too, am hopeless- quantum physics braids is relatable. haha! i really hope you can sort out the problem skin created by your new hair routine. i have no experience to share but would suggest hitting curly forums to enquire- perhaps there are product suggestions that won’t contribute to acne. maybe cross reference the ingredients in your products to ingredients that are known to be comedogenic and avoid products with those ingredients. best of luck reply jack says june 29, 2019 at 7:00 pm thanks so much christina! i’m a 17 year old kiwi male with fairly curly shoulder length dark brown hair with blonde highlights at the end and you’ve been incredibly helpful. i’ve only recently found out how curly my hair actually is and i’m trying to embrace it! reply hair romance says july 4, 2019 at 6:13 am thanks so much, jack! really glad i could help 🙂 reply kelly says september 14, 2019 at 4:58 am your routine has made a big difference for me, thank you! however, i read that you say a good stylist and the right cut is key. do you have a description of your haircut? what is your stylist doing for your curly hair that is key? i’ve had so many wrong things done to my hair over the years that i completely understand what you mean, but haven’t found anyone to execute a good cut. reply hair romance says september 14, 2019 at 1:58 pm thanks kelly! i think layering really helps curly hair to set better and at the moment i get long layers and face framing layers but in the past i had a v-shape or u-shape cut. i’ve got a post about haircuts for curly hair here xx reply julie says february 23, 2020 at 2:02 pm hi, loving everything you do here. what settings do you use on your dyson? reply hair romance says march 10, 2020 at 9:15 pm thank you! i use medium heat & speed when i diffuse x reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed. hair romance – love your hair hi, i'm christina and welcome to hair romance. here you’ll find tutorials, tips and beauty advice to help you to love your best accessory: your hair. find out more here... search hair romance shop hair romance learn how to braid your own hair, style your curls and have new hairstyles every day with hair romance's ebooks. archives archives select month march 2020 january 2020 december 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 shopbop.com fast free shipping worldwide just arrived shop sleepwear tops shop buttondown fast free shipping worldwide just arrived chinti and parker eccentric sweater dress kule shop kule the samara cashmere sweater herschel supply co. buy it here < > shop sleepwear tops wildfox wildfox collection wildfox heart wildfox cupid cloudy sky pajama legging... juicy couture camisole at shopbop < > shop buttondown the great. the great. the puff sleeve button up shirt frank & eileen love this outfit ayr the burst button down at shopbop < > shop sweater cardigans, casual white maxi dresses, gold pumps shoes, printed pants and more. get this widget. hair romance all information copyright hair romance™ 2010-2020. hair romance is a registered trademark. quick links home about 30 days of curly hairstyles 30 hairstyles in 30 days 30 braids in 30 days 30 buns in 30 days advertise contact contact email: thehair[at]hairromance[dot]com mail: po box 1288, darlinghurst nsw 1300 twitter: @hairromance instagram: @hairromance copyright christina butcher 2020
