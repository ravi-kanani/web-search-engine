nyu makes face shield design for healthcare workers that can be built in under a minute available to all darrell etherington @etherington / 12 hours new york university is among the many academic, private and public institutions doing what it can to address the need for personal protective equipment (ppe) among healthcare workers across the world. the school worked quickly to develop an open-source face-shield design, and is now offering that design freely to any and all in order to help scale manufacturing to meet needs. face shields are a key piece of equipment for front-line healthcare workers operating in close contact with covid-19 patients. they’re essentially plastic, transparent masks that extend fully to cover a wearer’s face. these are to be used in tandem with n95 and surgical masks, and can protect a healthcare professional from exposure to droplets containing the virus expelled by patients when they cough or sneeze. the nyu project is one of many attempts to scale production of face masks, but many others rely on 3d printing. this has the advantage of allowing even very small commercial 3d-print operations and individuals to contribute, but 3d printing takes a lot of time — roughly 30 minutes to an hour per print. nyu’s design requires only basic materials, including two pieces of clear, flexible plastic and an elastic band, and it can be manufactured in less than a minute by essentially any production facility that includes equipment for producing flat products (whole punches, laser cutters, etc.). this was designed in collaboration with clinicians, and over 100 of them have already been distributed to emergency rooms. nyu’s team plans to ramp production of up to 300,000 of these once they have materials in hand at the factories of production partners they’re working with, which include daedalus design and production, prg scenic technologies and showman fabricators. now, the team is putting the design out there for pubic use, including a downloadable tool kit so that other organizations can hopefully replicate what they’ve done and get more into circulation. they’re also welcoming inbound contact from manufacturers who can help scale additional production capacity. other initiatives are working on different aspects of the ppe shortage, including efforts to build ventilators and extend their use to as many patients as possible. it’s a great example of what’s possible when smart people and organizations collaborate and make their efforts available to the community, and there are bound to be plenty more examples like this as the covid-19 crisis deepens.
