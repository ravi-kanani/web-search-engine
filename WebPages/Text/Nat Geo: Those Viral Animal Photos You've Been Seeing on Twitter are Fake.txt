just watch out for the gradiated red header and yellow kicker box, with no media branding. https://t.co/7djkfwe43b — picpedant (@picpedant) march 12, 2020 of course, not all animal stories are fake, but the most “hopeful” or funny or outrageous—the ones that make you want to hit share—all seem to be made up or at the very least misleading. the impacts of human social distancing and the massive drop in tourism on the animal kingdom has mostly been neutral, sometimes bad. as reported by the new york times, the deer in nara, japan are indeed leaving their home in the park and roaming mostly-empty streets and subways, because the tourists who used to feed them in nara park are no longer there. less tourists in nara = less people feeding the deer in the parks 🌷🌱 now they're venturing out into the city eating flowers and plants, per fuji tv #coronavirus#新型コロナウイルス の影響で海外観光客の減少が続く奈良公園で、鹿せんべいをもらえなくなってしまったシカちゃん達 😢 pic.twitter.com/yufwj4s9sj — kurumi mori (@rumireports) march 6, 2020 and this video of a hoard of monkeys in thailand fighting over food also seems to be legitimate: as tourism to the country’s phra prang sam yot monkey temple in lopburi drops, the macaques have been brawling in larger numbers and more violently than normal, because food is more scarce. the lesson here is one that most photographers learned long ago: you can’t always trust photography on social media. normally, we report on viral photoshop creations, or fake “debunking” photos that try to make photojournalists look bad, or fake (and stolen) photos used to send a political message. unfortunately, the (dubiously attributed) mark twain quote that “a lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on,” is just as true of fake photos, and fake photo captions. so while we would love for the dolphins or the drunk elephants to be true, it’s important to separate fact from fiction, lest the public lose faith in all photography, all the time. tags: animalphotos, coronavirus, covid, covid19, debunked, debunking, dolphins, elephants, fake, fakephotos, lions, myth, nationalgeographic, socialdistancing, swans, viral share tweet 0 please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus. prev impressive drone shot of lounging seals wins nature ttl photo contest next ep. 334: exposure bucks don’t buy toilet paper – and more trending posts photos of the robots living among us mar 25, 2020 sony spins off camera business into separate company mar 26, 2020 adobe is giving everyone 2 months of free creative cloud — here’s how to get it mar 18, 2020 a boston event photographer shares her story of contracting covid-19 mar 24, 2020 21 portrait photography lessons from 21 great photographers mar 25, 2020 nat geo: those viral animal photos you’ve been seeing on twitter are fake mar 24, 2020 the library of fake ‘travel photos’ in asia mar 24, 2020 photographer died protecting his film during the 1980 mt. st. helens eruption sep 07, 2011 ilford: stockpile rolls of film, not toilet paper mar 25, 2020 70 inspirational quotes for photographers may 29, 2014 polaroid originals reclaims ‘polaroid’ name, unveils polaroid now camera mar 26, 2020 drone photos of singapore shot at 1,640 feet mar 23, 2020 i used my drone to take fun portraits of people in self-isolation 7 hours ago nikon z vs nikon d: a comparison mar 24, 2020 portraits in the time of coronavirus: shooting free front porch photo sessions mar 25, 2020 the supreme court just decided that states cannot be sued for copyright infringement mar 23, 2020 how to turn your bedroom into a giant camera and use it to make pictures mar 24, 2020 eerie drone footage of an empty san francisco during quarantine mar 26, 2020 adobe offers students free at-home access to creative cloud apps amid coronavirus closures mar 13, 2020 this obstacle avoiding drone is so fast it can play dodgeball mar 25, 2020 archives news gear inspiration tutorials reviews archives podcast copyright © 2020 petapixel subscribe our newsletter to stay up to date 500 k 1 m
