'refusal will result in a racial discrimination note being attached to your child's education record, which will remain on this file throughout their school career' i have only one thing to add to this telegraph blog post by daniel hannan. it is this: i am glad that mr hannan and other newspapers have not followed the usual timid practice when reporting stories of this type and obscured the name of the culprit. a storm of public anger is about the only weapon we have against the likes of mrs l small, head teacher of littleton green community school, colliers way, huntingdon, south staffordshire ws12 4ud. and if "our r.e. coordinator mrs edmonds", she being the one with whom parents are invited to "discuss this further", does not wish to join her boss in the stocks, she should direct her further discussion towards disassociating herself from the literally fascist tactics mrs small uses. the l stands for "lynn", by the way. lynn small, head teacher of littleton green community school, the one who coerces parents by threatening to harm their eight year old children. posted by natalie at 11:13 pm loving the aussies even more at first i thought that tim blair's account of the outrageous behaviour of the australian delegates to the warsaw un climate conference was written for laughs. i duly laughed. then i followed the links. it's all true; the snacks ... the t-shirts ... the pyjamas. then of course my laughter was replaced by profound sorrow at the disgrace brought upon a once-respected nation by its so-called representatives*. *while acknowledging the limited validity of concerns about health and safety of delegates in late night negotiations. posted by natalie at 11:04 pm thursday, november 21, 2013 the superior virtue of the oppressed it’s no coincidence the mps found guilty of fiddling are all labour, writes peter oborne. the book can at last be closed on the daily telegraph investigation into the mps’ expenses scandal. more than 300 members of parliament have paid back wrongly claimed expenses. several of the worst offenders have stood down from parliament. now that the former minister denis macshane has at last pleaded guilty to fraud, no further prosecutions are planned, and all criminal investigation is reported to have ceased. but one puzzling question remains. why is it that only labour mps have been found guilty of expenses fraud as a result of the telegraph revelations? his argument that there is "only one chance in 64 that labour’s score of 6/6 was a coincidence" should be saved as an awful example for the probability chapter in a gcse mathematics textbook, with calculation of the precise odds that he has let the tories off far too lightly left as an exercise for the student. this part of his explanation, however, is accurate: it is especially perplexing because the party in general strongly feels itself to be the embodiment of decency and morality. indeed labour has always insisted that the conservatives are the party of venality, greed and selfishness. how baffling it is, then, that only labour mps have been sent to jail as a result of the telegraph revelations. paradoxically, i believe that it is labour’s belief in its own higher morality – what bertrand russell called the “superior virtue of the oppressed” – that has led to its downfall. many labour people cannot believe that anything done by the oppressed classes or their champions can ever really be wrong, not when there are bullingdon-educated toffs who were in the eton club out there for comparison. the jailed mps and their supporters know in their hearts that their very sentences are part of the oppression. they take comfort as the prison gates clang behind them from the thought that when they hear that sound they join the company of heroes. stanley kurtz described a similar persecution envy burning in the breasts of greens and climate change activists in the wannabe oppressed: what do america’s college students want? they want to be oppressed. more precisely, a surprising number of students at america’s finest colleges and universities wish to appear as victims — to themselves, as well as to others — without the discomfort of actually experiencing victimization. here is where global warming comes in. the secret appeal of campus climate activism lies in its ability to turn otherwise happy, healthy, and prosperous young people into an oppressed class, at least in their own imaginings. climate activists say to the world, “i’ll save you.” yet deep down they’re thinking, “oppress me.” and deeper yet, "oppress me a little bit so that i can resist you with visible heroism safe in the knowledge that you will not actually hurt me." posted by natalie at 1:02 pm wednesday, november 20, 2013

allies by mistake. in a video posted on youtube, fighters affiliated to the islamic state of iraq and syria (isis) were pictured holding up the head of a bearded man before a crowd in aleppo, claiming that he was an iraqi shia fighting for president assad. several people recognised the dead man and isis began an internal investigation and confirmed that the dead man was probably muhammad fares, a

worth knowing about: police tried to spy on cambridge students, secret footage shows officer is filmed attempting to persuade activist in his 20s to become informant targeting 'student-union type stuff' of this sort of thing is not new. a friend of mine was asked to spy on far-left groups back in the '70s. perhaps it is inevitable; among the innumerable sects that split and reformed and split again to become the rcpbml and cpgb(ml) we all know and love this week, there were a few that really did need spying on, as do some of the muslims who have replaced them. but "student-union type stuff"? yup, mi5 really needs a deep cover mole in the the suts. and were they always such cheapskates? the officer also suggested the man he hoped to recruit would be paid expenses or other sums. "you might go to a uk uncut or unite against fascism meeting one evening, you might get say £30 just for your time and effort for doing that. that's the sort of thing you are looking at." posted by natalie at 6:22 pm samizdata quote of the day if you don’t own your own body, i shudder to think of the implications of the tragedy of the commons. - commenter "charles austin", here. read about those implications here. the mills of incentives grind slow but they grind exceeding small. posted by natalie at 6:20 pm sunday, november 10, 2013 on this day let us commemorate... ... the victims of the french revolution. today is 20th brumaire in the year ccxxii. on this day in in year two, 10th november 1793 in the former calendar, the festival of reason was inaugurated in the temple of reason, before and afterwards known as the cathedral of notre dame. when reading his description of the first festival modern readers may find it difficult to share the outrage expressed by the highly partisan nineteenth century politician and historian of the french revolution, denounced alike by carlyle and marx, adolphe thiers. the catholic church under the ancien régime was oppressive and parasitical, and the festival can seem to modern eyes like nothing much worse than an embarrassingly amateur charity pageant run by the women's institute: the first festival of reason was held with pomp on the 20th of brumaire (10th of november) it was attended by all the sections, together with the constituted authorities. a young woman represented the goddess of reason. she was the wife of momoro, the printer, one of the friends of vincent, bonsin, chaumette, hebert, and the like. she was dressed in a white drapery; a mantle of azure blue hung from her shoulders ; her flowing hair was covered with the cap of liberty. she sat upon an antique seat, intwined with ivy and borne by four citizens. young girls dressed in white, and crowned with roses, preceded and followed the goddess. then came the busts of lepelletier and marat, musicians, troops, and all the armed sections. speeches were delivered, and hymns sung in the temple of reason ; they then proceeded to the convention, and chaumette spoke in these terms : "legislators ! fanaticism has given way to reason. its bleared eyes could not endure the brilliancy of the light. this day an immense concourse has assembled beneath those grothic vaults, which, for the first time, re-echoed the truth. there the french have celebrated the only true worship, that of liberty, that of reason. there we have formed wishes for the prosperity of the arms of the republic. there we have abandoned inanimate idols for reason, for that animated image, the masterpiece of nature." as he uttered these words, chaumette pointed to the living goddess of reason. whatever the semblance, nothing about the french revolution was harmless. the goddess reason ascended her throne two months into the terror. when the catholic peasants of the vendée were so ungrateful for the blessings of the goddess as to attempt counter-revolution, momoro, the man whose wife had played the role of the goddess, was deeply involved in its brutal suppression. chaumette, too, was one of the leading enragés, and soppy modern "liberals" inclined to praise the cult of reason as an ancestor of their own views might like to read more about its teachings regarding women. neither momoro nor chaumette had long to enjoy their status as founders. by spring of the next year robespierre decided to replace the cult of reason with the cult of the supreme being. from then on it was the people's front of judea scene from life of brian with real deaths. the committee of public safety sent momoro to the guillotine on 24th march 1794 and chaumette followed him on 15th april. robespierre himself fell from power in june and was guillotined in july. a few paragraphs later thiers describes "restraints" being imposed on a people that he thought were unprecedented in all prior history. they were not, alas, unrepeated in subsequent history: if then we survey the state of france at this period, we shall see that never were more restraints imposed at once on that inert and patient part of the population on which political experiments are made. people dared no longer express any opinion. they were afraid to visit their friends, lest they might be compromised with them, and lose liberty and even life. a hundred thousand arrests and some hundreds of condemnations, rendered imprisonment and the scaffold ever present to the minds of twenty-five millions of french. they had to bear heavy taxes. if, by a perfectly arbitrary classification, they were placed on the list of the rich, they lost for that year a portion of their income. sometimes, at the requisition of a representative or of some agent or other, they were obliged to give up their crops, or their most valuable effects in gold and silver. they durst no longer display any luxury, or indulge in noisy pleasures. they were no longer permitted to use metallic money, but obliged to take and give a depreciated paper, with which it was difficult to procure such things as they needed. they were forced, if shopkeepers, to sell at a fictitious price, if buyers, to put up with the worst commodities, because the best shunned the maximum and the assignats : sometimes, indeed, they had to do without either, because good and bad were alike concealed. they had but one sort of black bread, common to the rich as to the poor, for which they were obliged to contend at the doors of the bakers, after waiting for several hours. lastly, the names of the weights and measures, the names of the months and days, were changed ; there were but three sundays instead of four ; and the women and the aged men were deprived of those religious ceremonies which they had been accustomed to attend all their lives. it was a straight road from revolutionary france to soviet russia, but if you look carefully the twisty paths from there to nearly all the "political experiments" and other horrors of the twentieth century can be discerned, including the two great wars remembered today. posted by natalie at 6:18 pm home
