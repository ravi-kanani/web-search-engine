✹ glyn on 28 dec 2006 • link what clerks did at the navy office. several decades after the diary, and no doubt incorporating his improvements, this is what a senior financial clerk's working week was like in 1748: john russell held the post of "extra commissioner" there in 1748: "on mondays: collect and abstract all bills of exchange, yards and all navy bills for the week past, and examine the same with the comptroller of the treasurer's account. tuesday examine all invalids and sign their tickets for payment [by the 'chatham chest']. wednesday: all day at the pay office. thursday: with the comptroller receiving petions of poor seamen run on ships' books, and relieving such as appear just. and examine the transport accounts ... all in my office. friday, all day at the pay office. saturday: examine all imprest and contingent accounts for the week. and attend the board every night to dispatch orders and letters till 9 o'clock. and you know besides all this, that i am at calls [i.e. to pay off a ship when it arrives home], wherever a commissioner is wanted; am just come from woolwich paying off the "rainbow"." - letter written 21 december, 1748. pepys was more senior than this, of course, but this was what his senior clerks would have had to do as well. you'll note that the board met regularly in the evenings up until 9 pm. ✹ bill on 17 nov 2014 • link the garden at the navy office. sue nicholson. http://www.pepysdiary.com/indepth/2014/03/02/navy… ✹ martin bond on 23 feb 2015 • link navy office, seething lane. http://www.londonremembers.com/subjects/navy-offi… ✹ john york on 12 sep 2015 • link brian, the wikipedia entry for crutched friars will answer your questions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crutched_friars whilst your contention of the name derivation could be correct, it is suggested that they were named from a crutch or staff that the carried with them. "they settled in london in 1249, where they gave their name to the locality, near tower hill, still called crutched friars." log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register
