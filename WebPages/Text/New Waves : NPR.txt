(it was closer to five times, but i didn&;t correct her.) today, she wasn&;t paying. today, she only wanted retribution. margo had been stewing on ways to get back at nimbus during her first three drinks. she already had a plan. &;what is any company&;s most valuable asset?&; she asked. &;its&;.&;.&;.&;money?&; &;no, lucas, what&;s more valuable than money?&; this sounded like a trick question. &;code?&; &;no, its information,&; margo said. &;and that&;s what we&;re going to take.&; &;isn&;t that stealing?&; margo pointed her beer at me. &;what about copying it?&; this was her proposal: nimbus was a messaging service with millions of users. we would take their user database. margo could easily access, duplicate, and download it. the whole thing would only take a few minutes. we would just take emails. no passwords, no personal information. &;why would anyone want a list of email addresses?&; &;millions of email addresses,&; margo clarified. &;any company would kill for a list of people using a competitor&;s product.&; &;why?&; &;for marketing, or whatever.&; margo gestured at nothing in particular, like she&;d just performed the world&;s saddest magic trick. she casually mentioned that she knew someone who worked at phantom, nimbus&;s biggest competitor. it was their ceo. maybe they&;d be interested in it. &;it&;s a bad idea,&; i said. &;it&;s immoral. it&;s wrong.&; &;in what way is this immoral or wrong?&; &;because we&;re taking something that doesn&;t belong to us.&; &;lucas, listen to me.&; margo looked me straight in the eye. &;nothing belongs to us.&; it was the way she said &;us.&; did she mean as employees of nimbus? as suckers in a world that advantaged the wealthy? as two people who weren&;t white in america? just me and her? it didn&;t matter. the truth was that margo had already decided, and i was three beers behind and playing catchup. but i had logistical questions, ones that she had anticipated and spent those three beers considering. there would be some very light encryption on the user data, but every engineer had access to it. this was a common problem at startups. when you start with a small team of engineers, none of them are dedicated to security. the goal is to build something as quickly as possible, so nobody gets hired to protect user privacy. even as a startup grows large and stable enough to support a security team, it&;s already been deprioritized from the start. i was still skeptical. &;and there&;s no way for them to trace it back to us?&; &;there might be a log of it. but if they pursue us, they would be admitting that there was a breach.&; margo had a mind for systems. and to her, every system was vulnerable if you understood the incentives of the people who built it. she could disassemble and reassemble anything, including the hubris of men. a security breach would be a publicity nightmare for nimbus, and for the people who ran the company. margo knew she could exploit their greatest fear: embarrassment. it was strange that a company&;s reputation for security was more important than its actual security. but having worked at nimbus for the past year&;my first job in any kind of real workplace, much less a tech company&;it didn&;t surprise me. no person should ever trust that their personal information is going to be protected by a company. the place was managed by a mixture of twentysomethings with little work experience and a handful of computer-illiterate adults brought in to babysit them. the office space was generic, but it had been dolled up with brightly colored furniture and some tacky movie posters, all for the sake of reinforcing the &;fun&; work environment. the kitchen had free snacks and a beer tap. action figures and nerf guns were scattered across people&;s desks. there was a conference room dedicated to video games. apparently investors loved these things. they&;d tour the office every few months and take stock of the ways nimbus physically embodied the tired notion that everyone could work hard and play hard, even if that meant the office looked like an eight-year-old&;s playroom. all of the tasteless interior decorating choices were, at least, harmless and easy to ignore. but the office centered around the foosball table. people would play in the middle of the workday, and the sounds carried throughout the floor&;four sweaty men grunting and hollering. margo joked that, from a distance, foosball looked like four men jerking off into a box. no one ever asked margo and me to play foosball. not that we would&;ve said yes. &;we&;ll find new jobs somewhere better,&; margo said. &;somewhere less f***ed.&; &;what tech company is less f***ed?&; &;i don&;t know. maybe i just&;.&;.&;.&;move to tokyo. start over on the other side of the world.&; &;why tokyo? you don&;t even like leaving new york city&;.&;.&;.&; &;lucas, the point is that we should do something different,&; she said, &;that we can do something different.&; i didn&;t actively hate our workplace the way margo did. it was a job, after all. but in a place where i had no love for my coworkers and no love for the office, margo&;s vigor was contagious. &;nobody at nimbus cares about you,&; she said. &;except me.&; read & listen home news arts & life music podcasts programs connect newsletters facebook twitter instagram contact help about npr overview finances people press public editor corrections get involved support public radio sponsor npr npr careers npr shop npr events visit npr terms of use privacy your privacy choices text only npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none" src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621557368158968&ev=pageview&noscript=1" />
