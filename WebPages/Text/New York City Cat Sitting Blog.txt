he was not having it, but liz, a very dear soul and outstanding vet tech in the area (words really can not describe her cat whispering abilities) came over the next day and gave him fluids in his home. she put the needle in and he proceeded to get up, so i held the fluid bag and she followed him around the apartment ensuring the needle wouldn’t fall out. success!! upon barbara’s return, liz taught barbara how to administer the fluids to iggy, and they established a routine on the bed, with treats and all. never in a million years did i think that iggy would be able to stay home for fluid treatment. again, i thought i was dreaming, especially after i was able to give him fluids the next time barbara left town. i believe the shock of learning that your furry baby has kidney disease could be devastating. i have experienced this first hand with my baby girl rosie. and on top of that discovery, quite often your vet recommends fluid treatment at home. ‘okay, doc, you are suggesting that i stick a needle in my own cat to administer fluids? can’t i just encourage her to drink more water? i’m going to hurt her and there is no way i can do this alone.’ i must interject here, fearful cat person. you can do this! i have worked with all sorts of people, young, older, timid, aggressive, passive, intense – and with one or 2 exceptions, every single one of these cat lovers has successfully learned to give her cat fluids. your vet’s staff will give you the basic tutorial on how to carry out this new, seemingly daunting task. and, like with everything else in the world, there are tricks to the trade. i offer my students of fluid administration tips and tricks for doing this quite efficiently, with little or no struggle from their felines. there are ways of ensuring the flow is quick and steady and there are positions for the cat and locations in the home that work best. fluid administration, along with diet and chemical element management, can be priceless factors in managing kidney disease in cats. if your cat is diagnosed with kidney disease, please consider following the protocol for treatment from your vet. i know it has prolonged the lives (with quality) of many, many cats, and have had firsthand experience with the delay of the progression of this common feline disease. do you need help in learning how to administer fluids to your feline baby? please don’t hesitate to contact me. most importantly, we would love to hear your success stories and insight relating to your experiences with administering fluids to your cats. let’s help those that are understandably hesitant and frightened to overcome this obstacle. 2118 commentshttp%3a%2f%2fwww.newyorkcitycatsittingblog.com%2f211%2fadministering+subcutaneous+fluids+to+your+cat+-+you+can+do+this%212010-05-04+00%3a47%3a29adminhttp%3a%2f%2fwww.newyorkcitycatsittingblog.com%2f%3fp%3d211 tagged in arnold plotnick dvm, chronic renal failure in cats, crf and cats, fluid therapy for cats, manhattan cat specialists, subcutaneous fluids older posts » subscribe to our rss feed recent comments admin on lola the rescue cat and new york city animal care and control kimsimon77 on lola the rescue cat and new york city animal care and control onallfourscat on cat sitting on a thankful thursday onallfourscat on lola the rescue cat and new york city animal care and control onallfourscat on bobby the very handsome feline categories 24 hour cat care andy the cat animal rescue animal welfare cat adoption cat care cat diseases cat diseases and treatment cat sitting cat sitting clients cat vets cats and art company diabetic cats emergency cat care feeding cats great products nyc animal care and control on all fours cat sitting pet sitting re-homing cats senior cats thankful thursday vet care veterinarians recent posts rescue – (to free from confinement, danger, or evil : save, deliver) – one cat at a time lola the rescue cat and new york city animal care and control a special gift from a cat sitting client us cats are back!
