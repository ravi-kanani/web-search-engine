(from this interesting comparison of italy with south korea, h/t instapundit.) how very sad that italy evidently lacks any pool of state employees whose ordinary tasks could be deferred or done with fewer people, so they could be used to trace contacts while doctors treated patients. how very fortunate that in the uk, we have an overstaffed bureaucracy in many offices of the administration. as doctors will be very busy in coming months on tasks that need their skills, and police busy enough (to defer policing speech? – if only!) and the army perhaps busy if new facilities must be quickly built, the government should immediately give itself the power to allocate up to half the bureaucrats in any state office to the task of tracing the contacts of the infected, requiring the others to step up as needed to keep any essential tasks going (some offices of course, like cruise liners, could go into mothballs pro tem). i despise pc talking heads who demonstrate (yet again) that they see a crisis as just a terrible thing to waste, so would not wish us to imitate them. does anyone see a problem with my suggestion, considered strictly as a way of addressing the upcoming issue better than italy has?

in the uk’s past, the rising of the very-recently deceased from the morgue, of the ill from their sickbeds and of the politically inactive from their slumber was only a very localised problem, but as parts of the us are not the only foreign culture from which dead voters could immigrate with the living, i hope our new government will keep more of an eye on things than past ones have done – especially when our politically-correct media avert theirs. march 3rd, 2020 | 27 comments how would she know?

how could they imagine that anything so solid might conceivably disappear? their roads grew better as their statesmanship grew worse and central heating triumphed as civilization fell.” (eileen power essay on the fall of the roman empire, written in the winter of 1938-9.) “history does not repeat itself, but it sometimes rhymes.” (attributed to mark twain) it happened in thessalonika near the end of the roman empire. the empire had been in trouble for some time. it was not reproducing itself – “the human harvest was bad” (seeley). ‘agri deserti’ – once-cultivated lands now abandoned for lack of people to till them – could be found in every province. internally, the empire tried its usual solution: more government, more laws, more force. legislation to reward large families and tax bachelors was kept on the statute books for centuries although “successful it was not” (power). as the empire waned, laws to deal with the consequence of this failure were added: binding cultivators to the soil (the origin of serfdom) was merely the most common example of assigning a hereditary obligation to more and more of the professions the state relied on as soon as a shortfall appeared in them, legally punishing any son who did not follow in his father’s footsteps. to draft and regulate these laws, the numbers and privileges of bureaucrats ballooned from rome’s former proportion (though still small by our standards). successful all these laws were not – so, externally, the empire addressed its chronic shortage of manpower by immigration, to dose it with barbarian vigour. just a small injection to begin with and then more and more goths arrived, first as recruits to roman army units, then as foederate units under their own leaders, growing like a cancer within the armed forces until an egyptian mother quite naturally wrote the emperor to return her citizen son who “has gone off with the barbarians” – by which she meant he had joined the ‘roman’ army. emperor theodosius made the goths obey him, but his was an insecure authority over them. he used gothic troops in battles where pyrrhic victories may have been welcome. as one summary of the costly victory of frigidius (394 ad) puts it, the loss of 10,000 goths cannot have distressed theodosius unduly. theodosius also had little choice but to use some of their leaders as governors. mostly, the empire’s soldiers were also its police – so the leaders of those who were now increasingly providing those soldiers had to be both rewarded by, and used in, such posts. thus did butheric the goth became governor (magister militum) over illyricum, which included thessalonika. the urban elite of thessalonika were university-educated greeks. it would be hard to imagine an education less suited to help them understand the dangers they faced. the study of rhetoric, its links with reality long severed, … so eileen power described the ‘learned’ of the dying roman world. (today, 8 decades after she wrote those sentences, it is easier to imagine an education even less suited to helping elite intellectuals understand the dangers facing them, one whose links with reality are even more completely severed.) in the empire’s second century, hadrian had dispersed those jews he did not kill around the empire, confident they’d soon lose their primitive prejudices and assimilate to being broad-minded graeco-roman intellectuals like himself. fourth/fifth century graeco-roman intellectuals thought the same of the immigrants. sidonius appolinaris wrote a ‘good-natured’ description of the “embarrassing friendliness” of the new barbarian neighbours he encountered on a fifth-century visit to lyons: “how can he be expected to compose six-foot metres”, [sidonius] asks, “with so many seven-foot patrons all around him, all singing and all expecting him to admire their uncouth stream of non-latin words.” the shrug of the shoulders, the genial contempt of one conscious of an infinite superiority – how familiar it all seems. perhaps the thessalonikan city leaders greeted their new governor in this spirit, as sure as hadrian was about the jews that this uncouth goth would soon lose his barbaric prejudices. there was in thessalonika a popular charioteer. as ganymede was charioteer to the god zeus and also his catamite, so the thessalonikan charioteer had strong wrists on the race track and ganymede’s tastes in the bedroom. on the one hand, knowing graeco-roman culture of the time, there is nothing remotely surprising in the idea that the charioteer abused slaves, minors or other victims worse than some hollywood celebrity of our day (butheric accused him of assaulting a cupbearer). on the other hand, knowing the culture of the goths in such matters, same-sex liaisons that were as consenting-adults-only as the sternest metoo advocate could demand might still have disgusted a goth. the sophisticated thessalonikans were at least as disgusted with their governor. if this uncultured goth had not yet cured himself of his vile homophobia, had not yet been assimilated to their superior way of thinking, he could at least avoid displaying it in public. the governor refused to back down. it might be he was very opinionated in such matters even for a fourth-century goth. it might be he indeed knew there was a real abused victim in this particular case. or maybe he was like many a governor then and now – challenging his authority only made him the more determined to assert it. the thessalonikans refused to back down. maybe they were genuine advocates for sexual liberty (or for the taking of sexual liberties). maybe they were full of gothophobic prejudice (despite – or perhaps because of – the imperial government’s formal endorsement of these rapidly multiplying gothic immigrants, there was plenty of it about). or maybe they were infuriated at the way their gothic governor treated the elaborate expensively-learned rhetorical style of their addresses to him as artificial, boring and silly. whatever the reason, they cancel-cultured butheric all right – they killed him. (gibbon notes, as the empire died, “the cruel absurdity of the roman princes, unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence” but it would seem thessalonika’s civilians were not forbidden to carry knives.) perhaps precisely because of the tensions in his relationship with the goths, theodosius had a tetchy first reaction to news of this. by the time the less stern commands of his cooler second thoughts reached thessalonika, some 7,000 thessalonikan aficionados of chariot racing were as dead as their late governor. we know about this – just barely enough to part-reconstruct, part-guess the rest as i have described above (in anachronistic terms) – because of what happened next. saint ambrose banned the emperor from receiving christian communion until he repented his violence to the thessalonikans. theodosius yielded and did public penance. he also proclaimed a law: imperial orders for mass slaughter were not to be carried out until after 30 days had elapsed – just in case the emperor calmed down again. (whether butheric’s gothic soldiers-cum-police would have paid attention to it is another matter.) theodosius was the very last emperor to rule from the british midlands to the nile cataracts. in the fifth century, as the empire disintegrated, the educated graeco-roman elite acquired the familiar figure of orosius, explaining that the roman empire was founded in blood and conquest, so could ill-afford to throw stones at the barbarians. instead he advised: “if the unhappy people they have despoiled will content themselves with the little that is left them, their conquerors will cherish them like friends and brothers.” in the end, the rudely-awakened sidonius did not find it so, though he did survive and even got freed from captivity – by composing a panegyric for his particular barbarian conqueror. however the confident so-superior intellectual of earlier years doesn’t seem to have felt too pleased about it: “o necessitas abjecta nascendi, vivendi misera, dura moriendi!” [o humiliating necessity of birth, sad necessity of living, hard necessity of dying!] so much for ancient history. i cannot exactly tell you that “those who do not remember history are condemned to relive it” after telling you that history does not repeat itself, it only sometimes rhymes or merely echoes. what was done in rotherham is eclipsed by what goths did between the battle of adrianople and theodosius regaining tenuous control over them, just as the total of british dead from jihadi terror is eclipsed by the dead of that battle alone. but there could be rhymes. imagine an inner-city labour-appointed london magistrate who thinks sharia-law has insight in such matters confronting a bunch of university-credentialled (but hardy, in any flattering sense, educated) intellectuals without intellects (also labour-voting). avoiding islamophobia can trump acting or preaching against quertyphobia, but at other pc intersections echoes of thessalonikan confrontations can be dimly heard. the best way to avoid rhymes is to hear distant echoes while they are still distant (my less emphatic version of “those who do not remember history are condemned to relive it”). if only political correctness did not deafen us. 🙁 february 26th, 2020 | 10 comments how the quality of mercy is strained niall kilmartin (stirling) · administrative · evil empire prosecutorial discretion is a power jealously protected by prosecutors, who will tell stories about forgoing prosecution of 18-year-old guys for “rape” of their 17-year-old girlfriends, of not prosecuting people for technicalities when the equities demanded they violate those technicalities. it all sounds so decent and commonsensical. that’s how people like epstein go forever in safety, how clinton escaped prosecution for the same acts that put others in prison regularly, how the jussie smollets of the world walk away from their troubles . . . you don’t need to be that well connected to benefit. bobby b, commenter of this parish, worked for a time as a criminal defence lawyer in the twin cities of minneapolis / st. paul. in my relatively short crimdef career, i asked prosecutors to use that kind of discretion many times. it worked for the judge’s kid, for the cop, and for two staffers of the st. paul city councilperson. they were the only ones deserving of the city/county attorneys’ mercy. we’ve seen the us department of justice exercise a lot of ‘discretion‘ recently (and not so recently). bobby warns us that this bit of the deep state runs a lot deeper than that. (after ‘discretion’ finally ran out for him, i assume it was a different but liaising bit of the deep state who arranged that one fine day in the middle of the night the ‘forever’ safe epstein suddenly expired in his ‘guarded’, ‘suicide-watched’ cell.) february 15th, 2020 | 19 comments on the bbc, persons of no appearance attack jews in new york niall kilmartin (stirling) · deleted by the pc media · north american affairs in may, i wrote: “the attacks, and the silence of progressive new york, are utterly appalling.” in december, it’s more than appalling. it’s complicit. (karol markowicz) to say that today’s bbc broadcast reports of the latest attacks in new york pivoted swiftly to denouncing generalised “racism and homophobia” in the age of trump might be called an exaggeration – since to pivot, one must first be pointing in a different direction. but arguably that is unfair, and the beeb’s afternoon and evening news broadcasts did indeed merely swiftly pivot to a more acceptable talking point. certain omissions, hinted at in this post’s title, assisted that pivot. how far the bbc is on the same complicit page as against how far they are just unwisely still treating their progressive american friends as trustworthy and sufficient sources of insight, i do not know. my impression was that the beeb covered corbyn’s little problem in this area a bit less absurdly than what i saw today. it is easier to fool uk viewers about the us than about the uk – and some beeboids do seem to be trying. i should note that a hint of appearance did appear on the bbc’s website. and, thanks to crime movies, most uk viewers know enough of the geography of new york to realise that harlem is maybe not the most obvious place for a white-supremacist-style anti-semite to hide out. it will be revealing to see whether coverage becomes more informative – or not. december 29th, 2019 | 82 comments - (comments are closed) barking parking teslas niall kilmartin (stirling) · administrative · environment · health & medical long ago, milton friedman suggested the us might be better off without the food and drug administration. people wrote to him saying the fda should not be abolished but reformed so it would act differently. friedman replied by writing a column he titled ‘barking cats’: what would you think of someone who said, “i would like to have a cat provided that it barked?” … the way the fda now behaves, and the adverse consequences, are not an accident … but a consequence of its constitution.” today i chanced to hear a couple of medical professionals discuss the tesla they have just arranged to buy, bemoaning its cost but rejoicing there would be “no more gas-guzzling trips”. later they spoke of government policy on parking at nhs hospitals. labour brought in the policy – which cameron and may kept on, of course – to help save the environment by making parking at hospitals difficult (its proposers used different words) to encourage use of public transport. i learnt this policy much annoys shift-working nhs staff, who must sometimes travel in and out at hours when there is little or no public transport (or in areas that are not too salubrious). i already knew from my own friends and family that it much annoys elderly relatives visiting hospital patients – friends of mine have had to give up and go home again because an old man was not up to walking the distance from the nearest viable parking to visit an old woman, and might have had to be signed into the hospital himself if he’d tried. these tesla-buying nhs professionals conceded that the numerous (by government policy) almost-always-empty electric-car-only spaces that adorn the limited hospital parking provided were also annoying. the man remarked that a hospital he’d recently served at really wanted to convert an available site nearby into a car park – “but knew they’d never get permission.” the woman said that if the government wanted nhs staff and patients to use public transport, they should try and ensure large hospitals were well-served by buses, but her experience was the reverse – “they need some joined-up thinking!”. the thought flitted across my brain that greenie civil servants were not alone in needing to join up their thinking. and then i thought of friedman, long ago, recalling his “barking cats” column of yet longer ago: the error of supposing the behaviour of social organisms can be shaped at will is widespread. it is the fundamental error of most so-called reformers. … it explains why their reforms, when ostensibly achieved, so often go astray. (‘free to choose’) of course, i believe that the western world’s social organism could be shaped to respect science more and virtue-signalling agw non-science less. so maybe i shouldn’t be too critical. still, the bbc reported today that suvs are outselling electric cars 37:1, “making a mockery of uk policy” so there is hope – of a kind. december 9th, 2019 | 31 comments - (comments are closed) disparate-impact anti-semitism niall kilmartin (stirling) · activism · historical perspective between momentum activists complaining that labour is “not helped by the fact that the bbc has a lot of jewish journalists“ and corbyn saying the bbc “has a bias towards saying that… israel has a right to exist” there seems to be a feeling in labour circles that both jews and their concerns are over-represented in the media. this is not the first time round for such ideas. complaints that the germans were “a people with severed vocal chords”, that berlin’s major newspapers were owned and/or edited by jews, that “23 of 29 berlin theatre managers were jews” that “the barristers’ room in any berlin state court was like a jewish club” etc., were often made in the 1920s and 30s. nazi statistics, even in the days when the press (jewish-owned or otherwise) could still challenge them, were usually spun toward the high side – but aimed to persuade by describing areas where everyone knew jews far exceeded their less-than-one-percent of germany’s population. the nazis would not have achieved anything by claiming that too many german farmers were jews, or too many german generals. (it was the british empire, not germany, that produced sir john monash.) in many a pre-power speech that hitler gave, e.g. to students (students voted for him at twice the average german rate), he promised merely to remedy these disparate statistics and redress the historic injustices they revealed. that’s the trouble with disparate-impact theory. jews have often been victims of racism. but if the mere existence of racial disparities proves racism then a glance at many a country’s economic or cultural statistics will show, according to disparate-impact theory, how much more time jews must have spent perpetrating racism. percentages always sum to a hundred – so, even in countries where their fraction of the population is not much higher than in pre-war germany or even lower, any jewish higher-than-proportion achievement necessarily accompanies some lower-than-proportion percentages of other groups. disparate-impact theory exists precisely to crush the racist excuses offered for such racist disparities. and of course, this racism cannot remain confined within each country. since there are fewer jews in the world than there are citizens of kazakhstan, disparate-impact theory makes jews guilty of a lot of racism against kazakhs (and almost everyone else) in nobel prize awards. even the evil of toxic whiteness, conveying disproportionate prosperity and prestige to caucasians, cannot quite compare statistically with jewish disproportions, and if jewish survivors of violent dispossession repeatedly arrived near-destitute in new places, but their descendants averaged more of such places’ increased fame and wealth than the indigenes, well, by disparate-impact theory that just proves how committed jews must be to such racist behaviour. don’t they understand that at some point you’ve made enough money and won enough awards – and that point is strict statistical parity with the locals. and that, ladies and gentlemen, is one reason why a movement that calls you a nazi for arguing with it so often sounds like it is taking its lines from one of adolf’s early-30’s addresses. the political world, like the real world, is a sphere: go too far ‘fighting racism’ and you’ll meet your alleged opposites round the far side – and after that you’ll be so far gone you’re coming back. ________________________ [nazi propaganda remarks quoted above are referenced in contemporary book ‘the house that hitler built’ by stephen roberts.] december 2nd, 2019 | 69 comments - (comments are closed) a question about the racial experience at harvard niall kilmartin (stirling) · education & academia · north american affairs a recent post looked at the hypocrisy of harvard’s racist admissions policies. i want to look at what it teaches – not at what harvard says but at what the actual experience it gives to its students teaches them. 1) harvard invites students to attend a university – one of the halls of academia. by presenting itself as elite, it invites its students to think that academic ability, academic ways of thinking, are hallmarks (the hallmarks!) of an elite. 2) having implied the importance of academic talent in overt and subtle ways, harvard creates an artificial racial reality: it selects its asian-american students to average 140 scholastic aptitude test points more that its white-american students. it selects its white-american students to average 130 sat points more than its hispanic-american students. and it selects its african-american students to average 180 sat points less than its hispanics, 310 sat points less than its whites and 450 sat points less than its asians.* thus harvard gives members of each of these easily-distinguishable racial groups the routine experience of encountering a consistent, marked discrepancy between their group and other groups in precisely the area that the whole essence of being at harvard implies is important, not just for gaining some academic degree but for being worthy to decide on politics, social mores, life in general. day by day, the experience of being at harvard teaches its students that, in the quality that matters, asians are typically superior, whites are typically normal, hispanics are typically inferior and blacks even more so. harvard is a university – a pillar of academia, a place that implies academic is everything – and they chose the racial mix of their students to incarnate academic racial inequality. 3) harvard also teaches that it is the most appalling sin, unspeakably evil and harshly-punished even when the evidence is slight or non-existent, for any student ever to refer in the slightest, most micro, most indirect way to this routinely-experienced reality that harvard admissions has created. students must not in any way betray that they have noticed any aspect or even distant side-effect of the artificial reality harvard has created for them – and this of course compounds the artificiality of the harvard reality. so my question is: what does this experience in fact teach harvard students? in the early 1930s, workers in kiev and similar cities frequently had to step over starving people and corpses in the streets as they walked to catch their trams for the daily commute, on which they could read newspaper articles about the “new, happy life” that collectivising agriculture had brought, or look at posters proclaiming “life has become better, life has become more joyful – stalin”. (the nkvd swiftly removed the man who, by adding a letter, changed the russian to mean: “life has become better, life has become more joyful – for stalin.”) the few trustworthy reports of the time say the bizarre contrast between experienced reality and official propaganda (that one did not dare question) produced strange mental dislocations. harvard (thank god!) is a far lesser evil, but similar in this respect: students are immersed in an artificial reality – and then told it is a vile crime to betray the smallest symptom of having noticed it. does anyone know anecdotes, or studies, of what the psychological effects of this are? —- * that the differences are large is not open to honest dispute – which excludes many a pc commentator. back in the 1990s, when this situation was less developed, thomas sowell (in e.g. “race and culture”) reported that the black-white discrepancy was well into the three-figure range while asian-americans had to average 50+ points above whites to have the same admission chances. admissions discrimination against asian-americans, and for those minorities the pc like, appears to have grown since then. my figures above come from this article. the effect and its scale are clear; the precise sat point values are debatable and vary (rather growing than diminishing) over time. october 26th, 2019 | 15 comments - (comments are closed) older entries » who are we? the samizdata people are a bunch of sinister and heavily armed globalist illuminati who seek to infect the entire world with the values of personal liberty and several property. amongst our many crimes is a sense of humour and the intermittent use of british spelling. we are also a varied group made up of social individualists, classical liberals, whigs, libertarians, extropians, futurists, ‘porcupines’, karl popper fetishists, recovering neo-conservatives, crazed ayn rand worshipers, over-caffeinated virginia postrel devotees, witty frédéric bastiat wannabes, cypherpunks, minarchists, kritarchists and wild-eyed anarcho-capitalists from britain, north america, australia and europe. categories categories select category ~ glossary categories (114) a (2) b (28) c (7) d (3) e (4) f (5) g (2) h (1) i (3) j (1) k (4) l (6) m (12) n (1) o (1) p (9) r (5) s (6) t (7) v (1) w (5) x (1) ~ meme hacks categories (14) detournement (3) evil empire (5) hippopotami (1) propaganda (5) ~ photos #1 categories (8) ~ photos #2 categories (11) ~ photos #3 categories (2) ~ white rose categories (667) activism (17) administrative (9) big brother (43) biometrics (40) civil liberties (103) constitution (6) european union (45) events (5) historical perspective (27) identity cards (168) liberty (16) privacy (95) security (17) self-defence (5) self-ownership (8) slogans & quotations (21) surveillance (98) technology (50) abortion (14) activism (244) administrative (132) aerospace & astronautics (541) afghanistan (80) african affairs (187) anglosphere (134) antics & parties (152) architecture (86) arts & entertainment (919) asian affairs (268) aus/nz affairs (130) balkans (44) best of samizdata.net (82) blogging & bloggers (535) book reviews (145) children’s issues (121) chinese affairs (21) civil liberty & regulation (1,075) deleted by the pc media (48) eastern europe (128) economics, business & globalization (1,698) education & academia (336) environment (236) european affairs (383) european union (780) events (118) french affairs (263) german affairs (83) health & medical (378) hippos (19) historical views (721) how very odd!
