black mage level 75 “ravel keeper’s set” black mage level 80 artifact set and blm finished off the magic classes, so i got this lovely title. when going through the msq it gives gear coffers for you. i saved all of mine figuring that tanks are most gear dependent when leveling, so now that i’m working on the tank jobs it’s times to crack those coffers open. this is the “bluespirit” set usable at level 74. bluespirit again the zonureskin set at level 76 zonureskin again the dwarven mythril set at level 78. makes me look like a giant dwarf. oxymorons are the best! paladin level 80 artifact set paladin in the neo-ishgardian fending set after completing the last of the role quests, you get this title – and you may notice, i’m back with greysky armada. i missed the fc, so i joined back up! happy gaming out there! posted in final fantasy xiv, mmo leave a comment tags: ffxiv, final fantasy series [ffxiv] job progress feb 14 posted by pkudude99 a picture post — dragoon at 70 and ready to level in the augmented scaevan maiming set from poetics the glamour i used instead of the scaevan appearance while leveling. scaevan looked fine, but i liked this more. level 80 dragoon artifact set. i rather like this look, so i’ve glamoured in on top of my facet set. summoner level 80 artifact set summoner in facet gear scholar level 80 artifact set astrologian level 80 artifact set white mage level 80 artifact set. i quite like this one and would love to glam it on to my facet set, but that wouldn’t work if i chose to play the other 2 healers with the shared gear. 😦 of course i don’t really like healing anymore, so it’s unlikely i’d play any healer so it probably wouldn’t matter… white mage in the i450 facet set. i’ve dyed it white since i took this, but i don’t have a screenie of that somehow. i thought i’d taken one. ah well.. too lazy to log in to get one either 😛 but yeah, even though i said above that it’s unlikely i’ll play healer, i still like to be geared up so i have the option should the need arise. samurai level 80 artifact set samurai in the normal combat pose and without that odd-looking mask. now for monk so i can get rid of the “striking” gear that’s cluttering up my bags… overall combat job progress as of today. yes, i still need to finish the facet set of striking. won’t be long, as you can see why in the next picture — as you can see here…. i’m fully pentamelded on my crafting gear, for all 8 crafting jobs. i used the “comfy melds.” with the announced crafting changes for 5.2 next week this might not be ideal anymore, though. time will tell. my daughter’s “cat with red hair and red ears” modeling her new red and black dress from the valentione event. i’ve been running msq roulette on this character a decent amount to gear it with poetics for running through shb, with the side effect right now that i was able to buy the warring lanner and the 2 primal horse mounts for it… and it’s level 78, in spite of barely being in il mheg in the msq right now. msq roulette gives a *ton* of xp. i’m still not fully i400 from poetics yet. honestly, i’ll probably just toss a set of facet gear on her when she hits 80 and forget about the poetics at that point. my bunny’s current glamour. she’s now completed the doma portion of the msq in stormblood and has just returned to gyr abania, so it won’t be too long before she’s done with that and working the 4.1-4.5 content. in the meantime, she’s level 72 already and has poetics saved to be able to get the i400 gear when that vendor actually opens up for her, though at present she’s still mostly in the i270 level 60 gear from idyllshire in the heavensward expansion. she’s gotten a little gear from the leveling dungeons the msq takes one through, but i’m pretty much biding time until i can improve that, though at this rate she might be 80 before i finish stormblood and i’ll just toss facet gear on her too. who knows? and there you have it. happy gaming out there! posted in final fantasy xiv, mmo leave a comment tags: ffxiv, final fantasy series [ffxiv] omnicrafter complete jan 11 posted by pkudude99 so i had a 1500-word ramble in my drafts about leveling up the gathering classes and my progress on the crafting jobs, but well… it was a ramble. and it was from almost 2 weeks ago, so it was really out of date too so… it’s deleted and now this is in its place. right as i got my last one to 80. my gear’s better now… i’m a full-on omnicrafter again — all my crafting and gathering jobs are level 80. and i’ve even done enough collectible turn-ins that i almost have my “bis” crafting gear fully pentamelded — just have the rings left, and i may even see about finishing those up this weekend. thing is, though…. i really only have ever leveled the jobs up for the sake of “completionism” and not becuz i ever really planned to craft anything, so i’m not really sure why i suddenly put so much effort in to crafting on this go-round. maybe becuz the recent changes to the xp awards made leveling up crafting and gathering to be more or less trivial, so with the ease of leveling i just blasted through it to “get it out of the way” and then since i was already “in the mode” it was easy enough to just keep doing it? i don’t even know. level 80 bard artifact gear but anyway, so far as my ffxiv progress goes…. all the dex-based jobs are to 80 now, so that’s dancer, bard, machinist, and ninja. i find that given the skill changes from 5.0 that i prefer bard, as i generally play for relaxation and bard’s skills can almost all be put into a single-button macro. “dot 1, dot 2, spam the macro” is about as simple a playstyle as one can get. and while on the one hand, the lack of skill queue on macros is considered “bad” by serious players, but since bard actually relies on a bunch of procs and so you not only have to register that the proc hit but then select the skill, i find without the macro i’d often (maybe 1/3 of the time) miss procs entirely. then there are the longer cooldown skills that i always would “save for a burst phase” or something…. but i don’t raid, so there really aren’t any burst phases for me to ever worry about. add in that since i was used to not using the skills since i was always saving them, and then i’d always forget to use them anyway, so… yeah, i’m a bad player 😉 but anyway, putting all those skills into a macro means they’re actually being used, so… my macro might honestly be increasing my bard dps just becuz i’m bad at hitting procs and using the big-hit cooldowns. level 80 machinist artifact gear i’ve taken a page from aywren’s book and been getting all the other jobs to 71 so i can run trusts with them, if i desire. i’ve not done much with trusts yet, only unlocking up to the level 73 dungeon, but if i use trusts to level characters up, then i’m sure the rest will come rather easily over time. oddly enough, for the tanks, my formerly least favorite — the warrior — is now my “holy hannah this is awesome!” tank job. go figure, right? yet in groups, it seems warrior is the rarest to be seen. i mostly see dark knights, then gunbreakers, with paladins being a distant 3rd, and hardly ever seeing a warrior at all. level 80 ninja artifact gear anyway — in the interest of cleaning out gear from my bags i was planning on leveling dragoon next, followed with samurai and monk, but in the interest of being able to level my retainers, i may just to summoner and black mage instead. i think i’ve got a decent handle on summoner now with its 30-second phases for the bahamut summons and whatnot, but black mage is still somewhat throwing me for a loop. i like how enochian is now up while your astral or umbral buffs are up, not running on a separate timer anymore, and the a/u buffs are 15 seconds now instead of 12, so it’s much more forgiving on being able to keep the buffs up (especially since transpose is available on 10 second cooldown, so if you remember to hit it you can always keep the buff up anyway), but even so, it still just feels as clunky to me as it did back in 3.0. i still feel like i’m fighting the job to play it, not just fighting the monsters. red mage feels a it underwhelming, but is fun to play, at least, so between the 3 casters it shouldn’t take me long to get them up to 80 so the retainers can cap out and i can clean up space in my bags 😉 ye olde nutsy mount i finally caught up the stormblood beast tribes, so i’m allied with the 3 of them now. i also finished getting to bloodsworn ranks with the pixies just last night, and i even saved up enough nutsy seals to buy the lion sin-eater mount. which is so big it blocks half the screen and that’s annoying, so i took some screenies and will probably never use it again. and this is only 800-ish words, so it’s far less of a ramble than the previous draft… happy gaming out there! posted in final fantasy xiv, mmo leave a comment tags: ffxiv, final fantasy series star wars ep9 non-spoiler review dec 19 posted by pkudude99 saw episode 9 tonight for my company’s “winter holiday party.” my verdict: it’s decent. not great, but not a complete waste of time either. for comparison’s sake… tbh, i don’t really recall what i thought of tfa at the time — basically just remember thinking it mirrored ep4 and did all right, but there was a lot that didn’t make sense too. even so, overall i’d give that one a “thumbs up.” rogue one i enjoyed well enough, but i also haven’t ever felt the need to watch it a 2nd time either. i’d still say it’s the best of the films that have come out in recent years. tlj i just felt was pretty meh. i didn’t hate it like a lot of people seem to, but i certainly agree with their points as to why they hated it. for me it as just a big let-down. i was disappointed when the credits rolled. solo i left the theater feeling very entertained. i won’t say it’s a great movie, but i still felt upbeat when the credits rolled — had a smile on my face as i was leaving the theater. and now for ep9… several scenes that were supposed to be dramatic and full of tension had been spoiled by the trailers, so there actually wasn’t any tension in them. the “final battle” definitely had some thrilling moments, but then the denouement was just …. you know those rumors that focus groups shown the 6 different endings tended to laugh at the film? well… i laughed at it 3x, so that left me at the end going “eh, it was okay overall, but i’m never going to be seeing it again. better than tlj (but that’s a very low bar) and worse than tfa or solo.” otoh, my wife absolutely loved it, so….there’s division in the family now 😉 posted in general leave a comment [warframe] you have a railjack dec 3 posted by pkudude99 “you have a railjack” it says. the grind wasn’t even that bad. now for the wait until i can actually fly it…. a picture post — the empty hangar phase 1 begins with the “repair” of a fuselage segment as it’s being built, one can jump up on to it to explore the exterior the beauty shot of the finished product quest complete! 1st look at the interior it’s so nice to have a window out the top of the orbiter now and not feel like that low ceiling in the back parts is so claustrophobia-inducing another view out the top, this time in the void unlocked my 1st kuva lich. haven’t fought him yet, but he taunts me all the time now. in an odd quirk of rng, 3 rivens all wanted some form of “maintain a certain evel of combo multiplier vs level 30 mobs for 30 seconds.” one wanted a hobbled dragon key equipped, but the other 2 were “vanilla.” still and all, it enabled me to do 3 rivens in a single mission. posted in mmo leave a comment tags: warframe ← older posts contact us: email: nomadicgamerseh@gmail.com recent posts [ffxiv] still more job progress [ffxiv] job progress [ffxiv] omnicrafter complete star wars ep9 non-spoiler review [warframe] you have a railjack archives archives select month march 2020 (1) february 2020 (1) january 2020 (1) december 2019 (2) november 2019 (1) august 2019 (1) july 2019 (1) may 2019 (2) april 2019 (1) march 2019 (1) december 2018 (2) november 2018 (4) september 2018 (1) august 2018 (1) july 2018 (1) june 2018 (2) may 2018 (1) april 2018 (3) march 2018 (5) february 2018 (6) january 2018 (5) december 2017 (1) november 2017 (1) october 2017 (5) september 2017 (5) august 2017 (7) july 2017 (7) june 2017 (5) may 2017 (1) april 2017 (2) march 2017 (1) february 2017 (1) january 2017 (3) december 2016 (2) november 2016 (2) october 2016 (4) september 2016 (2) august 2016 (3) july 2016 (4) june 2016 (5) may 2016 (4) april 2016 (1) march 2016 (4) february 2016 (6) january 2016 (4) december 2015 (3) november 2015 (10) october 2015 (4) september 2015 (8) august 2015 (31) july 2015 (5) june 2015 (8) may 2015 (4) april 2015 (5) march 2015 (7) february 2015 (7) january 2015 (9) december 2014 (6) november 2014 (5) october 2014 (4) september 2014 (2) august 2014 (8) july 2014 (6) june 2014 (7) may 2014 (11) april 2014 (18) march 2014 (4) february 2014 (1) december 2013 (1) november 2013 (3) october 2013 (5) september 2013 (2) august 2013 (1) july 2013 (1) june 2013 (4) may 2013 (3) april 2013 (1) january 2013 (1) december 2012 (3) november 2012 (2) october 2012 (2) september 2012 (1) august 2012 (1) july 2012 (4) may 2012 (1) april 2012 (1) march 2012 (1) february 2012 (1) january 2012 (5) december 2011 (8) november 2011 (6) october 2011 (7) september 2011 (9) august 2011 (6) july 2011 (1) june 2011 (3) may 2011 (6) april 2011 (6) march 2011 (7) february 2011 (13) january 2011 (3) december 2010 (10) november 2010 (7) october 2010 (3) september 2010 (13) august 2010 (11) july 2010 (12) june 2010 (25) may 2010 (23) april 2010 (17) march 2010 (29) february 2010 (11) january 2010 (17) categories age of conan (1) aion (2) alganon (2) allods online (1) atari (1) browser based (2) champions online (6) civilization 5 (20) conquer online (1) d&d (1) darkfall (6) darkfall unholy wars (1) dungeons and dragons online (12) e3 (2) earthrise (2) eq (7) eq 2 (40) eve online (57) fallen earth (6) fallout 3 (1) final fantasy xiv (183) free realms (1) gameforge (1) general (84) gods & heroes (1) guild wars 2 (2) guildwars ii (1) heroes of might and magic online (1) legends of zork (2) login conference (1) mmo (300) mobile gaming (9) news (15) pax prime (1) pc (4) perpetuum (4) raptr (1) rift (38) rpg (8) silkroad online (1) sims 3 (1) star trek (1) star trek online (8) star wars: the old republic (21) stellar impact (1) the lord of the rings online (5) the sims medieval (1) tribes (1) vanguard (3) warhammer (2) warhammer 40k (1) warstory (1) wizard 101 (5) wizardry online (1) world of tanks (1) world of warcraft (11) meta register log in entries feed comments feed wordpress.com blog at wordpress.com. post to cancel
