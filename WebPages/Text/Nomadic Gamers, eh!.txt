i’ve been doing a lot of the restoration project. i reached 60+ in all crafts and harvests, and also picked up this really neat parasol! march 23, 2020 march 24, 2020 by stargrace in gaming 1 comment no longer a bunny – meow. march 22, 2020 march 24, 2020 by stargrace in gaming no comment so many cut scenes, so little time i’ve been playing final fantasy for a bit over two weeks now, and i have been having such an incredible time i wonder why i didn’t stick with the game previously. granted, experience is vastly changed to how it was when i used to play, but the game really does cater to everything i love in an mmo. two weeks in i’ve managed to finish the first main story quest (msq) and move past the filler quests that led to heavensword, which is where i’m at now. i loved my warrior, but i had high anxiety tanking dungeons which are a requirement for the msq (you can bypass this for a small fee) so i swapped over to red mage, which i enjoy but i don’t love. read more march 2, 2020 march 2, 2020 by stargrace in gaming 1 comment ffxiv ffxiv goals yesterday i hit level 48 on my marauder thanks to the daily roulette, and i’m working through the main story though i’m only in the 30’s for that. i know you can purchase a boost that will unlock all the story stuff from the mog station but i wanted to experience it myself, otherwise what’s the point in playing. i reached level 35 in mining and i’m learning how much i dislike harvesting 99 nodes for npc only slightly less than i enjoy harvesting 15 high quality nodes. it’s nice brainless work at least, so i can relax from the daily grind of smushing mobs. read more february 23, 2020 february 23, 2020 by stargrace in gaming 1 comment ffxiv health goals: details i mentioned i want to lose weight and get healthy in my previous post, so here’s a bit more of an in-depth look at what i’m doing to accomplish those goals. i’m going back to portion control by means of meal prep. this is what i did when i lost 75lbs last time, and i know it works for me. my issue is not eating unhealthy so much as it is eating way too much. with mean preparation i don’t need to figure out what i’m going to eat each day, it will already be cooked. i also don’t need to worry about how much of it i eat, because i have it all divided up in handy little containers. this also leaves me with more time during my days not focused on food, which is great because i have little time due to my kids anyway. less chance of making unhealthy choices. read more february 22, 2020 february 20, 2020 by stargrace in real life comments off on health goals: details fitnesshealth using that handspun i’ve been trying to make an effort this year to use up some handspun yarn, but honestly since i’m so new at spinning not all of it suits the projects i like to knit. i did make a scarf that i love, but there’s still lots of yarn to turn into something pretty. read more february 21, 2020 february 20, 2020 by stargrace in spinning, yarn comments off on using that handspun goals n stuff i’m not one for resolutions, and it’s already well on the way to march, but i do have some goals i want to work on this year, so i thought i’d post them here. one completed craft a month, for a total of 12. that means doubling up one month and then skipping a month is fine as long as by the end of the year i have at least 12 crafts total. track meals on myfitnesspal for at least 3 months in a row. reach below 200lbs reach gold cap in wow on at least one character reach 80 in at least one job in ffxiv it’s not a huge list, but i hope that makes it more reasonable to expect from myself. i might add to it as time goes on if it’s not enough of a challenge. it really depends on how much ‘free’ time i have this year (which is typically just about zero except for brief spurts when the kids are in bed, and even then i’m with my smallest every 30 minutes or so since she’s still restless and nursing these days. i constantly remind myself it’s just a phase, it’s just a phase). february 20, 2020 february 19, 2020 by stargrace in real life comments off on goals n stuff velvet blanket (5) it weighs about 20lbs but it’s glorious and i love it. february 19, 2020 february 19, 2020 by stargrace in crochet, yarn comments off on velvet blanket (5) previous posts follow us instagram twitch twitter youtube support us help support nomadic gamers, eh!
