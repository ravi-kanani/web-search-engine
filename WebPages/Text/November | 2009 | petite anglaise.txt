petite anglaise november 14, 2009 jack filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 10:13 pm jack was finally born at 41 weeks and 4 days on monday 2 november, on the night of the full moon. his birth was spookily similar to tadpole’s. i found myself in the same salle d’accouchement at the maternité des lilas where my daughter had been born six years earlier and, like his big sister, jack wasn’t all that keen on coming out. as a result, my hoped-for natural birth was soon forgotten as i had to be hooked up to various drips, given an epidural and strapped to a monitor. finally, at 7.03 pm, just as the midwife was paging the obstetrician and threatening me with forceps, i saw a head of dark hair emerging and the marathon was finally over (contractions had begun a full 24 hours earlier). i sobbed with relief afterwards and swore i would never go through it all again. eleven days later we are all well, blissfully happy and revelling in the boy’s paternity leave. jack would happily eat all day long, but he compensates by sleeping 4 or 5 hours in a row, twice a night. he pulls the most ridiculous faces when he’s trying to poo. the softest place in the whole world is the portion of his neck just below his little ears. i’m besotted with him, in short. we all are. tadpole wasn’t able to visit us at the hospital (h1n1 has a lot to answer for), but instantly fell in love with her little brother when i brought him home. ‘mummy,’ she said to me after her first cuddle with baby brother, ‘felicitations for making such a perfect baby.’ comments (144) search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com. post to cancel
