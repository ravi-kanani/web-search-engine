table of contents reviewers: what’s in october 2017’s degustabox? motherhood diaries unboxing this month’s degustabox below: products feel good drinks – water infusions losalt® vimto millions gift jar michel et augustin pechkeks misfortune cookies kabuto thai green chicken curry noodles cirio ready to eat (a brand under valfrutta) nuttvia breadsticks snackpack heinz no added sugar hoops hippeas organic chickpea puffs lee kum kee sauces pip’s real hot chocolate coins pulsin kids’ fruit oat bars – orange choc chip what did i like most about october 2017’s degustabox? rating: reviewers: tommy (daddy) leyla (mummy) aron (7 years old) aidan (5 years old) what’s in october 2017’s degustabox? motherhood diaries unboxing this month’s degustabox below: products feel good drinks – water infusions “we believe that if you drink good, you feel good. feel good drinks use 100% natural ingredients only – made from a simple blend of water, fruit and natural flavourings with a refreshing taste. there are three uplifting and contemporary flavours in each of our drink ranges. *two flavours were included in each degustabox. facebook – feel good drinks twitter – feel good drinks instagram – feel good drinks website – feel good drinks“ our opinion – the orange, mango and water juice drink tasted very authentic and i found it to be the most refreshing after a workout. the strawberry & mint version had a more subtle flavour, which i preferred, but i still favour water as the go-to drink for quenching thirst. this drink did a pretty good job of refreshing me after a workout, though! 4/5 losalt® “too much salt (sodium chloride) in the diet can increase the risk of high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. with 66% less sodium than regular table, sea and rock salts, switching to losalt will help you to maintain normal blood pressure. the perfect blend of two natural mineral salts – potassium chloride and sodium chloride – losalt is the healthier alternative for seasoning, cooking and baking without compromising on flavour. and it’s easy to use – if your recipe calls for 1tsp salt, switch for 1tsp losalt – it does the same and tastes the same! losalt – the natural choice for your table and kitchen cupboard. facebook – losalt twitter – losalt www.losalt.com“ our opinion – i barely cook with salt in our house and since turning vegan i have felt less need for salt in my meals, perhaps, because my taste buds have changed a bit. but, my husband is a salt fiend, so i’ve found that having losalt nearby for him to douse over his food causes me less worry than when he was throwing table salt over his meat. the flavour still tastes exactly the same, but losalt contains 66% less sodium, so opting for the healthier version is always a bonus 4/5 vimto millions gift jar “millions gets seriously mixed up with vimto. vimto millions are available in a variety of formats, 40g count line, taper jars and a £1 pmp. millions aren’t just unique in shape and size, they’re known for their fabulously strong, punchy flavours. that’s why vimto’s distinctive taste is the perfect fit. http://www.facebook.com/millionssweets http://millionssweets.co.uk“ our opinion – i really wanted to rate these vimto millions a 1 out of 5 because these bloomin’ delicious and reminiscent vimto flavour sweets were too difficult to put down and so i finished the whole jar in less than two days – by myself! i just couldn’t put the jar down! i couldn’t share them because i didn’t want to give empty calorie sweets to my kids, but my sugar levels… they must have soared after i’d finished these. damn you delicious vimto sweets that made me really want to have can of vimto because it reminded me of the good ol’ days. “put a vimto smile on your face!” (remember those adverts?) 5/5 michel et augustin “oversized cookies with a melty middle and big chocolate chips, made with real fresh butter, free-range eggs and love. take a few our super cookies with melty middle milk chocolate and real hazelnuts. enjoy an incredible taste. warning: taste buds will be tickled 😉 facebook – micheletaugustin twitter – micheletaugustin instagram – micheletaugustin www.micheletaugustin.com“ our opinion – these were very gooey, very decadent and indulgent cookies, and you could taste the butter and eggs, they were that rich. these snacks should be reserved as special treats because i can’t imagine they’re too healthy to have all the time. having said that, they did taste very, very nice! 4.5/5 pechkeks misfortune cookies “these cookies are like a left hook. you can’t explain how much they hurt. but they’re also perfect for people who like to laugh. who doesn’t take life too seriously, or don’t mind a dose of reality now and then. they are for friends who you really like. or acquaintances who you can’t stand. and for any party that needs some added fun or any meal that could do with a bit more spice. black cookies, black humour: ideal for lucky lukes and bad-luck brians, superwomen and high-flyers, crybabies and wussy wimps, iron ladies and tough guys. the cookies are available online on our webshop, on amazon and lots of different shops all over europe. there is a shop finder on our website, but if you need any help buying our mercilessly funny and brutally honest products just contact us via e-mail and we’ll help you! *one misfortune cookie was included in each degustabox. facebook – pechkeks twitter – pechkeks instagram – pechkeks www.misfortune-cookies.co.uk“ our opinion – i’ve had these misfortune cookies before and their messages are not lovey-dovey or motivating, which is the point of these misfortune cookies. i do like the darker spin on the infamous fortune cookies and found them to be quite amusing. i think the boys were more interested in the gothic-style eerie packing, but, otherwise, they taste exactly the same as normal fortune cookies. not sure that i’d i’d relay their hidden misfortune to them though – they’re not old enough to understand the parody yet! 4.5/5 kabuto thai green chicken curry noodles “our new gluten-free rice noodle dish is inspired by the fragrant green curries from thailand. they are a delicious combination of asian inspired flavours and real quality natural ingredients with no additives or preservatives. ready in minutes they are quick to make and long to savour! http://www.facebook.com/kabutonoodles/ https://twitter.com/kabutonoodles http://www.instagram.com/kabuto_noodles http://kabutonoodles.com“ our opinion – i’ve also had these kabuto rice noodles before. however, last time i tried the normal noodles. this time, i tried the gluten-free rice noodle version and thought the same thing as last time – i wasn’t in love with them. the convenience is great – you just have to add water – but, i thought that there just weren’t enough noodles and too much of the spice, which overpowered the entire flavour. i would fill the pot with half the water it recommends and, perhaps, the flavour wouldn’t be so overpowering, i guess? they’re not super bad, i do think my husband would have preferred these more. but, just not for me. 2.5/5 cirio ready to eat (a brand under valfrutta) “be the first in the uk to try one of a new range of tasty ready to eat mediterranean dishes, soon to be available in new packaging; cous cous with mixed vegetables, bulgur, quinoa, red rice, tomatoes and green olives, basmati rice & lentils and spelt with black olives, dried tomatoes and capers. delicious cold in salads or heat for a tasty meal. tear open and microwave for 1 minute or pan heat for 2-3 minutes.” *one of four varieties is included in each degustabox. www.cirio1856.co.uk“ our opinion – cirio is a great brand. i love their borlotto beans, which ended up being my favourite items in september 2016’s degustabox, and their passata and tomato puree, which really enhanced the flavour of my pasta. so i knew i was going to love these ready-to-eat mediterranean basmati rice & lentils. and, i did. they were so tasty! in fact, you don’t need to add anything else to these, not even sauce. just stick them in the microwave for 1 minute and you’ve got yourself a healthy snack. i’d love to stock up on these delicious vegan options now that i’m a fully fledged vegan. at least i wouldn’t have to continuously work out what i’m going to eat every day! 5/5 nuttvia breadsticks snackpack “nuttvia is a tasty hazelnut spread made with zero palm oil and 97% less sugar. it also has a 5-star health rating and has been certified with the orangutan alliance no palm oil seal. the full range includes the nuttvia 600g jar perfect for the whole family; the 350g jar for all the hazelnut spread lover out there and nuttvia on the go breadsticks snack pack. small in size but big in flavour, the nuttvia breadsticks snack pack is the ideal sweet treat on the go. indulge in the deliciousness of hazelnut spread with zero palm oil 97% less sugar. perfect in the school lunchbox or as a snack, the nuttvia breadsticks taste delicious and can go anywhere you go. nuttviaspread nuttviaspread nuttviaspread www.nuttvia.com“ our opinion – a snack that tastes like nutella and has 97% less sugar!? need i say more? 5/5 heinz no added sugar hoops “no added sugar hoops give consumers another great option for mealtimes. with no artificial sweeteners, colours, or flavours and 1 of your five a day they are a nutritious and convenient solution for families. no added sugar – great heinz taste! https://en-gb.facebook.com/heinzuk/ http://www.heinz.co.uk“ our opinion – we’ve enjoyed heinz’s products in a previous degustabox, where the kids got to enjoy heinz kid’s dry pasta shapes and kid’s pasta sauce, which they loved. this time the well-known uk heinz spaghetti hoops now contains no added sugar and is one of your five a day. of course, the kids loved the sweetened tomato sauce, which is great when you want to provide them with a quick snack or a small meal just before they start their after school activities – just pop in the microwave and add to some wholemeal toast. 4/5 hippeas organic chickpea puffs “hippeas is the all new range of organic chickpea puffs which is set to shake-up the global snacking market with a bold brand story and purpose, clear health credentials and exciting flavour profiles. light, crunchy and airy, but packing a serious punch of protein and fibre, hippeas is the vegan-friendly, on-the-go snack that plans to spread #peasandlove across the world. available from tesco, waitrose, boots, holland & barrett, asda, planet organic, whole foods, wh smith and online at ocado and www.hippeas.com *one of three flavours was included in each degustabox. http://www.facebook.com/hippeassnacks/ https://twitter.com/hippeas_snacks https://www.instagram.com/hippeas_snacks/ http://www.hippeas.com“ our opinion – we’ve tried these hippeas organic chickpea puffs in a degustabox review just five months before, so i wasn’t sure why we were getting them again in this month’s degustabox. somehow, i found them better this month, perhaps because my taste buds have changed since going vegan at the beginning of january, but i found them better than average this time. they actually make nice snacks for when you’re on-the-go and they’re chickpea-based, so they’re healthier than crisps. for those reasons, they get an extra star this month. 4/5 lee kum kee sauces “lee kum kee sauce sachets offer a wide range of classic chinese flavours and save you time in the kitchen. we have two from the range for you to try, other flavours include; sauce for kung pao chicken and sauce for broccoli beef in oyster sauce. sauce for tomato garlic prawns – prepared from tomato, chilli peppers, honey and garlic. best for stir-frying with prawns, but also great for cooking with meat and vegetables. it can also be used in a sauce mix for salads and as a dressing. sauce for honey garlic spare rib – made with honey and garlic. best used with meat in stir-fries or marinades, but also as a sauce mix and dressing. facebook – leekumkee twitter – leekumkee instagram – leekumkee www.uk.lkk.com“ our opinion – i couldn’t bring myself to try these because of all the weird e numbers and chemicals in the back. i prefer to make my sauce from scratch and i just found these to not be ‘natural’ enough to give them a try. sorry, i’ve passed them onto a friend who will have better luck with them. update – i did try the sauce for honey garlic spare ribs, but in a lentil shepherd’s pie and not on spare ribs. to be honest, it tasted like glorified hoisin sauce, which was tasty, but still, it felt very chemical. i wouldn’t buy these because i’d prefer to make the sauce from scratch. 2.5/5 pip’s real hot chocolate coins “real belgian chocolate hand moulded by pip into single servings of hot chocolate then hand-wrapped – flavoured only with natural ingredients. being nut-free, gluten-free, and dairy-free these taste better, feel better in the mouth, and are suitable for almost every diet. there are even ones with no added sugar! *this product was included in the degustabox for our longer-term subscribers only. http://facebook.com/realhcc https://twitter.com/realhcc http://instagram.com/realhcc http://www.pipsformilk.co.uk“ our opinion – i’m going to give the pip real hot chocolate coin five stars for three reasons. (1) the chocolate orange flavour is bloody delicious! (2) they’re dairy-free which means i can still have them when i’m vegan and (3) you can break them in half and still enjoy a lovely hot chocolate so two for the price of one, albeit slightly diluted. if you try them with original almond milk, this belgian hot chocolate orange drink is just yum and totally vegan! well deserved five stars. 5/5 pulsin kids’ fruit oat bars – orange choc chip “deliciously wholesome orange choc chip oat bars are packed with gluten-free uk oats, real fruit and natural ingredients, making them the ideal snack for kids on the go. pulsin uses tooth-friendly xylitol to sweeten the chocolate, which occurs naturally in many fruits and vegetables and blend it with premium orange oil, gluten-free oats and real fruit to create a mix of flavours that kids love. the kids’ fruity oat bars are designed to count as 1 of a child’s 5 a day and the fun new packaging is an ideal way to brighten up lunch boxes. plus, with 1/3 less sugar than the average kids’ fruit snack* and high in fibre, this range makes the perfect healthy alternative to other lunch box snacks. *based on a survey sample of kids’ fruit snacks in 2017. facebook – pulsinandbeond twitter – pulsinandbeond instagram – pulsinandbeond www.pulsin.co.uk“ our opinion – i only managed to sneak in a teeny tiny taste before the boys devoured this orange choc chip oat bar and, considering they have a third less sugar, they’re gluten-free (although my boys don’t suffer from a gluten allergy) and they make up 1 of a child’s 5-a-day, i didn’t feel so bad providing this fruit oat bar as a snack. again, i prefer to make these kinds of snacks, but sometimes it’s nice to just pick up a bar and eat it without any of the prep, cook and mess afterwards. 4/5 what did i like most about october 2017’s degustabox? i don’t really want to admit it, but because of the rate i ate those vimtos millions, i’m going to have to mark those as my favourite. they brought back so many memories! rating: 4 out of 5 – overall a nice selection of items this time, with the addition of some rather unhealthy, but very moreish sweets (thanks, vimto!) i’d like to see more vegan-friendly products because of the growing trend of veganism and vegan food out there, but that’s just a preference. i’d also like to see less sugar please and more items that you can cook with, like some great sauces that don’t contain e numbers?
