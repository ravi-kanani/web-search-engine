it protects the integrity and confidentiality of data sent between websites and visitors' browsers. last september, we began rolling out https support for blogspot domain blogs so you could try it out. today, we‚Äôre launching another milestone: an https version for every blogspot domain blog. with this change, visitors can access any blogspot domain blog over an encrypted channel. the https indicator in the chrome browser as part of this launch, we're removing the https availability setting. even if you did not previously turn on this setting, your blogs will have an https version enabled. we‚Äôre also adding a new setting called https redirect that allows you to opt-in to redirect http requests to https. while all blogspot blogs will have an https version enabled, if you turn on this new setting, all visitors will be redirected to the https version of your blog at https://<your-blog>.blogspot.com even if they go to http://<your-blog>.blogspot.com. if you choose to turn off this setting, visitors will have two options for viewing your blog: the unencrypted version at http://<your-blog>.blogspot.com or the encrypted version at https://<your-blog>.blogspot.com. the new https redirect setting in the blogger dashboard please be aware that mixed content may cause some of your blog's functionality not to work in the https version. mixed content is often caused by incompatible templates, gadgets, or post content. while we're proactively fixing most of these errors, some of them can only be fixed by you, the blog authors. to help spot and fix these errors, we recently released a mixed content warning tool that alerts you to possible mixed content issues in your posts, and gives you the option to fix them automatically before saving. existing links and bookmarks to your blogs are not affected by this launch, and will continue to work. please note that blogs on custom domains will not yet have https support. this update expands google's https everywhere mission to all blogspot domain blogs. we appreciate your feedback and will use it to make future improvements. posted by milinda perera, software engineer, security an update to the blogger post editor to help with mixed content april 19, 2016 back in september, we announced that https support was coming to blogspot.com, making it possible for you to encrypt connections to your blog; since then, many of you have enabled https for your blogs. in some cases, not all of your blog‚Äôs functionality has worked over https due to mixed content errors often stemming from your template, gadgets, or blog post content. to help spot and fix some of these errors, we're releasing a mixed content warning tool that alerts you to possible mixed content issues in your posts, and gives you the option to fix them automatically before saving. to use the tool, turn on https for your blog, open the blogger editor html view, and click save or publish. if the editor detects any errors they will be shown above the editor, along with the option to fix the errors found. happy blogging! posted by shweta karwa, software engineer, security. best practices for reviewing products you've received for free march 11, 2016 editor's note: this post was cross posted from the google webmaster central blog. as a form of online marketing, some companies today will send bloggers free products to review or give away in return for a mention in a blogpost. whether you‚Äôre the company supplying the product or the blogger writing the post, below are a few best practices to ensure that this content is both useful to users and compliant with google webmaster guidelines. use the nofollow tag where appropriate links that pass pagerank in exchange for goods or services are against google guidelines on link schemes. companies sometimes urge bloggers to link back to: the company‚Äôs site the company‚Äôs social media accounts an online merchant‚Äôs page that sells the product a review service‚Äôs page featuring reviews of the product the company‚Äôs mobile app on an app store bloggers should use the nofollow tag on all such links because these links didn‚Äôt come about organically (i.e., the links wouldn‚Äôt exist if the company hadn‚Äôt offered to provide a free good or service in exchange for a link). companies, or the marketing firms they‚Äôre working with, can do their part by reminding bloggers to use nofollow on these links. disclose the relationship users want to know when they‚Äôre viewing sponsored content. also, there are laws in some countries that make disclosure of sponsorship mandatory. a disclosure can appear anywhere in the post; however, the most useful placement is at the top in case users don‚Äôt read the entire post. create compelling, unique content the most successful blogs offer their visitors a compelling reason to come back. if you're a blogger you might try to become the go-to source of information in your topic area, cover a useful niche that few others are looking at, or provide exclusive content that only you can create due to your unique expertise or resources. for more information, please drop by our google webmaster central help forum. posted by the google webspam team an update on google friend connect december 21, 2015 in 2011, we announced the retirement of google friend connect for all non-blogger sites. we made an exception for blogger to give readers an easy way to follow blogs using a variety of accounts. yet over time, we‚Äôve seen that most people sign into friend connect with a google account. so, in an effort to streamline, in the next few weeks we‚Äôll be making some changes that will eventually require readers to have a google account to sign into friend connect and follow blogs. as part of this plan, starting the week of january 11, we‚Äôll remove the ability for people with twitter, yahoo, orkut or other openid providers to sign in to google friend connect and follow blogs. at the same time, we‚Äôll remove non-google account profiles so you may see a decrease in your blog follower count. we encourage you to tell affected readers (perhaps via a blog post), that if they use a non-google account to follow your blog, they need to sign up for a google account, and re-follow your blog. with a google account, they‚Äôll get blogs added to their reading list, making it easier for them to see the latest posts and activity of the blogs they follow. we know how important followers are to all bloggers, but we believe this change will improve the experience for both you and your readers. posted by michael goddard, software engineer Ó¢ä ÓóÑ Óóà labels ÓóÖ +1 3 10th birthday 13 2010 1 accessibility 1 ads 1 adsense 7 amazon 1 android 2 blog2print 1 blogger 26 blogger birthday 1 blogger fiesta 2 blogger meetup 2 blogger stats 2 blogger template designer 1 blogger2print 1 blogspot 2 blogthis 1 blogworld 2 buzz 1 calendar 1 chrome 2 code 1 commenting 2 community 8 conference 2 custom domain 1 developers 2 dmca 1 draft 1 dynamic views 5 events 2 feedburner 2 feeds 1 firefox 1 follow by email 1 following 2 foxytunes 1 ftp 1 gadgets 10 gan 3 google analytics 1 google buzz 1 google sites 1 google+ 10 grandcentral 1 help 2 ios 1 jump 1 knol 1 lightbox 1 mobile 5 monetize 3 music 1 navbar 2 new ui 4 next blog 1 onetruefan 1 openid 1 opensky 1 page creator 1 pages 1 pixelodeon 1 polls 1 post summaries 1 read more 1 recommend 1 seo 2 share 3 support 1 sxsw 1 template designer 2 twitter 1 video 2 videoblogging 1 viglink 1 web fonts 1 webcall 1 youtube 3 zemanta 1 Óãá archive ÓóÖ ÓóÖ Óóá 2019 jan ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2018 may ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2017 mar ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2016 nov may apr mar ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2015 dec sep jun may jan ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2014 feb ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2013 dec sep aug jun apr ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2012 dec nov oct sep aug jul jun may apr mar feb jan ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2011 dec nov oct sep aug jul jun may apr mar feb jan ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2010 dec nov oct sep aug jul jun may apr mar feb jan ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2009 dec nov oct sep aug jul jun may apr mar feb jan ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2008 dec nov oct sep aug jul jun may apr mar feb jan ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2007 dec nov oct sep aug jul jun may apr mar feb jan ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2006 dec nov oct sep aug jul jun may apr mar feb jan ÓóÖ ÓóÖ 2005 dec nov oct sep aug jul jun may apr mar feed follow @blogger google privacy terms
