authority seo 2.0 blog about tools contact on-page seo tutorial: how to perfectly optimize your website by chris lee 91 comments last updated on: september 6, 2019 in this tutorial, i’ll show you the exact on-page seo techniques you can use to outrank your competitors. although google is getting smarter, you still need to optimize your pages if you want to show up as the most relevant result. i have a few competitors in my niches who are not optimizing their site at all. they have a much stronger link profile than me, and have amassed links for years before my site was even created. but my site is optimized much better, and i outrank them. want to learn how? let’s dive in. on-page seo vs off-page seo on-page seo refers to the optimization of your html source code and content to rank higher in search engines for your targeted keywords. off-page seo refers to increasing positive external signals pointing to your site such as backlinks. back in the day when i used to work with seo clients, clients who had on-page seo issues were my favorite to work with. why? because they were the easiest to fix! on-page seo is totally under our control. we can fix issues instantly. off-page seo, on the other hand, takes longer. you need to go out and “build” links on other websites that you don’t own, and the process is more complex and time consuming. there are a lot of websites out there with huge backlink profiles that don’t get a lot of search traffic. the reason? their on-site seo sucks. just a few tweaks to your content and html source code can drastically increase their rankings and traffic. let’s go through what a perfectly optimized seo article looks like. it all starts with search intent before we start optimizing anything, we have to make sure that we’re not fighting a losing battle. google is getting better and better at understanding search intent – what users are specifically looking to do when they make a search query. if google sees that searchers for a keyword are looking for ecommerce content, your informational content is not going to rank no matter what you try. and even if you do, it won’t last long. your horrendous bounce rate will tell google your page is not relevant for that keyword anyways. it only makes sense that this is the very first place you start when optimizing any page for a keyword. always try and maximize your understanding of what the search intent behind that keyword is before you create something around it. is the searcher looking to buy something or are they looking for information? are they looking for quick or in-depth information? what pages are ranking already? why are they ranking? what type of content would help the searcher answer their question fully and in the best way? once you understand that, we can begin the optimization process. have your keyword in your title tag and make it compelling a page has many html tags, but the title tag is the most important one. your title tag is the most important on-page seo factor. it’s what tells google what your page is about, and it’s also what shows up in the google search result. it’s still surprising to me when i browse the web, and see a website with a super strong link profile. they should be ranking #1, no competitor should even come close to outranking them. but the title of their page is something like: “main” and they’re nowhere to be found. keyword in title tag: if you want to rank for a keyword, the first and most important step is to have the keyword in the title tag. title tag character limit: make your title tag too long, and it will be cut off by google with ellipses. today, there isn’t a total character limit. it’s totally user and device dependant. ideally though, your title tag should be 60 to 70 characters in length. creating your title: just because having the keyword in your title is important, doesn’t mean you should create title tags with just your keyword. you want to make it interesting so that people want to click through to your page rather than the others. here’s what you shouldn’t do: instead, go for something like this: the second one is much more interesting and detailed, and also accomplishes another very important thing… optimizing for related keywords: if you have room for more characters in your title, target another keyword that’s closely related. in the example above, i fit in “create articles that rank” alongside my main keyword. if i can get this page to rank for “on-page seo” then i have a high chance of ranking for the other one as well. this is something i do a lot, and it makes a big difference in how many keywords your article ranks for, and drives more long-tail traffic to your page. don’t go overboard though. it has to be very closely related to your main keyword. entice a click with your meta description what’s a meta description? it’s the snippet of text in each google search result that describes what the page is about. the meta description isn’t a direct ranking factor, so it’s not a huge issue if you don’t optimize it. however, it can help increase your ctr in the search engine results. the best method of writing a meta description is to try and convince the searcher why they should click on your page rather than the others. think of it like you’re writing an ad description. the more enticing it is to the reader, the higher your ctr is likely to be. note: even if you write the perfect meta description, google often shows other content from your page within the description depending on what the user is searching for. keep url’s short and simple shorter is better. try to keep your url’s short and concise, and try not to bury content deep in multiple directories. just keep in your main keywords, and cut out everything else. you can edit your url’s in wordpress here: as you can see, my title is really long, but my url has been edited to be short, and contain only the main keywords. *this isn’t a major issue. having reasonably long url’s are not going to hurt your google rankings. however, it’s just good practice to get into the habit of creating clean, keyword-focused url’s. you can read more about good url structures for seo here. use header tags to tell search engines what your subtopics are headers are simple. whatever you put into your title tag should be wrapped in an h1 tag on the page. if you’re using wordpress, your title will automatically be used as your h1 tag in most cases. but you could still change it up a little bit using an seo plugin like yoast. the rest of your headers should be h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. personally, i usually never use anything beyond h2. i only use h3’s when i need to expand further on a topic within the h2 subtopic. like this: as you can see above, the h3 subtopic is still within the h2 subtopic of goals. header tags are also a great way to improve your user experience on the page. headers give your page depth and organization. they guide the user through the article. few things to note: 1. there should only be one h1 tag on a page. 2. don’t skip header tags. don’t use h1 and then h4’s throughout the page. go in order of importance/significance. 3. it’s not essential to use multiple header tags in a page, but don’t forget the h1. and lastly… no keyword stuffing for h2 and h3 tags – keep it simple use wikipedia, one of the best examples of a website that does on-site seo correctly, as an example. they don’t use the the main keyword in their h2 and h3 header tags. it’s not: “seo history” or “seo as a marketing strategy” or “white hat seo vs black hat seo techniques”. i see a lot of people excessively stuffing keywords into all their header tags. there was a time when this worked, and it was recommended to do so. today, especially after hummingbird, there’s really no need to do this kind of stuff. if you have too high a keyword density, it can hurt your rankings. sometimes, you can’t help but use the keyword all throughout the page. if you’re writing naturally, that’s fine. but if you’re excessively stuffing keywords into all your header tags just because you hope that it gives you a rankings boost, you’re potentially putting your rankings at risk. should you focus on keyword density at all? no… but not entirely. what i like to do is to write naturally first and don’t focus on keyword density at all. when i’m outsourcing content, i’ll tell the writer to ignore keyword density. after the article is completed, i’ll either replace synonyms with keywords and lsi keywords if the density is too low, or i’ll remove them and add synonyms if it’s too high. if you’re unfamiliar with lsi keywords, ankit does a great job of explaining them in this article. don’t forget image alt tags using images makes the article have a better user experience. it’s much more enjoyable to read content that has images than it is to read hundreds of lines of pure text. but a lot of people forget to optimize their images with proper alt tags. setting alt tags to images gives google another indication of what your page is about. how to use the alt tags: for the first/feature image of a blog post, i’ll put in my keyword as my alt tag. all other alt tags should be used for describing the image. don’t stuff them with keywords. use lsi keywords: using images to add lsi keywords is one of my favorite on-site seo strategies. don’t stuff your main keyword into every alt tag. instead, use it as an opportunity to add even more lsi keywords into your page. for example, for the image i used earlier: i set the alt tag as “wikipedia use of header tags”: it clearly describes the image while using an lsi keyword that isn’t my main keyword. use your main keyword early on in your article go through any of wikipedia’s articles, and you’ll notice that they always have their main keyword as the first word, and that it’s bolded. you don’t need to go that far, but you shouldn’t be 1000 words deep into your content before you bring up your main keyword for the first time. for best results, use it as early on as you can. for me, i always try to use the keyword in my first sentence. make your content long and thorough, but understand search intent longer content ranks better. based on studies by moz and buzzsumo, longer articles tend to get more links and shares. and this study by serpiq analyzed the top 10 search results for over 20,000 keywords and noticed that on average, content ranking on the first page of google had over 2000 words. while optimum content length varies depending on keyword difficulty, and type of keyword, it’s fair to conclude that long form content is the way to go if you’re serious about ranking for anything (especially informational keywords). for standard blog posts, i try to keep my articles between 1800 to 2500 words in length. the type (and length) of content you create depends on search intent. it largely depends on the scope of the topic, and keyword. for some topics, it just doesn’t make sense to have so many words. deep linking what’s one of the biggest signs of unnatural linking? having all your links pointed at just your homepage. one of the keys to building a successful blog these days is to make sure that your links are spread out throughout your domain. it’s just natural. don’t just build links to your homepage. build links to your internal pages as well. it’s a tough concept for people new to seo to understand why building links to page x helps increase rankings for page y. it’s one of the reasons why broken link building is so effective, and one of the reasons people like neil patel invests thousands of dollars creating infographics. his infographics attract a lot of links and shares. but these links usually point only at the page the infographic is on, not other pages he’s trying to rank. so how does that help rankings for other pages? your domain authority increases and you build more trust to your site overall. this in turn increases rankings across the board for your entire domain. of course, make sure to set up your internal links on those pages so that they pass this link juice to the pages you want to rank higher. link flow through internal links you should be interlinking your blog posts whenever possible. proper internal linking is probably one of the easiest (and fastest) ways to improve your site’s seo. why? internal links helps improve your link flow to individual pages on your site, helping them to rank better. the anchor text of links helps google to understand the context of a webpage and to rank better. internal links help google bots crawl and access different parts of your site. internal links also improve user experience by providing them with more information on certain topics. that in turn increases your user metrics such as bounce rate and time on site which are all ranking factors. when you publish new articles, link to your older articles wherever you can. and you should also make it a habit to go back to older articles and link to your newer articles. use a lot of sources / external links when i’m onboarding new writers, one of my criteria is to use and link to as many sources as they can. linking out to helpful external sites is just a better user experience overall. so you should do it more often. you won’t lose your rankings by linking out to a helpful resource. if anything, it will make your own content more credible and trustworthy. for instance, i love reading content like this articles by forbes because there are links everywhere. when i read a sentence that intrigues me, and i want to learn more, there’s usually a link to another page which extensively covered that story. now, that’s a helpful external link! know what i’m thinking after reading it? forbes really did their research and covered this story thoroughly. i trust this site. when you write an article, you’re not the only authority on every single sub-topic within the article. there are other places where people can go to learn more. link to them. don’t be a dead end on the internet. link out to helpful sites. credit sources where you got your information. outbound links in relation to your rankings is pretty well explained in this video by moz. should you nofollow external links? ever know somebody who’s super cheap? don’t be that guy. nofollowing every external link in fear of sharing link juice is pretty much like being the cheap friend who is stingy about spending a dollar more than their fair share. share the link love! you won’t lose rankings for linking out to helpful sources on the internet. in-page links for easy navigation one of my favorite things about a wikipedia article is how they organize their content with in-page links. i’m talking about this thing at the top of every article. it’s a great user experience because it allows you to preview all the major sub-topics within the content, and then jump straight to the section you’re interested in. it’s the perfect way to format organize really long pieces of content. for example, i created in-page links for my outreach link building guide because it’s over 10,000 words long. creating in-page links is really easy to do. all you need to do is create links and id’s throughout the page by following this guide. note: creating in-page links is probably not the best thing to do on pages with less than 1500 words. it’s short enough that people can just easily scroll through everything. but if you have pages that are over 2000 words long, it’s a nice feature to add on. natural writing don’t write for search engines. write for people, then optimize for search engines afterwards by going through the techniques we just learned. don’t pay too much attention to keyword density. sometimes, your keyword density will be higher than others. that’s just due to the nature of the keyword. there isn’t a “perfect” keyword density you should be shooting for. instead, check to see how it reads after right before you publish it. if it sounds weird because you’re stuffing keywords everywhere, then use pronouns or lsi keywords to remove some of your keywords. if you notice your keyword isn’t mentioned enough, then sprinkle it in a bit more. as long as it reads naturally, you’ll be fine. focusing on keyword density will hurt most people more than it helps them. page speed and lastly, page speed. if your page takes forever to load, you’re going to have a really high bounce rate. even a one second delay in page load time can decrease your page views and conversions by a significant amount. on a mobile device, google recently reported that on a mobile site, as page load time goes from one second to five seconds, the probability of bounce increases by 90%. the fastest way to increase your page load time is to switch to a high end hosting company. if you don’t want to increase your hosting budget by hundreds of dollars per year, you can also use cloudflare (free) combined with a caching plugin. here were my results when i implemented cloudflare with a caching plugin: before: after: only took 10 minutes of work, and it was compeltely free. read this tutorial if you want to do the same: how i sped up my website by 362% in under 10 minutes. conclusion optimizing your on-page seo is very important. and the best part is, it’s easy. anybody can use go through this tutorial and implement these techniques even if they’re not an experienced seo. although writing high quality content and building strong backlinks are what mainly help you rank higher, you can’t forget to optimize your pages for your keywords. for a lot of websites i’ve come across out there, it’ll be all you need to do to drastically improve your search rankings. facebook twitter pinterest you might also like... 31 examples of successful blogs: the most popular blogs in every industry what to look for when buying an affiliate website how this blog makes money: the exact business model behind the rankxl blog explained 91 comments reply ray october 17, 2015 at 8:40 pm great article. you said that wikipedia uses ‘no follow links’ when linking to other people’s websites. do you recommend that we do the same and use ‘no follow’ links when linking to other people’s websites? regards, ray reply chris lee october 17, 2015 at 8:47 pm thanks ray. it depends on your preference, but i only use it when i’m linking to something irrelevant to the topic of the article. for everything else, i use dofollow. reply mike s october 18, 2015 at 12:38 pm nice job here chris. thank you. your link to the seopressor5 article includes a link to their lsi kw generator. very handy. question – do you use schema markup to boost the seo potential of your web sites? i’ve been hearing alot about schema lately. mike reply chris lee october 18, 2015 at 4:10 pm thanks, mike. i don’t use it unless it’s the type of content that should be using it like reviews. reply jesus rodriguez october 19, 2015 at 4:59 pm a masterpiece of great content, i really enjoy “a lot” reading this article, there is so helpful information there, please don´t stop writing for the good future of the internet and marketing community, and pd: do it more often ” please”. reply chris lee october 19, 2015 at 8:41 pm thanks, jesus 🙂 reply david october 19, 2015 at 7:33 pm great article as always. gave me a lot of inspiration! reply chris lee october 19, 2015 at 8:40 pm happy to hear that 🙂 thanks, david. reply sutarto eko october 19, 2015 at 7:57 pm nice article, i am curious of with wikipedia that almost always dominate the search results of a keyword that i seek. please, more details again to discuss wikipedia, i will be waiting for him. reply chris lee october 19, 2015 at 8:40 pm thanks, sutarto. reply maximillian heth october 19, 2015 at 9:22 pm excellent article, chris! wikipedia truly is every other seo’s competitor and a great role model at at that for what google’s looking for. mike s – regarding schema, i think that would best for local seo or sites where you’re actively trying to sell a product or service of some sort or maybe promote a book or movie. you’ll see schema on lots of ecommerce sites, for example, and that would make sense because you want people to see things like price, review snippets, sizes, etc., especially when you manage to pop up in the top 10. from what i’ve gathered regarding google’s take on and intent for schema, onsite schema won’t boost your rank but it can increase your overall click-through rate, which will no doubt boost your rank. reply chris lee october 20, 2015 at 8:36 am thanks, maximillian. great input on schema as well! reply mike s october 24, 2015 at 2:40 pm maximillian and chris, thanks for your information on schema markup. although there’s some talk about schema on the interwebs for some time, i never really knew where or why it was necessary. i have a better understanding now. reply chris lee october 25, 2015 at 6:03 pm no problem mike! reply dollie march 9, 2017 at 3:43 am your posting is abtoeuslly on the point! chris lee march 16, 2017 at 11:45 am thank you dollie 🙂 reply muhammad usman october 20, 2015 at 12:57 am hi chris, i was waiting for your post. now i have read your post. well, you breakdown the wikipedia onsite seo that really help others. wikipedia is great source of information as well creating backlinks to get traffic. i have one question : does micro niche blogs still work? thanks reply chris lee october 20, 2015 at 8:37 am thanks muhammad 🙂 not as well as before, but i’ve seen people make it work for them. but the model is not as profitable anymore, because it’s easier to scale it up from there rather than start a new site. reply nick october 20, 2015 at 4:57 am another excellent article chris. your approach is refreshingly simple, and looks great for long term growth. thanks nick reply chris lee october 20, 2015 at 8:37 am thanks, nick 🙂 reply jack october 20, 2015 at 6:30 am hi chris, awesome cool article. what’s the internal linking plugin you use.? reply chris lee october 20, 2015 at 8:38 am thanks, jack. i don’t use any plugin for internal linking. i just go through it and add in links where it’s relevant. reply swayam october 20, 2015 at 7:09 am hi chris, i have been following your blog since you published the tutorial series on adsense 🙂 i have 2 queries for you – 1. is there any limit to using internal links in a post? i think i read somewhere that too much of internal linking is considered spam. 2. should i dofollow all my internal links and nofollow the outbound links? thank you for the awesome updates! reply chris lee october 20, 2015 at 8:40 am hey swayam. 1. nope. i don’t see it being a problem. just don’t go too overboard with it and add links where it’s not relevant. 2. it’s up to you whether to nofollow outbound links. i prefer to dofollow them. no need to nofollow internal links, though. reply jack october 20, 2015 at 6:05 pm hey chris. great read. so, it’s not a good idea to add your target kw in the h2 title? is it ok to use an lsi in that case or just try to make as natural sounding a title as possible? reply chris lee october 21, 2015 at 5:36 am hey jack. you should just focus on making it as natural as possible. reply anish october 21, 2015 at 6:33 am chris, its a great article. thanks for it reply chris lee october 21, 2015 at 3:52 pm thanks for reading, anish 🙂 reply marcel october 24, 2015 at 2:54 am great post! i’ve booked marked it so that’s anotherl ink to your site. 🙂 seriously, i internal link already but i will take this weekend to go through my informational pages and make sure that i internal link where i can to my sales pages and vice versa. i like the header tag info as well. oh, my other task this weekend (since i am alone as the wife and kids are away) is to read more articles on this site and implement them. thanks chris! reply chris lee october 25, 2015 at 6:04 pm thanks marcel 🙂 reply madhu prasad october 24, 2015 at 5:25 am i get a lot of valuable information from your blog. this article is a fully power pack info and you have highlighted the wikipedia strategy, which is very helpful for beginners likes us. hope you come up with more post like this. reply chris lee october 25, 2015 at 6:03 pm thanks madhu 🙂 reply mike october 26, 2015 at 12:27 am hey chris any reply for my post above?

will i not get punished by google if i do it moderately? reply chris lee october 27, 2015 at 8:31 am sure you can! it could drive some traffic. as long as you don’t use software to mass comment spam, you should be okay. reply mike october 30, 2015 at 9:26 am hey chris just wanted to confirm you received my email reply chris lee october 30, 2015 at 4:37 pm got it. sent you a reply just now. mike november 5, 2015 at 11:55 am hey chris how many outreach emails do you or your va typically send in a day?

how many times is the heading h2 & h3 tags should be for onpage seo to get the best ranking on google? reply chris lee january 25, 2016 at 3:10 am h1 should be used once – for your title. h2’s should be used for your sub-sections – and any sub-sections under your sub-sections should be with h3’s. reply shueqrt february 7, 2016 at 2:29 am thanks chris, great article! i’ve been reading your blog for several months now. i learned a lot from all of your writings and help me improve blog niche sites. reply chris lee february 7, 2016 at 5:34 pm glad to hear that 🙂 reply mike april 7, 2016 at 10:39 am hey chris, i’m learning a lot on this site, so thanks for the effort you have put in creating it. having just started my site, i’m finding that i’m going well over 2,000 words when writing about a topic and covering it in its entirety. articles end up being 7,000-10,000 words long. while i’m sure that this is good for ranking purposes, particularly in getting others to share your content, as it is so in-depth, my worry is about adsense clicks. if an article is so long and you’re only allowed to show a maximum of 3 ads, won’t content being so long reduce ctr significantly? reply chris lee april 11, 2016 at 11:13 pm hey mike, for most articles, the best performing ad will always be the first one in your content area (usually above or right below the first paragraph) so that one will always perform the same regardless of the length underneath it. yeah, it could reduce ctr for other ad blocks, but the benefits of having a long, in-depth article for link building, shares, and long-tail traffic is far greater. reply kannan january 27, 2017 at 2:19 am the best in-depth explanation i ever have seen before. thanks for completion. i will follow your tips in my blog reply chris lee january 30, 2017 at 8:41 pm awesome 🙂 reply akash may 2, 2018 at 3:54 pm great article as always thanks once again. 🙂 reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 12:41 pm thanks akash! reply zack may 2, 2018 at 4:16 pm nice article – this was super accessible. i’ve been avoiding really digging into on-page seo for awhile and instead just following yoast’s recommendations. seems like your advice pretty much aligns with theirs, with the exception being keyword density. i’m glad to hear it’s not something i need to stress too much about. reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 12:41 pm glad to hear that zack 🙂 reply vin may 2, 2018 at 5:07 pm what up, chris!??! it’s been a while.. this is so on point. great job. have you messed around with tf*idf at all for onsite optimization? i’ve been doing so for a little while at it helps a lot. i’ll optimize my page as you’ve described here…and then i’ll go back a few months later (if it’s not already on first page) and use a tf*idf tool to help fine tune the text. this usually bumps me up to the first page. also – i just did a whoooole blog post just on writing content based on the intent of the target keyword. here that is: https://seo.institute/content-creation-user-intent/ (feel free to delete the link – just wanted to show you) reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 12:46 pm hey vin! great to see you here 🙂 i haven’t, but sounds interesting. just checked out your blog post and it’s awesome! great write up! i think search intent is getting more and more important, and i’m glad to see you dove in deeply about it here. reply mo saleem may 2, 2018 at 6:51 pm awesome write-up chris. my action step from this article is to go back to my previous articles and seek out all the places where i can add links to my newer articles. is it true that including in-page links can increase your changes of showing up for the featured snipped in google? reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 12:50 pm thanks mo! from my experience, it doesn’t seem to help you show up in featured snippets from that alone. but you do get these nifty links under your meta description: reply dennis may 2, 2018 at 7:35 pm hi, chris thanks for this awesome article. i can’t tell you how much this helps me when writing my content. i always write for the reader, not just search. i use lsi keywords naturally throughout my content. after reading this, i now know that i have been using my h1 and 2- 3 tags properly. i love reading your blog. i know when you email me it’s going to be great content. i sorry i don’t comment often i’m just learning. thanks, again. reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 12:51 pm thanks a lot for the kind words, dennis! reply manish may 2, 2018 at 11:27 pm nice infomation sir… helpfull topic reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 12:51 pm thanks! reply anthony may 3, 2018 at 3:35 am thanks chris some very nice reminders about on-page seo. good point about not over-doing the keywords in h2 titles and alt tags. i should keep an eye on how i do this. cheers reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 12:51 pm glad to hear it helped, anthony! reply chidi may 3, 2018 at 4:41 am one of the best article i have come across. good work reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 12:51 pm thanks for checking it out! reply aniekan may 3, 2018 at 10:20 am thanks a lot for this article! you have been a blessing to my seo journey. reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 12:52 pm happy to hear that 😀 reply markjame may 3, 2018 at 2:56 pm you are the best guider. your blogs are amazing.perfect way to explain onsite seo. reply chris lee may 3, 2018 at 7:35 pm thank you! reply bhuboy may 7, 2018 at 3:09 am thanks for this very useful tutorial cris reply chris lee may 12, 2018 at 3:41 pm thanks for reading! reply adam may 7, 2018 at 5:18 am really annoying that there isn’t any indication of the date this was written / edited / whatever. i know it makes it easier for you, but it’s a horrible user experience. reply chris lee may 12, 2018 at 3:40 pm sorry about that, adam 🙁 reply mohit gangrade may 25, 2018 at 12:51 am hey chris, just bookmarked this guide. unlike most of the guides on on-page seo, yours is very simple and detailed. trying to add additional keywords to the title tag is always a great idea. that way you can rank for double the long-tail keywords. 🙂 you started the title of this post with “on-page seo tutorial.” do you think it still helps to put the main keyword in the beginning? i used to spend 20-40 minutes writing the meta description, but as you mentioned, google doesn’t value it as much as it used to. these days i spend less than 10 minutes. how much time do you spend crafting the meta description? do you use a template for meta descriptions on your niche sites? i try to use the keyword in the first few sentences of my introduction, but don’t you think bolding the keyword is going a bit too far? i have heard a lot of seo “experts” say that it’s no longer a good practice. what do you think? do you email big brands like moz after linking out to them in your articles? or do you only do that for one or two-person blogs? keep up the great work! thanks, mohit gangrade reply chris lee june 19, 2018 at 9:04 am great questions, mohit. every answer is along the same line: when it makes sense to do so. nothing is do or die. thanks for reading 🙂 reply ruffin byenda june 5, 2018 at 6:34 am i am new in the blog and i just learned some good stuff on your site, i just made my twenty-second article but i did not know all the things that must be done to be well referenced. really thank you reply chris lee june 19, 2018 at 8:59 am glad it helped! reply john october 27, 2018 at 5:54 am thanks for the amazing tutorials your blog in heaven sent. hope to build up my blog and niche site and my goal to to get a case study post here in rankxl 🙂 reply chris lee october 27, 2018 at 11:56 pm thanks john! reply james november 6, 2018 at 8:27 am hi chris, should we use rel=”nofollow” for external links? how to use rel attribute the right way? thanks reply chris lee december 2, 2018 at 12:08 pm no need to nofollow them unless the links are irrelevant to the content. reply ravi kumar december 2, 2018 at 6:47 am thanks, chris lee for sharing such a very helpful information. reply chris lee december 2, 2018 at 12:03 pm glad it helped, ravi! reply alvin charles june 16, 2019 at 4:06 am thanks for this article. i really learn few onpage seo points. hope you add few more tips in future reply david smoothstack june 17, 2019 at 8:47 pm how can you put h1 tag on a title?
