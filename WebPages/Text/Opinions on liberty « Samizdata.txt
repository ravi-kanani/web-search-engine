1828 are not wasting their time trying to influence the conservative party – despite what steve davies says brian micklethwait (london) · activism · education & academia · media & journalism · opinions on liberty · political economy · uk affairs tomorrow evening, i am hosting a talk at my home which will be given by jack powell. here’s the short biographical note that powell sent me, to send out to my email list of potential attenders: jack powell founded 1828, which is a new neoliberal news and opinion website, to champion freedom, especially within british conservative politics. he is the editor of the website as well as being in his final year at king’s college london, studying spanish and portuguese. interesting guy. here is the link to the 1828 website. in the spiel about his talk that followed, powell goes on to say that 1828 is especially trying to champion freedom in british universities. what this actually means is that he’ll be operating in the territory where politicians and students come together, to think about the bigger picture. an important spot in the political landscape, i think. in general, powell’s blurb for his talk abounds with ambition, energy, enthusiasm, attention to detail, and also with the names of conservative party politicians (liz truss, priti patel) and media organisations (capx, guido, quillette, new statesman) with whom 1828 has had dealings and who have said good things about the efforts that powell and the rest of the 1828 team have been making. i have spent my libertarian life so far trying to spread libertarianism way beyond the merely party political arena, an approach which paid off big time when the internet arrived, in the form of such wonders as, well, samizdata. but part of the reason i did that was that when i started out being a libertarian activist, it seemed to me that too many people were doing only party politics, and not enough people were trumpetting broader and undiluted libertarian principles to the wider world. there was not nearly enough proclaiming of the libertarian “metacontext”, as we here like to put it. but ever since that earlier time, the last two decades of the previous century basically, the conservative party, and in particular its youth membership, has moved away from those freedom-oriented principles and towards the as-much-government-as-we-can-afford-and-then-some position. i am very glad that people like jack powell are now trying to reverse that trend. recently, and i’m not changing the subject, i attended a talk given by steve davies, in which he talked, as he frequently does these days, about political realignment. in particular, davies has long been noticing a definite shift by the conservative party away from free market policies and towards economic dirigisme. this shift, he says, is no mere whim of the people who happen to have been leading the party. he sees a deeper trend in action. so, does that mean that jack powell and his fellow 1828-ers are wasting their time talking to and listening to conservative politicians? my short answer is: no, they are not. i say this not because i assume that davies is wrong about where he sees the conservatives going. i now suspect that he exaggerates this shift somewhat, but the policy direction he sees is the direction i also see, as, now, do many others. but that doesn’t mean that 1828-ers communing with truss, patel and also with the likes of the recently resigned chancellor sajid javid and with the likes of steve baker won’t count for anything. when politics goes through upheavals of the sort that davies now observes, this doesn’t mean that all the politicians who lose internal battles within their parties just vanish. some do, but others often hang around and find new party settings to operate in, new allies to collaborate with. davies himself said this in his talk, and offered historical examples of just such behaviour, by william gladstone for example. therefore, any time and effort that the 1828-ers spend talking to, listening to and generally cheering on freedom-sympathetic politicians could end up being very significant, no matter what happens to the broader political landscape. you can never be entirely sure, but neither sajid javid nor steve baker seem to me like they are about to just fade away without any more fight. baker in particular, fresh from his brexit agonies and ecstasies, is now making all sorts of promising noises. scroll down, for instance, to the bottom of this piece, where it says: the outgoing erg chair has said he wanted to focus more on constituents and that it was time for him to “return to certain economic issues which i consider as least as important to the future of the country as exiting the eu”. the writer of the piece, david scullion, adds: the wycombe mp is known to be critical of the current system of global finance and what he sees as the problems of keynesian ‘easy money’. if you doubt baker’s continuing commitment to such ideas, just listen to what he starts saying about two thirds of the way through this very recent interview with scullion. that’s the same link twice, but that’s not the half of what it deserves. really, seriously. as i believe they say on american battleships: now hear this! now hear this! not many politicians have major impact on two huge issues in one career and in one lifetime, but if i had to pick someone who might be about to score two out of two, i’d now bet on baker. so, whatever jack powell and his 1828 mates manage to accomplish in the years to come, it is likely to do some good. listening to him talk about that tomorrow evening will be very interesting. february 27th, 2020 | 8 comments i hope so natalie solent (essex) · civil liberty & regulation · opinions on liberty · privacy & panopticon · sexuality · twitter nonsense · uk affairs harry miller: “this is a warershed moment for liberty” the police response to an ex-officer’s allegedly transphobic tweets was unlawful, the high court has ruled. harry miller, from lincolnshire, was contacted by humberside police in january last year after a complaint about his tweets. he was told he had not committed a crime, but it would be recorded as a non-crime “hate incident”. the court found the force’s actions were a “disproportionate interference” on his right to freedom of expression. in a separate story from the one i quote above, the bbc goes on to report that mr justice julian knowles said the effect of police turning up at mr miller’s place of work “because of his political opinions must not be underestimated”. he added: “to do so would be to undervalue a cardinal democratic freedom. “in this country we have never had a cheka, a gestapo or a stasi. we have never lived in an orwellian society.” i did not know we still had judges like that. edit: this is the text of the judgement: miller -v- college of policing, 14 february 2020. february 15th, 2020 | 28 comments

to defeat the chinese communists brian micklethwait (london) · activism · chinese affairs · economics, business & globalization · historical views · international affairs · opinions on liberty how can the hongkongers defeat the chinese communists (hereinafter termed chicoms), and preserve their hongkonger way of life approximately as it now is? in the short run, they probably can’t. during the next few months, the chicom repression in hong kong will surely get ever nastier, and the bigger plan, to just gobble it up and digest it into chicom china will surely bash onwards. but then again, i thought that these hong kong demonstrations would all be snuffed out months ago. so what the hell do i know? i thought they’d just send in the tanks, and to hell with “world opinion”. but the chicoms, it turned out, didn’t want to just kill everyone who dared to disobey, plus anyone else who happened to be standing about nearby. that would not be a good look for them. what are they? russians? far too unsophisticated. instead the plan has been to divide and conquer, and it presumably still is. by putting violent agent provovateurs in among the demonstrators, and by ramping up the violence simultaneously perpetrated by the police, the plan was, and is, to turn the peaceful and hugely well attended demonstrations into far smaller, far more violent street battles of the sort that would disgust regular people. who would then turn around and support law and order, increased spending on public housing, blah blah. so far, this has not worked. and for as long as any chicom plan for hong kong continues not to work, “world opinion” has that much more time to shake itself free from the sneer quotes and get itself organised, to try to help hong kong to stay semi-free. those district rat-catcher (or whatever) elections last sunday came at just the wrong time for the chicoms, because they gave peaceful hongkongers the chance to make their opinions known, about creatures of a far more significant sort than rats, and at just the time when the chicom plan should have started seriously shutting the hongkongers up. these elections were a landslide. the chicoms are very keen to exude indifference to world opinion, but they clearly do care about it, because if they truly didn’t care about it, those tanks would have gone in months ago, just as i had assumed they would. so, since world opinion clearly has some effect, the first thing the rest of us can do to help the hongkongers is to keep our eyeballs on hong kong. as i say, i continue to be pessimistic about the medium-term future in hong kong. but in the longer run, if the hongkongers can’t have a local victory, they can set about getting their revenge. and all of the rest of us who care can join in and help them. we, the hongkongers and all their supporters around the world, can start talking seriously about toppling the chicoms, not just by continuing to contest hong kong, but also by talking about china as a whole. if the chicoms won’t let hong kong be, then the hongkongers have a perfect right to start talking about china as a whole, since that’s what is now trying to swallow them up. if they aren’t allowed the distinct and distinctly better system that they were promised, then the only system they are allowed becomes fair game for their complaints and for their recommendations. that’s a claim that will make sense to anyone able to think for themselves. it won’t persuade the chicoms, but persuading everyone else in the world with a clutch of honest brain cells to rub together is a fine start. what needs to happen is some re-framing. → continue reading: how to defeat the chinese communists november 28th, 2019 | 77 comments - (comments are closed) what if the berlin wall hadn’t come down? brian micklethwait (london) · eastern europe · economics, business & globalization · historical views · opinions on liberty · russia i have always been interested in the what if? question that consists of asking how the world would have been different had the berlin wall not fallen and had the ussr just blundered onwards indefinitely, still being the ussr. that’s a question that has long intrigued me, ever since the wall in question actually did fall. as you can tell from how i phrase the question, i am damn near certain that the world would have been a far grimmer place than it now is, had that horrible structure not been trashed or turned into souvenir fragments. but, beyond noting with approval the way that various eastern european former soviet possessions have become much freer and less poor, i have never taken the time to think through the details of this feeling. how might western public opinion have developed, had the wall remained? how would the world as a whole have been different? so, i was very interested to learn yesterday about an iea event, which i have already signed up to attend, to be held at the end of this month: this month sees the 30th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall, ushering in dramatic change across east and west germany. but even now, east germany still lags behind the west and the legacy of socialism has been hard to overcome. so what would have happened if the wall hadn’t come down? on thursday 28th november, the iea is delighted to host an intriguing discussion on that very premise. professor syed kamall will chair the conversation with our own head of political economy dr. kristian niemietz, and historians roger moorhouse and giles udy. rather than just bang on with more guess-answers, i will keep this posting brief and await comments from others. in particular, are there any ways in which the fall of the berlin wall has made the world worse? i’m not talking about how it has embarrassed communists and (a tribe i particularly despise) anti-anti-communists … like that’s a bad thing. those are just two of many features. i’m talking about how life for regular people around the world, and perhaps also in russia itself, may actually, in some weird knock-on effect ways, have been made worse. i can’t think of any obvious ways that anything like that has happened, but maybe someone else can. november 19th, 2019 | 33 comments - (comments are closed) the anti-saloon league is back natalie solent (essex) · health & medical · historical views · north american affairs · opinions on liberty · self ownership “prohibition showed bans can be good for us”, writes david aaronovitch in the times. unironically. he means it. he thinks prohibition was good and wants it back. i suppose it was ever thus; it is like the way that when the people who remember the last banking crash die the banks start crazy lending again. mr aaronovitch writes, your mental charge sheet against prohibition may well include the accusation that it didn’t get rid of drinking but sent it underground; that the resulting appetite for “bootlegged” liquor led to the rise of organised criminal syndicates, al capone, the mob and the st valentine’s day massacre; that it helped to make corrupt hypocrites out of public servants; that the rich were able to indulge while the poor were criminalised. why yes, it does. and after just a few years the americans saw what a disaster it was and repealed it. it may not improve your view of it to know that the ku klux klan were very much in favour of prohibition. that does not surprise me. strangely though, the one question that almost no one seems to ask of this epic public health measure is whether or not it actually improved public health. yet it doesn’t take much digging into the available statistics to discover that it did — quite a lot, in fact. excessive alcohol consumption is linked to all kinds of adverse health conditions. the most obvious is alcoholic cirrhosis (or scarring) of the liver. in 1911 the death rate for cirrhosis among american men was nearly 30 per 100,000. by 1929 that had been reduced by more than 30 per cent. registered admissions to mental hospitals for psychosis linked to alcohol more than halved. even by 1933, when volstead was revoked, alcohol consumption had gone down by a third since pre-prohibition. whatever mark twain may have written, prohibition saved many, many lives. the commenters made several good points to contradict that assertion. some pointed out that in the same period alcohol consumption also went down other countries, including the uk, where alcohol continued to be legal. bryan dale said, “if prohibition reduced alcohol consumption by a third that can hardly be called a success. it was supposed to eliminate it entirely after all. with 2/3 as much alcohol being illegally consumed as had been done legally before prohibition, the impact on respect for the law must have been dreadful.” others described well-stocked drinks cabinets in modern saudi arabia, or the way that the type of alcohol consumed shifts from beer to spirits when it must be sold and transported illegally. i expect readers of this site can supply many other historical and factual arguments. all i will say is that there is a void at the heart of the passage i quoted above. mr aaronovitch never even questions the assumption that it is for him and people like him to decide what other human beings may or may not put in their own bodies. november 3rd, 2019 | 65 comments - (comments are closed) it is past time for a hayek statue brian micklethwait (london) · activism · opinions on liberty · political economy · uk affairs i agree with this, from matt kilcoyne of the adam smith institute. it is past time that nobel prize-winning economist and great social thinker, f a hayek, had a statue in london. hayek is one of the greatest modern economists, and while his intellectual presence in academia is extraordinary, it is time for his legacy to be extended to the greater public. hayek traced the idea of spontaneous order from adam smith’s ‘invisible hand’ to the present day. he made it one of the most important underpinnings of social and economic freedom. he also made groundbreaking contributions on trade cycle theory and policy, competition in currency, and even human psychology. a physical memorial would not only honour him directly, it would also bring his name and presence before people who do not yet know of his books and his ideas, and prompt people to find out more about his output and his wide intellectual influence. i have become very bored of people saying that “now is the time” for xyz, when in truth it should have happened a long time ago. so he had me at “it is past time …”, even if the wording seems a bit clumsy. it has long (see paragraph 2 above) been “time for his legacy to be extended to the greater public”. i hope that, if this statue happens, it’s a good one. i look forward to taking photos of it. october 25th, 2019 | 17 comments - (comments are closed) socialism is socialism until it turns nasty (because if it’s nasty it can’t be socialism) brian micklethwait (london) · economics, business & globalization · mindless "inequality" blather · opinions on liberty via instapundit, a tweet: rand paul: “well if you vote for a socialist, you might get socialism”. ana navarro: “maduro is not a socialist. he’s a corrupt, murderous thug who is starving his people.” but maduro is – or certainly was – a socialist. and, he’s a corrupt, murderous thug who is starving his people. as instapundit might say, kristian niemietz smiles. earlier this year, niemietz did one of my last friday of the month talks, on the subject of his recent book about how socialists think and act – “it’s socialism”, “it’s not socialism” – every time, time after time. read the book for a ton of patiently assembled chapter-and-verse details along these lines. the point niemietz made that i especially liked was how socialists simultaneously define socialism by its processes, and by its outcomes. so, socialism begins with socialist processes – stealing the property of property owners, goodies for the poor, fixing prices in accordance with a central plan, taking over corporations and replacing capable corporate managers with party hacks, monopolising the media, and so on – therefore it’s obviously socialism. but then it turns nasty – far worse poverty than before, violent repression, corruption, savage inequality, and so on – therefore, equally obviously, it can’t be socialism. that we critics of socialism had predicted exactly these outcomes from these processes doesn’t register. only the obvious non-socialism of what had earlier and equally obviously been socialism registers. i sort of knew all this, of course i did. but niemietz explained it better – “socialism also defined by its outcomes” – than i’ve ever heard it explained before. or then again, maybe i just got there myself, and he merely said for me the thought i had arrived at.
