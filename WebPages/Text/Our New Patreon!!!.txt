(and yes, we‚Äôll keep this going even after the crisis has subsided.) situations like this make you look at things differently. we were already moving toward a more community-centric model with our events. the coronavirus is just expediting that process, and this new membership program is the next phase of that. the team and i really appreciate anything you can do to help us ride out the storm. we‚Äôre going keep trucking on and creating content that you can use for when we can travel again. thank you so much for everything and for helping us get through this weird period! ‚Äì nomadic matt book your trip: logistical tips and tricks book your flight find a cheap flight by using skyscanner or momondo. they are my two favorite search engines, because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. book your accommodation you can book your hostel with hostelworld as they have the largest inventory. if you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use booking.com, as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. i use them all the time. don‚Äôt forget travel insurance travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. it‚Äôs comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. i never go on a trip without it, as i‚Äôve had to use it many times in the past. i‚Äôve been using world nomads for ten years. my favorite companies that offer the best service and value are: world nomads (for everyone below 70) insure my trip (for those 70 and over) looking for the best companies to save money with?

that just seems weird to me‚Ä¶ and you do realize that practically everyone is hurting financially right now with millions of jobs being lost? you‚Äôre not the only one affected by this. anyway, i appreciate your website but i am just shocked that you would be asking for donation at this delicate time in the world. jose reply rodrigo march 19, 2020 at 2:21 pm where did matt say he had coronavirus? but you‚Äôre right, this is not a good look for matt. he is completely out of touch with reality. reply salim march 19, 2020 at 11:32 pm he sent an email. when/where did he state he was getting over a million just on this? ‚Äúinquiring minds wanna know‚Äù.. reply salim march 19, 2020 at 11:35 pm ‚Äújose, can you see?‚Äù-) [for the non-americans, this is a mirthy take on the star spangled banner;-] (full disclosure, i‚Äôm latino also;-) kidding aside, where/when did matt stated about the ‚Äò7 figures‚Äô? you wanna make a serious allegation, so have to be prepared to back it up.. reply kevin march 20, 2020 at 2:07 am the business might generate 7 figures in revenue but that is not the same as profit. if they also spend 7 figures (he has like 5 staff members, for example) then it‚Äôs possible to make 7 figures but generate little or no profit. and patreon is not for donations. it‚Äôs not a go fund me type platform. it‚Äôs a platform for creators to share content and get support directly from their community. reply nomadicmatt march 20, 2020 at 11:38 am i know it doesn‚Äôt always seem like it but this website is not just me. we have 5 staff (one with two kids) as well as freelancers we hire and pay. i‚Äôm not just sitting on a small stack of money asking for more. like everyone else in the industry, we are a small business trying to keep the lights on. like everyone else, we don‚Äôt keep a lot of cash around. it gets reinvested in our business, charity, and employees. we have zero income. pretty soon, we too will be the ones that will end up unemployed too. reply kathy sadler march 20, 2020 at 3:02 pm i love nomadic matt and have bought a couple of his books and have learned so much about inexpensive ways to travel on my tight , tight budget and am sorry he is laid up with the virus! thank you, matt, from kathy in canada! ? reply jeroen vogel march 22, 2020 at 7:14 pm is it weird, matt, that people respond this way? the tone of this article is one in which a business owner, who elsewhere boasts about his mouthwatering revenue, now seeks financial help in a time where millions are a struggling. there‚Äôs nothing wrong with setting up a patreon account, but it might‚Äôve been better to present it as an option for your readers to get more out of their ‚Äònomadic matt experience.‚Äô it‚Äôs really just the tone of this article, victimizing oneself, that‚Äôs the problem. you might want to change that. reply nomadicmatt march 23, 2020 at 12:30 pm while revenue does not equal income, that is fair criticism on the wording of the post. i‚Äôll give it a reread. reply jeroen march 25, 2020 at 4:28 am it‚Äôs up to you what you do with it. being dutch, my own wording in english comes across harsher than its meant to. i mean well, constructively. you‚Äôre a lot braver than i am: i feel a lot more secure being on a payroll beside my (dutch) travel writing. reply dorsey march 23, 2020 at 9:12 am matt, i appreciate the content as i am in the beginning stages of really traveling more. for the concerned citizens who think it‚Äôs absurd for matt to ask for donations, stay off his page! is it now ok for us to enjoy everything without cost?! i will be donating! matt, is a blessing to travelers all around this world. godspeed matt! reply matt march 23, 2020 at 3:56 pm hey matt, great initiative, i hope it works out! looking into this right now, as your patreon is very affordable and offers perks! take care, matt reply leave a comment cancel reply by posting a comment, you agree to our community friendly, anti-spam comment policy that can be found here. get my best stuff sent straight to you! send me tips about us about matt copyright privacy policy contact write for us travel tips start here travel blog destination guides guidebooks community travel forum book club flyte travel media courses book your trip accommodation cheap flights travel insurance travel credit cards favorite companies search follow me on the web facebook twitter instagram pinterest copyright ¬© 2020 ¬∑ nomadic matt‚Äôs travel site
