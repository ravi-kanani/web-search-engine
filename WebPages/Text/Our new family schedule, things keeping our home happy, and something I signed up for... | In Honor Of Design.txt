(markers, stickers, activity packs, etc.) they can earn money through dollar chores all week. dollar chores are optional extra chores they can choose to do such as cleaning sinks, sweeping, washing windows, folding a basket of laundry, etc. this has been a big motivation for them, and i like how it teaches them responsibility, contributing to a team environment, save vs. spend, etc. free audible books – audible is offering free books for kids right now which is an awesome alternative to screens (since they are having to do so much of that for online learning). i got these supplies from a local art store, but here are similar ones: watercolors, brushes, paper pads a few things i am doing to stay mentally strong: make something – i started watercoloring again last month after years of keeping paints in storage. it was like dusting off an old record that still played music that i had forgotten about. it was good timing, because now that i am forced to be still i can do this with my kids (and hopefully share some easy projects along the way for you all too). i signed up for a master class! i know for me, using my creative brain is essential for staying well. i signed up for on master class because it was only $15 a month for access to several classes. i can’t wait to learn about new topics. currently listening to a few already from sara blakely and kelly wearstler. move your body – another thing i know is vital for gabe and i not to totally go stir crazy, and to stay strong for our kids is exercise. i am getting up an hour before the kids wake (if chiara sleeps well of course) to get in a morning walk and prayer. if you aren’t able to get outside, might i suggest a punching bag? no, seriously. we are hanging one in our garage. whatever you need to do to move your body and relieve stress! temporary work station we set up on our kitchen table for their virtual lessons. thankful we had this computer from when i was a freelance graphic designer. sticking to a routine – everyone around the world has a new normal, including our kids. we are all adjusting to this sudden shift. having even a loose routine can establish a sense of normalcy and peace. our current family schedule: 7:00 – gabe and i wake up to prepare for the day, and get a head start on the kids. 8:00 – breakfast and clean up 8:30 – gabe starts school with the kids, i set up activities or music time with the little ones. 10:30 – break (outside if possible for fresh air) 11:00 – resume school and learning activities for little ones 12:00 – lunch 12:30 – older ones resume school, little ones have nap/rest time. (this is when gabe and i squeeze in a chunk of working on the house to prep to sell or blog work.) 3:00 – outdoor or basement play 5:00 – dinner prep and clean up 6:30 – show or movie time 7:30 – bedtime routine 8:30 – gabe and i are using this time to relax if we can, but also have to use it to work for the time being. we are fighting extra hard for quality time together knowing how vital that is for the peace of the home to remain. it’s a lot of learning as we go right now, and to be honest the “working from home” thing is really challenging as we no longer have the pockets of time we did when the kids were in school. we are practicing extreme social distancing so we don’t have the extra child care help we usually do from my mom as well. this is why we most likely be using some after hours to develop content here as best we can. however, i also have a lot of hope that things will all be ok. i trust that this too shall pass. what are some things you are enjoying this week? much love, and happy weekend! you may also like around here: christmas edition birthday blessings the direction of ihod – an update! leave a comment (cancel) laura march 22, 2020 you turn your sacrifice beans into jelly beans?! that’s brilliant! yes, “this too shall pass!” god bless! reply anna liesemeyer march 22, 2020 i have never seen max more motivated. ha ha! reply ← older post newer post → instagram facebook pinterest youtube bloglovin the ihod shop: clean skin care + makeup favorites happening on instagram: follow + archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 find us on pinterest: copyright © 2020 in honor of design. theme by maiden sites, site hosting by flywheel powered by chloédigital
