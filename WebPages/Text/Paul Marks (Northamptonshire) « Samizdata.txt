(comments are closed) destructionism – with a few british examples paul marks (northamptonshire) · best of samizdata.net · economics, business & globalization · opinions on liberty · uk affairs the last part of ludwig von mises great work socialism is entitled “destructionism” and is not, formally, about socialism at all. in the main body of “socialism” ludwig von mises proves that it is impossible (yes impossible) for socialism to equal capitalism economically, let alone to exceed capitalist economic performance (as socialists had been promising for over a hundred years) socialism must always produce inferior results. now the language of ludwig von mises may sometimes suggest that he believes that socialism can not function at all (i.e. that it can produce nothing – no goods and services), but that is a misinterpretation of the position of mises (which is partly the fault of mises himself – who sometimes lets elegant language get in the way of fully stating the correct position, as i detest such things as “grammar” i do not make this mistake). by copying the prices of the capital goods in “capitalist countries” socialist countries can make a crude approximation of “capitalist” economic activity – never very good, but certainly not no economic activity at all. however, in the last part of his work “socialism” ludwig von mises turns to “interventionism” government spending, taxes and regulations which (supposedly) improve on the work of voluntary cooperation. “market forces”, of supply and demand, are as my friend mr ed often points out – partly a matter of physical reality (weather and so on), but mostly a matter of human choices (voluntary interaction). government intervention (by spending, taxes and regulation) far from improving economic and social outcomes can (as herbert spencer pointed out in “man versus the state” in 1883) only make things worse than they otherwise would be. ludwig von mises takes great pains in “destructionism” to show that the fashionable polices of his time (and our own time) of government spending, taxes and regulations make things worse, not better, than they otherwise would be. and that the supposedly new idea of interventionism – is, in fact, a return to the absurd fallacies of past centuries that the classical economists of the had exposed. has the penny dropped, do politicians (and the public) yet understand that government spending, taxes and regulations make things worse (not better) than they otherwise would be? sadly no – most politicians and most of the public do not understand. → continue reading: destructionism – with a few british examples july 2nd, 2018 | 9 comments -

(comments are closed) the chinese-russian alliance is a clear and present danger to the west paul marks (northamptonshire) · international affairs the joint chinese-russian naval exercises presently going on in the northern pacific are presented as normal “we do this every year” – but they are clearly an anti american move, threatening japan and in support of north korea. although perhaps not the present dictator of north korea – the chinese-russian alliance may have someone else in mind for this role. from europe (the baltic states, and the ukraine, and everywhere else), to the middle east (the joint chinese-russian alliance with the islamic republic of iran and associated irregular forces such as the “party of god” in lebanon and syria), to the far east and the pacific, the alliance of the people’s republic of china and mr putin’s russia is a clear and present danger to the west. and everyone, apart from powerless people, is ignoring this danger. mr putin is not going anywhere – and he was trained, over many years, to hate the west – not for ideological reasons (he is not a marxist), but simply as an opponent who-must-be-defeated (the endless agitprop attacks from “rt” against the west show the obsession of mr putin). and the regime in china is thought of as a wonderful business opportunity, in spite of the fact that this mercantalist regime has run up massive trade surpluses for many years now – crippling the west with debt which the west has used to finance consumption not productive investment. the people’s republic of china’s true nature as an extremely aggressive nationalistic (han chinese ethnic supremacist) dictatorship bent on military modernisation and endless expansion taking-over-ever-more-lands-and-seas, is still not really understood. the prc is not a big version of taiwan – it is a ruthless dictatorship, bent upon expansion. of course the rising power of china is not in the long term interests of russia – but mr putin is myopic, his training has given him the view that the west is the great enemy of russia. he is focused on this mythical threat – and ignores the real long term threat, the people’s republic of china. indeed he is locked in an alliance with the prc against the west. september 21st, 2017 | 52 comments - (comments are closed) the moral divide in the german military and political elite during both world wars paul marks (northamptonshire) · historical views the conflict between german generals falkenhayn and ludendorff was over a lot more than military policy – indeed falkenhayn made some horrible mistakes in military tactics, for example allowing himself to be pushed into continuing the verdun offensive much longer than he intended (at least much longer than he later claimed had been his original intention), and insisting that general fritz von below recapture any position he lost to the british in the somme offensive – an order that led to terrible german casualties. the conflict may have been presented as a military one (between the “westerner” falkenhayn and the “easterner” lundendorff ) over whether to concentrate german military resources in the west or the east – but it was really a lot more than a dispute over military policy. nor was it really a dispute over the form of government – as neither falkenhayn or ludendorff was a democrat. it was fundamentally a moral (ethical) dispute. general lundendorff had absorbed (even more than kaiser wilhelm ii had) the moral relativism and historicism that had become fashionable in the german elite in the decades running up to the first world war – ideas that can be traced all the way back to (in their different ways) such philosophers as hegel and (far more) fichte, whereas general falkenhayn still clung to concepts of universal justice (morality) and rejected such things as the extermination or enslavement of whole races, and the destruction of historic civilisations such as that of russia. lundendorff, and those who thought like him, regarded falkenhayn as hopelessly reactionary – for example thinking in terms of making peace with russia on terms favourable to germany, rather than destroying russia and using the population as slaves. in the middle east falkenhayn came to hear of the ottoman turk plan to destroy the jews (as the armenian christians had been destroyed), and he was horrified by the plan and worked to frustrate it. advanced and progressive thinkers, such as ludnedorff, had great contempt for reactionaries such as falkenhayn who did not realise that ideas of universal justice and personal honour were “myths” only believed in by silly schoolgirls. falkenhayn even took christianity seriously, to lundendorff this was clearly the mark of an inferior and uneducated mind. and falkenhayn, for his part, came to think that his country (the germany that he so loved) was under the influence of monsters – although while their plans to exterminate or enslave whole races and to control (in utter tyranny) every aspect of peacetime (not just wartime) life remained theoretical, he never had to make the final break. the conflict continued into the next generation. famously admiral canaris (head of german military intelligence) became an enemy of the national socialists – not because he was a believer in a democratic form of government, but because he believed that the nazis were a moral outrage violating the most basic principles of universal truth and justice. but the point of view in germany opposed to men such as admiral canaris. the point of view that made itself felt in such things as the german declaration of war upon france in 1914 – a pack of lies, and (perhaps more importantly) a deliberately obvious pack of lies (in order to make a philosophical point – as the president of france, a philosopher, noticed at once), had long had nothing but contempt for the very idea of universal objective truth and justice. → continue reading: the moral divide in the german military and political elite during both world wars september 14th, 2017 | 27 comments - (comments are closed) the mistaken legal philosophy of mr damian green and the incorrectly named ‘great repeal bill’ paul marks (northamptonshire) · philosophical · uk affairs the de facto deputy prime minister of the united kingdom, mr damian green, has been doing the rounds of the television studios explaining why, in his opinion, all european union laws should be “incorporated” en bloc into british law. in a wonderful example of missing-the-point, the opposition (the bbc and so on) are complaining about everything – apart from what they should be complaining about. the ‘great repeal bill’ does not actually repeal any regulations – it turns european union regulations into british regulations, but it does not repeal them. it does not make them ‘void’ as the regulations of cromwell (for example banning christmas and punishing adultery by death) were declared ‘void’ en bloc in 1660. but why does mr green (and the prime minister – and others) think that european union regulations have to be ‘incorporated’ into british law – why not allow them to become void in march 2019 and return to the common law? the question is not really an administrative one, as mr green would claim, it actually goes to the heart of legal philosophy. to someone like mr green ‘the law’ means detailed regulations governing every aspect of economic life – to him the only alternative to this is chaos (people eating each other – or whatever). mr green has indeed heard of the common law (most certainly he has) – but the term ‘common law’ to a legal mind such as that of mr green means ‘the judgements of judges’, the rule of judges rather than the rule of law. i am reminded of a ‘dialogue between a philosopher and a student of the common laws of england‘ by thomas hobbes. the ‘philosopher’ is, of course, mr hobbes himself – and the defender of the common law is a made up character who is written by mr hobbes to lose the ‘dialogue’. to mr hobbes, as to mr green, ‘the law’ is just the ‘commands’ of someone (a legislature, or an official. or a judge), there is no sense in mr hobbes that ‘the law’ is a set of principles of natural justice that one tires to apply in everyday life (in individual cases). → continue reading: the mistaken legal philosophy of mr damian green and the incorrectly named ‘great repeal bill’ september 8th, 2017 | 17 comments - (comments are closed) british, indeed world, politics is dominated by the idea of ‘social reform’ – and this is an idea which violates basic economic law paul marks (northamptonshire) · economics, business & globalization · opinions on liberty what is “social reform”? social reform is the idea that increasing government spending and/or regulations reduces poverty or other “social ills” (sickness and so on) and it is the idea that has dominated british thinking since the late 19th century. liberal party “radical joe” chamberlain of birmingham (so beloved by prime minister may) outlined his program of using government to improve life (the central idea of “social reform”) in 1865 – but liberal party manchester had already taken over such things as the provision of water and gas and undertaken various other “social reforms” in the years after the act of 1835 set up modern local government in the cities and towns, replacing the old “closed corporations” – apart from in the one-square-mile city of london that has kept its closed corporation to this day. conservative party prime minister disraeli made it compulsory for local government to do about 40 social reforms (i.e. perpetual government spending functions) in 1875 – whether local tax payers wanted this or not. and j.s. mill stated in 1848 (in his “principles of political economy”) that “everyone agreed” (by which mr mill meant that he and his friends agreed – no opponent counted as part of “everyone”) that local government should do x,y, z, to help the people. liberal party prime minister gladstone agreed in 1870 that school boards be set up in most of the country (some towns, such as the one i am sitting in, refused to have one – but were forced to have one some 20 years later) to build state schools on the prussian model – although denying they would be like the prussian schools. and conservative party prime minister disraeli put unions above the common law in 1875 – by allowing “picketing” (obstruction) and giving the unions immunity from some claims of civil damage. this was part of the theory that wages and conditions of work should not be determined by the market (by supply and demand) but by “collective bargaining” – basically (as w.h. hutt explained in the “strike threat system”) of “give us what we want – or we will not allow people to go in or our of your place of business, at least we will make it very difficult for them to do so”. conservative party disraeli was a social reformer – he had no love for “capitalists” believing (or half believing) that they “exploited” people, and liberal party mr j. s. mill had much the same opinion (indeed a more radical one) – longing for the day when workers co-ops would replace the “capitalists”. since about 1870 the british state has grown – not just spending more money, but spending more money even as a proportion of the economy (leading to a rise in taxes over time). in the early 19th century the state, at least as a proportion of the economy shrank – since the 1870s it has grown. also the early 19th century witnessed deregulation – the repeal of various restrictions and edicts. from the 1870s onwards there has been a massive increase in regulation – with the state seeking to control every aspect of life, much the like the last years of queen elizabeth the first when there was an orgy of statute passing, often quite demented statutes such as the “statute of artificers” which tried to make everyone follow the occupation of their parents, there were also attempts to tie people to the parish of their birth and other throwbacks to the late roman empire (the emperor diocletian and all that). → continue reading: british, indeed world, politics is dominated by the idea of ‘social reform’ – and this is an idea which violates basic economic law august 22nd, 2017 | 21 comments -

(comments are closed) once established, it is almost impossible to repeal a benefit or ‘public service’ paul marks (northamptonshire) · north american affairs the failure to repeal obamacare is yet more evidence that chief justice roberts was wrong not to stop obamacare at the start – and wrong in his basic principles. the public rarely, if ever, ask for a new “public service” or benefit – but once such a government function is established it is almost impossible to repeal. people, and the system itself, grows used to the new government benefit or service – and it is incredibly difficult to get rid of it once it is established. this is why traditional constitutions are written – to limit the powers of government at the start, to prevent these benefits and services being created in the first place. however, a constitution is only as good as the enforcement mechanisms to make sure it is obeyed – and as luther martin warned at the constitutional convention in philadelphia, trusting government appointed judges to limit the powers of the very government that appointed them is a fatally flawed idea. this is not a recent problem. even in the 19th century the supreme court often ruled that the federal government has powers that the constitution does not give it. for example the infamous “second greenback case” where the supreme court, with newly appointed “justices” (appointed, in part, for this corrupt purpose) overturned the “first greenback case” where the court had declared, quite correctly, that the federal government has no power to print (or have printed) money – only to “coin money” (article one, section eight of the constitution of the united states) and that only gold or silver coin (not paper money) may be “legal tender” in any state (article one, section ten of the constitution of the united states). nothing could be plainer than that paper money is unconstitutional – indeed the very reason the united states constitution was written in the first place was to prevent the “not worth a continental” paper money issued by the continental congress to finance its government – those who support the articles of confederation system forget that one of its fundamental flaws was that it allowed the government to print money, as it gave no reliable source of taxation to finance the united states armed forces. without a large scale and professional armed forces there is no point in having a united states of america at all – and each state might as well go its own way till conquered by european powers in the 18th century or by the people’s republic of china in the 21st century. → continue reading: once established, it is almost impossible to repeal a benefit or ‘public service’ july 29th, 2017 | 84 comments -
