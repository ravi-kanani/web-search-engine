"...if not by his sensitivity": ie, there is no sensitivity to be impressed by. ✹ david quidnunc on 5 dec 2003 • link rooms in pepys's seething lane home in the diary, pepys sometimes used different names for the same room, but here's a list provided in liza picard's "restoration london." in the order in which pepys mentions them, "pepys seems to have had" the following: 1. study for himself 2. parlour 3. 'little room' taken over from his neighbor 4. room called 'nursery' in 1661 5. 'little green chamber where the maids lie' 6. elizabeth's bed chamber 7. dining room 8. 'our matted chamber' 9. new dining room in roof extension 10. elizabeth's closet 11. study for samuel's secretary 12. samuel's room 13. 'the red chamber' 14. 'the green chamber' 15. new closet for elizabeth in roof extension 16. upper best chamber, or music room 17. our dancing room 18. samuel's new closet 19. his 'old closet, now my little dining room' 20. 'the great chamber' 21. 'long chamber where the girl lies' 22. 'blue chamber' 23. dressing room 24. room for elizabeth's woman also, there would have been a kitchen, pantries, larders, store cupboards and cellars. bedrooms and closets: "a 'chamber' was a bedroom if there was a bed in it. it would have a 'closet' leading off it where clothes could be hung. ... each spouse had a closet (sometimes also, confusingly, called a 'cabinet'). this was *de rigeur* in a fashionable household." size, function: "i suspect that many of the rooms were not very big," picard says. "the division of rooms was not very new." -- pp 36-37 ✹ susan on 9 feb 2004 • link claire tomalin refers to pepys house in seething lane as having 10 rooms.maybe that excluded closets. maybe the different names for the rooms (e.g. "blue" or "green") is a reference to pepys insatiable appetite for home improvements. he was always having tradesmen in painting, plastering, doing carpentry etc.and his household changed rapidly as he became wealthier during the diary years, so the use rooms were put to changed. ✹ richard merne on 17 jun 2004 • link chip and language hat, "a breathless sequence that leaves you impressed by his determination and effectiveness, if not by his sensitivity." this is one of those quirks of the english language, where c. t. could have used either 'sensitivity' or 'insensitivity' with possible equal effect in the context of the sentence's preamble. ✹ terry f on 27 dec 2005 • link if you go back to 1746 to the se corner of this segment of the map, you will find the navy office east of seething lane across from st olave church, which faces north onto hart st. http://www.motco.com/map/81002/seriessearchplates… ✹ dorota on 27 apr 2008 • link "rooms in pepys’s seething lane home..." david why you didn't write pages where you found the names of room? can you do it now? ✹ dorota on 27 apr 2008 • link of course not pages but dates;) sorry :) ✹ geoff on 29 jun 2009 • link the navy office, and sam’s home are on sheet 22 of this 1658 map. seething lane runs from church no. 98 (st olave’s) down to church no. 2 (all hallows, barking). the churches, mansions and public buildings appear to be true depictions. the smaller houses, as drawn, might just be a stylised representation of built up areas in general. however, sam’s house, the smallest of the navy houses, would be situated at about the fourth or fifth house down on the right of that street. the navy office would be one of the buildings behind, backing onto tower hill. http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/newcourtpages/newcou… ✹ geoff on 29 jun 2009 • link st olave's is church no. 86 , not 98. (i read that upside down). ✹ cgs on 30 jun 2009 • link great find:thanks geoff this shows the great growth of the city between this map and the one 74. ✹ jim on 28 oct 2011 • link i found this explanation as to why it was called ‘seething lane’ on the ‘london gardens online’ site. “the word ‘seething’ may originate from a medieval word ‘sifethen’ meaning ‘full of chaff’ so-called after the nearby corn market.” http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-onl… ✹ grant hayter-menzies on 31 aug 2012 • link as a descendant of francis willoughby, it is fantastic to me to see david quidnunc's list of rooms in the house pepys took over from willoughby. willoughby's wife, margaret (locke) taylor, was the widow of wealthy merchant daniel taylor, whose inventory lists about as many rooms in their house in swan alley and everything in the rooms. margaret's late husband left her a very sumptuous bedchamber full of furniture, hangings, and whatnot. so much for being puritans! ✹ alice teasdale on 8 jul 2013 • link any idea of where tomalin sourced her information? ✹ san diego sarah on 2 sep 2017 • link david quidnunc's 5 dec 2003 list of rooms omits the house of office (and the cellar where the waste is collected), and the pepys' locked wine cellar (presumably a different cellar). ✹ san diego sarah on 19 jul 2018 • link and today my theory that the waste fell into the cellar and was collected in barrels takes a step forward. this article is about some dutch wine barrels from the 1680's that have been found well preserved, and they are finding out what these dutch merchants ate from the contents. https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-poop-t… log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number
