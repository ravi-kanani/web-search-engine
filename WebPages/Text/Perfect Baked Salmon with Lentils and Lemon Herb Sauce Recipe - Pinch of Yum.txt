that is my reading life. especially when it comes to nonfiction, memoirs, self help, and that whole boring crew. not to brag or anything but my binge reading game is actually pretty strong – think hunger games, gone girl, and other mind candy books. however, for those non-fiction books on my want-to-be-a-smart-person reading list? let’s just say the average finish time for these books should be recorded in years. years. like if this thing happens before 2020, i’m doing alright. enter my latest obsession not related to food but i do have a connection here –> audio books. you guys. i’m listening to those want-to-be-a-smart-person books on my way to the studio every day. 20 minutes there and 20 minutes home is 40 minutes which means i have basically become a reading machine. i can get through a book in about a week. what! this is amazing. currently reading: the body book by cameron diaz. i’m not even exaggerating when i say that the inspiration for this super simple, super healthy, perfect baked salmon one-pot meal was literally just listening to cameron diaz talk to me about the health benefits of lentils on my way to work. i parked the car at the grocery store, walked up into whole foods (god bless whole foods – i’m a new-ish grocery shopper there now that we’re located close to one and it is absolutely everything i stereotyped it to be and more), and bee-lined for the salmon and lentils. all that to say – this delicious meal brought to you by an audio book! also i’m 75 at heart. perfect baked salmon + lentils + quinoa all cooked together in one big pan? this recipe is a little outside my normal food brain space, but, besides a few takeout sushi runs (#hadto), it’s been my sole sustaining food for the last two weeks. here’s why it’s perfect. it’s a meal all in one pan. perfect baked salmon, yes. but also lentils, rice, quinoa, vegetables, whatever you want, really, all up in the same pan with the salmon. it’s very one-and-done in terms of preparation. one dish to wash. hello. one. dish. sauce or seasoning? very changeable depending on what strikes your fancy in the moment. but you’re probably having an epically long moment with lemon herb sauces too, right? it requires zero hands-on time. we’re not sautéing or whisking or even really chopping anything here. just poppin in the oven and that’s it. i would consider this a minimalist approach to dinner because, in very basic terms, you put everything in a pan and bake it. no extra steps. no extra dishes to wash. and now you’re done, and you’ve got perfectly baked salmon with tons of flavor and a pan full of other nutritious deliciousness and all of it together makes a mish-mash rainbow meal that you will want to keep eating again and again. if we can break the rules for a second here, you might even find yourself wanting to eat this for breakfast the next morning. maybe adding an egg in the spirit of creating something between this and a healing bowl. er, wait, i don’t know. did we cross a line there? just… start with dinner, okay? start with dinner. perfect baked salmon 101: if you want to go the black lentils route (do it! do it! do it!) you can order them online here. i am having a weird obsession with sauerkraut right now, especially purple sauerkraut. my current fave is a brand called spirit creek farm and i bought it at whole foods, but you can also grab it online (here) because this is a strangely wonderful world. here’s the body book which inspired this recipe. perfect baked salmon with lentils and lemon herb sauce ★★★★★ 4.9 from 21 reviews author: pinch of yum prep time: 15 mins cook time: 1 hour total time: 1 hour 15 minutes yield: 6 1x print recipe pin recipe description perfect baked salmon with lentils, quinoa, and lemon herb sauce – super healthy, high protein, bakes all in one big easy dish. this stuff is so delicious! scale 1x2x3x ingredients 1 cup black lentils 1 cup red quinoa 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth 12 ounces salmon 2–3 cups green beans or other vegetables purple sauerkraut if you’re into the weird food zone like i am lemon herb sauce: 1/2 cup olive oil 1/4 cup lemon juice 1 clove garlic generous pinch of salt (to taste) quick squeeze of honey or agave (to taste) chopped parsley (optional) instructions lentils and quinoa: preheat the oven to 450 degrees. rinse the lentils and the quinoa. place in a large oven safe skillet or casserole with the broth. bake for 45-50 minutes or until almost fully cooked. remove and fluff with a fork. sauce: make the lemon dressing by blending all ingredients in a food processor or just shaking up in a jar. set about half of the dressing aside. salmon: when the lentils and quinoa are done, place the salmon and any other vegetables you want on top of the lentils (skin side down) and drizzle or brush with half of the lemon dressing. bake for another 10 minutes. broil for the last 2 minutes. depending on how thick the salmon is, if it still needs time, just turn off the oven and let it sit in there for a few minutes to finish. serve: when the salmon is fully cooked, serve with reserved sauce and purple sauerkraut if you like that kind of crazy. notes some vegetables will cook just fine in 10 minutes in a hot oven, but others won’t. if you’re using something that’s going to require more time like sweet potatoes, i would suggest par-boiling them before sending them to the oven. veggies that work great – green beans, asparagus, kale, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, mushrooms, peas… etc. i’m okay with less, but you may want more salmon per serving – for a full 3 ounces per serving, go for a total of 15-20 ounces vs. 12 ounces as written. did you make this recipe?

( i think you meant “minutes” instead of “ounces” in your last line. ) 05/09/16 @ 9:27 am reply cherie trippy brand new subscriber and wow! this is the first thing i am making. the entire dish is reminiscent to a newish ‘fast food healthy’ restaurant in our little town of kalamazoo called ‘core life’. they create ‘bowls’ of ingredients the consumer chooses, i.e. red rice, purple rice, tofu, chicken, beef, lentils, and yes your red sauerkraut! then it can be topped with the ‘dressing’ of your choice or a warm and satisfying bone broth they make daily, either beef or chicken and now veggie. when the sauce called for parsley i had run out, but had arugula at hand and opted to toss it in! also, i added a t of toasted sesame oil with the olive oil…the possibilities are endless, also added a few slices of avocado to top it all off…so excited to explore your blog and great job on an awesome and professional site, lindsay! i could also use some of our fresh hen eggs, poached and topped on the delicious bowl of goodness! tres bon! ★★★★★ 03/12/18 @ 3:18 pm reply lauren that looks amazing! the lemon herb sauce sound phenomenal! thanks for sharing this recipe can’t wait to try it out! -lauren http://www.darlingindenim.com 05/09/16 @ 9:50 am reply ellie | hungry by nature this looks like heaven in a dish… one dish! 05/09/16 @ 10:35 am reply kari i’ve totally been wanting to read that book. it’s good to know that it inspired such a healthy meal! kari http://www.sweetteasweetie.com 05/09/16 @ 10:44 am reply molly @ spices in my dna this looks amazing! i have been on a lentil kick lately and salmon is my favorite fish. love that it’s made in one pan too..making for dinner this week! 05/09/16 @ 11:12 am reply maureen @raising the capable student i will definitely try this. i never seem to be able to make perfect baked salmon! 05/09/16 @ 11:23 am reply sally looks wonderful – but i have a question. in the write-up prior to the recipe itself, you mentioned it contained rice. i don’t see rice in the list of ingredients. should it be there? and if so, how much? thanks! 05/09/16 @ 11:37 am reply teri hi sally – i believe lindsey was saying you could use rice instead of quinoa; and vegetables other than green beans, etc. 1 cup of dry quinoa will yield about 2 cups of cooked quinoa. if you are using instant rice (probably best in this recipe), 1/2 cup of dry will give you 2 cups of cooked. if you are using long grain rice or wild rice, i believe the conversion is 1 to 3, i.e., 1 cup of dry rice yields 3 cups of cooked. i hope that helps. delicious recipe! love that lemon! 02/21/18 @ 1:49 pm reply chrissy hello! should the lentils be cooked at all before you start? mine are dry, so i’m just wondering if i should soak and boil prior. can’t wait to try this recipe! 04/29/18 @ 8:07 pm reply kathy lentils do not have to be pre-cooked. simply add lentils and quinoa to pan and add chicken stock. they cook in the same time it takes to cook the quinoa. this is a great dish, have had it twice and it is super easy and delicious. enjoy! 05/03/18 @ 11:40 am reply sara hi lindsey, i think you would like the book “skinny bitch.” it’s not as harsh as it sounds and it mostly discusses the vegan lifestyle. i thought it was a very entertaining read. 🙂 -sara https://www.amazon.com/skinny-bitch/dp/b000vceyf4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=utf8&qid=1462814198&sr=1-1&keywords=skinny+bitch&refinements=p_n_feature_browse-bin%3a1240885011 05/09/16 @ 12:18 pm reply letty ? letty' kitchen i totally hear you on books in the car. it’s the only way i can read those educational/self-help books. i listened to the omnivore’s dilemma by michael pollan. it would have taken me more than a year to finish the book otherwise! 05/09/16 @ 12:45 pm reply margot c that dish is a thing of beauty. ★★★★★ 05/09/16 @ 12:52 pm reply rebecca @ strength and sunshine ah the sauce! that is one more than perfect dinner <3 05/09/16 @ 1:50 pm reply cassie you never fail to take the most beautiful photos, lindsay! i’ve never actually tried the combo but i think it’s an incredible idea! 05/09/16 @ 2:23 pm reply lindsay thank you cassie! 😀 appreciate that. 05/11/16 @ 10:34 am reply amy fulwood wow this looks delicious. especially that sauce! 05/09/16 @ 2:42 pm reply lindsay i’m obsessed. thanks for the comment amy! 05/11/16 @ 10:34 am reply emily @ robust recipes omg this is the food of my dreams! love salmon, love lentils, love quinoa. plus anything with lemon and herbs makes everything better! 🙂 05/09/16 @ 2:49 pm reply lindsay thanks emily! 🙂 05/11/16 @ 10:34 am reply ellen @ my uncommon everyday i love audible! i loved listening to the girl on the train for a more intense/gripping story, and i also love rhys bowen books for (very) light, funny listens. if you haven’t read it, big little lies was really well-done as an audiobook. and a decade-too-late plug for the harry potter books read by jim dale because jim dale is excellent. i could go on for ages. audiobooks are great. 05/09/16 @ 3:36 pm reply lindsay ahhh i haven’t read big little lies or harry potter! i’ve got some good reading coming up. 05/11/16 @ 10:34 am reply michelle anderson this looks mouthwatering delicious. can’t wait to try. 05/09/16 @ 3:56 pm reply lindsay thanks michelle! 05/11/16 @ 10:33 am reply kathie going into the oven soon…. should the skillet/casserole be covered in the lentils and quinoa step? assuming so….. 05/09/16 @ 4:10 pm reply lindsay i didn’t cover mine! 05/11/16 @ 10:33 am reply angela what can be used instead of black lentils? can other kinds of lentils be used? 05/09/16 @ 4:42 pm reply lindsay sure! black lentils are a little smaller and cook a bit faster, but regular lentils could be used as long as you leave enough time for them to cook! might take a little longer. 05/11/16 @ 10:32 am reply roxana i’ll start with dinner, but the breakfast idea sounds pretty good too! 😉 05/09/16 @ 5:41 pm reply lindsay dinner is a good place to start. 🙂 05/11/16 @ 10:30 am reply lindsay made this for dinner tonight and it was ah-maz-ing! i love salmon and it was great to try a new way of making it. love the lemon herb sauce and quinoa as well ★★★★ 05/09/16 @ 5:51 pm reply lindsay so glad to hear that lindsay! power to the salmon! 05/11/16 @ 10:29 am reply melissa @ bits of umami if lentils are good enough for c. diaz – then they are absolutely good enough for me. doubt the ones she’s eating are looking this delicious though! lemon herb sauce has me drooling. 05/09/16 @ 5:59 pm reply lindsay hahah right?! thanks cam! 05/11/16 @ 10:29 am reply mb @ bourbon and brown sugar oh my word… this is the perfect intersection of healthy and delicious, lindsay… love it! 05/09/16 @ 7:01 pm reply lindsay thank you mb! appreciate that! 05/11/16 @ 10:29 am reply karly i recommend pretty much everything by carl hiaasen, especially if you enjoy thriller/mysteries that are also unbelievably hilarious. skinny dip is a perfect book to start with! 05/09/16 @ 7:04 pm reply lindsay i do love thrillers! 😀 thanks for the rec karly! 05/11/16 @ 10:28 am reply sylvia this looks delicious! lentils are one of my favorite foods. 🙂 05/09/16 @ 8:41 pm reply lindsay same here sylvia! 05/11/16 @ 10:28 am reply newer comments » hey! nice to meet you! i'm lindsay: former 4th grade teacher, now full time blogger. my husband bjork and i live in minnesota. favorite things include my camera, lake days, and dark chocolate. learn more. popular posts dessert the best soft chocolate chip cookies dinner baked mozzarella chicken rolls recipes slow cooker chicken pot pie soup quick and easy date night mushroom fettuccine blogging tips delivered straight to your inbox blogger resources top posts 1 avoiding blog burnout2 blogging as a couple3 building a blog while traveling4 how to start a food blog5 creating an income6 tools bloggers shouldn't live without7 photography tips start, grow, and monetize your food blog. join today. how’s this for awesome?
