hecklerspray grown up gossip & internet villainy pete davidson and kate beckinsale are a legit thing march 4th, 2019 by krysta fitzpatrick while ariana grande is maybe fucking big sean again, pete davidson continues his ascension to legend status by locking down babe of all babes, kate beckinsale. it’s one thing to be seen flirting at a golden globes after-party or leaving a club at all hours hand-in-hand, it’s a whole other thing to be spotted laying on the pda at a hockey game, which pete and kate were. pete and kate recently attended a new york rangers hockey game together and couldn’t keep their hands or lips off of each other, and pete looked really fucking happy (i mean, how could he not?) which warmed my cold little heart. what’s more, is that kate attended the saturday night live after party with pete this past weekend, which essentially solidifies her as his girlfriend. when i found out that kate beckinsale and pete davidson were maybe hooking up, i was super happy for him because i really felt like he needed this win. now that he seems to be full on dating kate beckinsale i feel like giving pete davidson a fucking slow clap. what a fucking year this kid is having! being funny, awkward, and mentally ill is really paying off for him! comments enzo mazzini says march 19, 2019 at 2:29 pm nice couple… congratulations no pete says april 29, 2019 at 4:59 pm davidson is disgustingly ugly compared to super babe, kate beckinsale. joey says june 22, 2019 at 12:03 pm fucking gross leave a comment cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * notify me of new posts by email. a mediocre rundown of the 2019 oscars so the jodyn and tristan thing is probably true tristan thompson allegedly cheats on khloe kardashian with jordyn woods lil xan is having a kid and i can't deal with that katy perry and orlando bloom are engaged blogroll rumorfix hecklerspray.com copyright © 2019 · · terms · privacy · dmca · contact
