a similar series for althorp; a series of 12 of the admirals and captains who fought in the second anglo-dutch war, known as the "flagmen of lowestoft", now mostly owned by the national maritime museum in greenwich; and his susannah and the elders at burghley house. james vii and ii, duke of york, 1661 his most famous non-portrait work is probably nymphs by a fountain in dulwich picture gallery. lely played a significant role in introducing the mezzotint to britain, as he realized its possibilities for publicising his portraits. he encouraged dutch mezzotinters to come to britain to copy his work, laying the foundations for the english mezzotint tradition. lely lived from about 1651 to 1680 at no. 10-11 great piazza, covent garden. he was knighted in 1679.[7] lely died soon afterwards at his easel in covent garden, while painting a portrait of the duchess of somerset. sir peter was buried at st paul's church, covent garden. legacy in his lifetime, lely was known as a skillful connoisseur of art.[8] his collection of old masters, including veronese, titian, claude lorrain and rubens, and a fabulous collection of drawings, was broken up and sold after his death, raising the immense sum of £26,000.[9] some items in it which had been acquired by lely from the commonwealth dispersal of charles i's art collections, such as the lely venus, were re-acquired by the royal collection. he was replaced as court portraitist by sir godfrey kneller, also a german-born dutchman, whose style drew from lely's but reflecting later continental trends. between them they established the basic english portrait style followed by less fashionable painters for decades. amongst lely's pupils were john greenhill and willem wissing. a horse was also named after him, finishing fourth in the 1996 grand national. gallery peter lely's works earl and countess of oxford sir robert worsley, 3rd baronet lady mary fane by sir peter lely queen mary ii portrait of a man, thought to be george booth, lord delamere, 1660 portrait of lady elizabeth strickland, née pile catherine of braganza, queen of england 1665 portrait of a lady with a blue drape, circa 1660 abraham cowley, c. 1665–66 two ladies from the lake family, 1650. diana kirke, later countess of oxford, 1665 a boy as a shep charles ii of england, c. 1675 jane howard, duchess of norfolk dudley, daughter of sr. henry north, bart., wife of sir thomas cullum sir thomas fanshawe of jenkins and his wife margaret madonna and child by sir peter lely sir william ashburnham lady frances savile, later lady brudenell portrait of margaret hughes c. 1670. portrait of charlotte lee, countess of lichfield 1674 notes this article includes a list of references, but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations. please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations.

'whether the age was improved by beauty or in flattery, lely's women are certainly mre handsomer than those of vandyke. they please as much more as they evidently meaned to please." the commentary goes on to note the "sameness" of all of the women that lely painted in their sleepy eyes and some facial expressions. ✹ cgs on 26 nov 2009 • link one of his rivals was a little known painter, a female that mrs pepys should have used. mary beale. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mary_beale ✹ bill on 9 jan 2014 • link sir peter lely, who painted history and landscape when he first came into england, applied himself afterwards to portrait, in emulation of vandyck. he copied the works of that admirable master with great success; but could not arrive at his excellence in copying nature. vandyck painted what he saw before him; lely painted his own ideas. in vandyck's pictures we instantly see the person represented; in lely's we see the painter. the languishing air, the sleepy eye, the cast of draperies, shew him to have been an excessive mannerist: but they shew him, at the fame time, to have been an excellent artist. the ladies were desirous of being drawn by his hand, as he knew how to bestow beauty where nature had been sparing. it has been justly said of him, that "he painted many fine pictures, but few good portraits." ob. 30 november, 1680, æt 63. he left an estate of 900 l. per annum, and his judicious collection of paintings, prints, and drawings sold for 26,000 l. ---a biographical history of england. j. granger, 1775. ✹ bill on 10 aug 2015 • link peter lely, who was knighted by charles ii. he lived for a time in drury lane, but in 1662 he moved to a house in the piazza, covent garden. he died of apoplexy, 1680, and left an estate in lincolnshire of £800 a year. his collection of pictures and drawings was very fine, and realized £26,000 when sold by auction. ---wheatley, 1899. ✹ bill on 10 aug 2015 • link lely, sir peter (1618-1680), portrait-painter; born at soest by amersfoort, near utrecht; studied at haarlem; came to england, 1641; introduced to charles i, 1647; painted charles i's portrait during his captivity at hampton court; painted cromwell and enjoyed considerable private practice under him; in high favour with charles ii; painted portraits of the beauties of charles ii's court, and of the admirals and commanders in the naval victory at solebay, 1665; knighted, 1679. ---dictionary of national biography: index and epitome. s. lee, 1906. log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 oct 22 1662 jun 18 oct 20 1664 mar 29 aug 26 1665 jul 23 1666 mar 24 apr 18 jul 18 nov 7 1667 mar 25 1668 aug 21 1618-1680. a painter of dutch origin. he was the most popular portrait artist in england from soon after he arrived in the country in the 1640s to his death. he also owned a major collection of art, especially drawings by other artists. latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
