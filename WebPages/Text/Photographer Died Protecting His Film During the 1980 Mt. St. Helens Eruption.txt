[#] the photos were published in the january 1981 issue of national geographic. many people might think of saving their precious photos in the event of a house fire, but how many photographers would think to use their bodies to protect their photographs? robert landsberg (via reddit) tags: death, died, eruption, inspiration, inspiring, mountsthelenes, mtsthelens, preserve, protect, robertlandsberg, volcano share tweet 24 please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus. prev cameras sculpted using found paper next this photo may have been taken with the upcoming iphone 5 trending posts photos of the robots living among us mar 25, 2020 adobe is giving everyone 2 months of free creative cloud — here’s how to get it mar 18, 2020 sony spins off camera business into separate company 16 hours ago a boston event photographer shares her story of contracting covid-19 mar 24, 2020 nat geo: those viral animal photos you’ve been seeing on twitter are fake mar 24, 2020 21 portrait photography lessons from 21 great photographers mar 25, 2020 the library of fake ‘travel photos’ in asia mar 24, 2020 ilford: stockpile rolls of film, not toilet paper mar 25, 2020 drone photos of singapore shot at 1,640 feet mar 23, 2020 polaroid originals reclaims ‘polaroid’ name, unveils polaroid now camera 20 hours ago nikon z vs nikon d: a comparison mar 24, 2020 70 inspirational quotes for photographers may 29, 2014 the supreme court just decided that states cannot be sued for copyright infringement mar 23, 2020 how to turn your bedroom into a giant camera and use it to make pictures mar 24, 2020 the late kenny rogers was a fantastic photographer mar 23, 2020 you can use any lamp in your house as a tripod mar 25, 2020 portraits in the time of coronavirus: shooting free front porch photo sessions mar 25, 2020 this obstacle avoiding drone is so fast it can play dodgeball mar 25, 2020 these are the finalists of nikon’s surf photo of the year 2020 mar 23, 2020 nisi unveils tiny filter system for the fujifilm x100v mar 25, 2020 archives news gear inspiration tutorials reviews archives podcast copyright © 2020 petapixel subscribe our newsletter to stay up to date 500 k 1 m
