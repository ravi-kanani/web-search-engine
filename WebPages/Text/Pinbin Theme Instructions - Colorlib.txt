pinbin theme uses wordpress featured images. so if no featured images are set it won’t show anything. if you have lot of posts and you don’t want to set featured images for each post manually you can use plugin called auto post thumbnail. we already tried to implement this feature in theme but wordpress.org theme reviewers refused to accept it. 5.2 what is recommended image size for this theme? featured image width is set to 750px. you can use larger images as well but smaller images won’t look as good. 5.3 why posts are not aligned horizontally? this theme uses masonry javascript grid layout library which is inside wordpress core since wordpress 3.5. which means that you must have wordpress 3.5 or later version installed. you can update your wordpress installation via admin dashboard. for other support related questions please see our support forum. disclosure: this page contains external affiliate links that may result in us receiving a commission if you choose to purchase mentioned product. the opinions on this page are our own and we don't receive additional bonus for positive reviews. follow us facebook instagram linkedin twitter youtube colorlib themes all free themes activello theme illdy theme shapely sparkling theme dazzling theme travelify wordpress theme unite wordpress theme pinbin wordpress theme support forum we recommend: categories coupons ecommerce frameworks free themes giveaway hosting inspiration logo design mockups news photography plugins portfolio promotions psd templates reviews snippets theme collections tools tutorial uncategorized website builders website design website templates metro colors color mixer we change everything wordpress. one wordpress theme at a time. find out more! our themes all free themes activello theme illdy theme shapely sparkling theme dazzling theme travelify wordpress theme unite wordpress theme pinbin wordpress theme support forum useful about colorlib advertise wordpress themes website templates bootstrap templates our contributors support forum – support policy contact us we are hiring! log in username: password: keep me signed in log in register lost password copyright 2013-2020 colorlib - all rights reserved. privacy policy | site terms & disclosures. hosted by kinsta about colorlib advertise wordpress themes website templates bootstrap templates our contributors support forum – support policy contact us we are hiring! back to top ×
