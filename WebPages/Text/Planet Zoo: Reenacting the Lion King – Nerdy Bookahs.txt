my previous empty ex-warthog exhibit had gotten merged with the hyena one. the tooltip had said “empty exhibit”. empty being the keyword here. however, at some point during the mess in the staircase, a warthog had gotten transported back into the exhibit. since the zoo keepers had gotten stuck, the hyenas had been starving (i’d received warning messages about that as well) and then this cute little warthog arrived just in time for lunch. i think i could have gotten it out of there by transferring it to the trade center, but then i would have had to sell it. so either way, the warthog would have been lost. let me tell you, the warthog squeaks when it gets attacked. it wasn’t a pleasant moment, to be honest. with all of that having happened, i restarted the mission and the very first thing i did was removing the paths to the the staircase! but that’s a gaming evening lost… (intpipomo count: 52 in total) share this: click to share on twitter (opens in new window) click to share on facebook (opens in new window) click to email this to a friend (opens in new window) click to share on whatsapp (opens in new window) click to share on pocket (opens in new window) more click to share on telegram (opens in new window) click to share on linkedin (opens in new window) click to print (opens in new window) click to share on reddit (opens in new window) click to share on pinterest (opens in new window) click to share on skype (opens in new window) click to share on tumblr (opens in new window) like this: like loading... related categories: blogging months games published by paeroka view all posts by paeroka tags: bugs, intpipomo 2019, planet zoo post navigation previous screenshot saturday: whisper in the dark next screenshot saturday: new dervish 1 comment pingback: my top games 2019 – nerdy bookahs what do you think?
