formats[edit] the impossible project has stated that they will not manufacture packfilm "in the foreseeable future", due to the investment required,[64][65] and cannot produce 4x5, type 100, or type 80 films, polaroid 500 film and i-zone film as they do not have the production machinery. these were disassembled along with the factories that used to produce the film when polaroid filed for chapter 11.[66] impossible founder florian kaps left the company in july 2013 and later founded a coffee house and photo studio in vienna called supersense.[67] kaps revealed through a series of blog posts and interviews in 2016 that he had personally approached fuji about acquiring their machinery in an attempt to rescue their soon-to-be discontinued fp3000b and fp100b packfilm products.[68][69][70] kaps was unsuccessful in this pursuit, but motivated by his disappointment in fuji's decision, he established the analogue product institute (api) with the goal of "developing a new generation of analog instant packfilm [and] establishing a rich network of new suppliers, manufacturers and financiers from all over the world".[71] hardware[edit] polaroid originals produces its own hardware as well as refurbish polaroid corporation cameras.[72] instant lab[edit] the instant lab is a device that exposes digital images from a smartphone onto analog instant film, using the light produced by the screen. the first generation of the instant lab was introduced in october 2013. it supports the iphone 4, 4s, 5, 5c and 5s, as well as the ipod touch. the device was produced after a successful crowd-funding campaign on kickstarter.[73] impossible project introduced a new battery-less film cartridge design for use with the instant lab. the system, now known as the i-type system, is a polaroid 600-type cartridge stripped of the battery. the instant lab is internally-powered and does not rely on the battery to work. it works with all polaroid square film formats, that is the original 600, the battery-less i-type, and the less sensitive sx-70.[74] a "universal cradle" is later released for instant lab 1.0 to accommodate different screen sizes on the iphone 6 and various android phones.[75][76] it turns the device into the newer instant lab universal (2015), a new generation announced at photokina 2014.[77][78] instant cameras[edit] impossible i-1[edit] in 2016, impossible started manufacturing its own instant camera, the impossible i-1. it is a part of the company's original i-type system, which uses its new i-type film and 600 film.[79][80] it features bluetooth connectivity for remote control, double-exposure, advanced manual settings, among other features.[81] it was designed by teenage engineering.[82] polaroid onestep 2[edit] in september 2017, polaroid originals announced the polaroid onestep 2 instant film camera that uses its i-type film and 600 film.[1][2][3] in the first version of this camera, framing is done by looking through a window on the back of the camera. later in 2018, the company released a version with a built-in viewfinder that makes framing more accurate, the onestep 2 viewfinder. polaroid onestep+[edit] in september 2018, polaroid originals introduced the polaroid onestep+ instant film camera that uses i-type film and 600 film.[83] the onestep+ has built-in bluetooth wireless technology that allows the camera to be paired with the polaroid originals app on an ios or android smartphone or tablet. this enables six new features: remote trigger, double exposure, light painting, self timer (with up to a 12 s countdown), manual mode (controlling aperture, shutter speed, flash intensity and photos ejection) and noise trigger.[84] the onestep+ has an additional portrait lens, with minimum focusing distance of 30 cm. a slide toggle on the top of the camera switches between the two lenses. the camera also includes a higher-capacity battery (recharged through a microusb adapter), a built-in flash, and a viewfinder. media[edit] the complexity of developing new generations of (prototype) instant film was depicted in the 2017 documentary instant dreams. parts of the documentary where shot on location at polaroid originals labs and production facilities in the netherlands and germany and include chief technical officer stephen herchen. references[edit] ^ a b c "polaroid lives again with
