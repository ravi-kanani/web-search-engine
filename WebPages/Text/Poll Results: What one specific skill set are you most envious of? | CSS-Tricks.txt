(the original poll said "jealous", but the proper term is "envious" for what i meant. thanks tristan!) here are the results: see the pen highcharts barchart by chris coyier (@chriscoyier) on codepen. the winner, with 26% of the vote: visual / interaction design. the biggest slice of voters wished they were better at this type of design. i feel you, that's what i voted for too. i am the visual designer for several projects and i wish i could do them better justice. for years i've been wanting to level up in that, but it always ends up that my time is divided up such that i haven't been able to give it the hours it needs. visual design is such a vital component to the success of things, it's no wonder we're envious of it around here on a site dedicated to other areas. the runner up, with 24% of the vote is similarly no surprise: back end development. i guess if we're a bunch of front end developers around here, we're most jealous of the the two other main components that make a website. third place was actually front end development with 16%, which i bet accounts for folks googling things, landing on css-tricks, and voting based on wishing they already knew what they were googling =). server management was at 7%. database administration was at 4%. so 11% of folks wish they were better at that low-level stuff that keeps websites running. i probably would have picked one of these as my runner up. 6% of people voted for video / audio production. perhaps i should have lumped photography in there too. the idea was complimentary artistic skills to web design, as they as used and very important to lots of websites. writing / copywriting had 5%. i bet this would have been an interesting one to break down by years-in-industry as, just anecdotally, the more i hear people wishing for greater skill in this area the longer they are around. it's almost certainly the strongest form of marketing (also 5%). if you've heard of something/someone, it's because writing. bringing up the rear was management at 4%. this is something i've always wanted the opportunity to do, but haven't yet had the chance. i suspect i'll love it one day, but i'm not yet envious of management skill, as i haven't started that journey. and last place: knowing / practicing the law at 3%. any final words on your skill envy? new poll tomorrow. our learning partner need some front-end development training? frontend masters is the best place to get it. they have courses on all the most important front-end technologies, from react to css, from vue to d3, and beyond with node.js and full stack. need some front-end development training?

tyme permalink to comment# november 27, 2014 well, for any of you that answered ‚Äúwriting‚Äù, i‚Äôd be happy to take your work load there! i am also a frontend developer / designer, but i do love to write (and edit)! i‚Äôll ghost write all those blog posts that your company requires you to write on the regular‚Ä¶you know the ones still awaiting your attention. this comment thread is closed. if you have important information to share, please contact us. related how do you stay up to date in this fast‚Å†-‚Å†moving industry?
