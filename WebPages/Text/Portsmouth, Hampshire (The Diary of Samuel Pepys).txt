there was another outbreak of plague. but under charles i (1625-49) portsmouth began to regain some of its former importance. in 1628 one of the kings advisors, the duke of buckingham was assassinated in the town. he was stabbed to death by a sailor john fenton in a house in high street. fenton was hanged for the crime and his body was hanged in chains on land east of the town until it decomposed as a warning to others. then in 1642 came civil war between king and parliament. most of the people in portsmouth, including the mayor supported parliament. but the military governor of the town, colonel goring supported the king and he commanded the soldiers in the town. the navy sided with parliament and portsmouth was blockaded by sea. parliament sent men to besiege portsmouth by land. southsea castle was taken after only token resistance. the guns of southsea castle were then used to fire at the town of portsmouth. on the other side of portsmouth the town of gosport joined the parliamentary side. here too, guns were set up and were fired at portsmouth. besieged by land and sea and with no support in the town goring realized the situation was hopeless. he decided to surrender but he obtained good terms. he threatened to explode a gunpowder magazine and wreck the town unless he was allowed to escape unharmed. he was duly allowed to escape with his few supporters. following the end of the civil war in 1646 portsmouth prospered. in 1650 a ship called the portsmouth was launched in the dockyard. it was the first ship to be built in the town for over 100 years. between 1650 and 1660 12 ships were built in portsmouth and the town was very busy. its population had probably grown to over 3,000. in the late 17th century the dockyard (and the town) continued to grow. in 1663 a new wharf was built for the exclusive use of the navy and the dockyard. in 1665 a mast pond was dug (masts were soaked in it for years to season them). as the dockyard lay north of the town surrounded by fields it was easy for it to expand. then in 1667-85 the fortifications around portsmouth were rebuilt. new walls were built with many bastions (triangular towers). two moats were dug outside the walls separated by a strip of land. afterwards portsmouth was one of the most heavily fortified towns in europe. http://www.localhistories.org/portsmouth.html ✹ cumgranissalis on 22
