technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. you can reset your browser to reject all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. but

policy located at https://www.entrepreneur.com/cookie-policy. we do not track our users across third party websites and thus do not respond to do not track ("dnt") signals. however, some third party websites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. if you are visiting such sites, certain website browsers allow you to set the dnt signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. 3. the advertising on our service. advertising on our service makes it possible for us to offer you the information and products/services free of charge. we take seriously and make every effort to make sure that advertising is safe, unobtrusive and as relevant as possible. cookies are used to make that advertising as relevant as possible to the needs and interests of users of our service, and more valuable to our advertisers in being able to show our visitors more relevant ads. cookies are also used to avoid you seeing the same ad multiple times and to detect and prevent click fraud. we use adsense, google analytics and other doubleclick services (collectively, "google¬Æ services"), which help us manage and improve our service and help our advertisers better understand and track user interaction with their ads. when you visit a location on our service that includes one or more of these ads, various cookies may be sent to your browser. we may use other technologies, including flash and html5, which provide the functionality for such displays as interactive advertising. we may also use your ip address to select and provide advertising targeted to that address, in order to improve the relevance of the ads you see and to measure and report to advertisers non-personal statistical information about geographical location of those website visitors who are viewing their ads. the advertising you see on our service is determined by a number of factors relating to relevance, including (i) your approximate geographical location base on you ip address and (ii) the subject matter you may be viewing on our service. for example, if you are viewing an article about physical health, you may see ads concerning exercise equipment. if you wish to know more about the information collected from website users and used to tailor those advertisements for products and services which might be of the most interest and relevance to those users, or would like to know more about the user‚Äôs options in connection with the collection and use of that information, you can visit the network advertising initiative ("nai") website at http://www.networkadvertising.org. the nai is a cooperative of online advertising companies who are committed to responsible practices and consumer protection. 4. privacy and choice. people have different concerns about privacy. our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how that information is used. you may set your browser in its "options" or "preferences" feature in order to warn you before accepting cookies or to disable all cookies entirely. however, it is important to understand that many of the services we provide on our service and to our service users may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. 5. minors and children under the age of 16. emi does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to register to use our service. no one under age 16 is allowed to provide any personal information to emi or on our service. in the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. if you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under age 16, please contact us at legal@entrepreneur.com. 6. where we store the

processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. by submitting your information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. 7. the information you share. our service allows visitors to share information with others, such as comments on editorial content and information shared via social media. when you share information it may as a result become accessible to others, through such mechanisms as search engines. we cannot be responsible for how others with whom you may share information may use that information.
