(more…) no comments. 24 august, 2019 are there reasons not to have rp in mmos? filed under: game design game development — psychochild @ 11:47 pm to end the week, i wanted to think a bit about a contrary opinion. i’ve spent all week talking about rp from a development point of view and how to facilitate and support it in the game, particularly in ways that don’t disturb other parts of the game. but are there reasons not to have rp in the game? i’m not sure where this post will go, but let’s consider this a bit as i write. (more…) comments (3) 23 august, 2019 writing better lore for rp. filed under: game design game development — psychochild @ 11:51 pm yesterday i looked at how to design for rp, how a few changes might bring about better rp in a game while not affecting the rest of the server much. today, i want to look more at lore, and how you can write that to facilitate rp in the game. again, i’ll look at ffxiv as an example to draw from. (more…) no comments. 22 august, 2019 designing for better rp filed under: game design game development — psychochild @ 11:55 pm in addition to better tools, there are some design considerations in an mmo that can be made to help facilitate rp. these design decisions can seem pretty small, but they can have a pretty big impact on how people interact with the game. with these considerations, rp could be enhanced in a game, even if rp isn’t the focus of the game. let’s take a look at a few ideas to improve rp, shall we?
