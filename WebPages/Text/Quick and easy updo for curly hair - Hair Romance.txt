i filmed the ending and grabbed another bobby pin to fix it as we were running out the door. i really like this rolled look, it creates a kind of bagel-shaped bun. if you‚Äôve got longer or shorter hair, you can just twist it around into a regular bun or whatever works for you. add an accessory hair pins are so on trend right now and i do love these clips for adding a little bit of detail, particularly as my hair is so bright at the moment. i think they add a little more intention and a bit of chicness to the style. if someone tries to tell you a messy bun isn‚Äôt work-appropriate just put a pretty clip in it and they‚Äôll never comment. i‚Äôm loving the range at asos at the moment. i hope you like this tutorial and that you give it a go in your hair. as always i love to see photos of your hair and you can ask me any questions over on instagram @hairromance and use #hairromance so that i can see your photos as well. let me know in the comments what you‚Äôd like to see next and if you have any tutorial requests. you may also like... no related posts. filed under: curly hair, curly hairstyles, fast hairstyles, hair romance, hair romance tv, tutorials ¬´ how do you get bobby pins to stay in your hair?
