music, poland, sabaton — nicholas @ 06:00 sabaton history published 26 mar 2020 “aces in exile” return! interesting times make for interesting men. in this second part we talk about some individual stories of czechoslovakian, polish and canadian pilots that all fought under the banner of the british royal air force during the second world war. how they escaped german occupation, how they traveled through war torn europe, and how they eventually found themselves fighting in a different uniform for a different country. we would like to thank the world of tanks team for their

government, health, media, usa — tags: epidemic, publichealth, socialmedia, statistics, tv, wuhancoronavirus — nicholas @ 05:00 the all-hysteria, all the time media will have much to regret once the worst of the wuhan coronavirus epidemic has run its course: the data we have sucks, and thus any conclusions we are drawing mostly suck too. the data is worse than just being incomplete or bad — if it was randomly distributed, we could live with that. but the lack of test kits and how we have deployed the few we have means that the data is severely biased. we are only testing people who are strongly symptomatic. if there is a normal distribution of outcomes from this disease, we are only testing on the right side of the distribution. we have no idea where the median is or how long the tail is to the left side of asymptomatic outcomes. the only thing we absolutely know about the disease is its not as deadly as the media is portraying as we are missing hundreds of thousands of cases in the denominator of the mortality rates. the media has also been terrible about reporting on risk factors of those who died. when a bunch of people died suddenly in seattle, one had to read down 5 paragraphs into the story to find that they were all over 70 in an old-age home. or when prime-of-life people die, facts such as their being type 1 diabetics — a known severe risk factor for this virus (and one that makes it different from the flu) are left out. the media is constantly confusing changes in measurement technique and intensity with changes in the underlying progress of the virus itself. changes in case numbers have as much to do with testing patterns and availability than they do with the real spread of the disease. while covid-19 is likely worse than the normal flu, our perceptions of how much worse are strongly affected by observer bias. frankly, if every news broadcast every night spent 15 minutes reciting flu deaths each day, we would all be hiding in our homes away from flu. they present a healthy man in his thirties dying clearly as the tragedy it is, but the spoken or unspoken subtext is, “this is abnormal so this thing is much worse.” but it seems abnormal because we do not report on the very real stories of healthy young people who die of the flu. my nephew who was 25 years old and totally healthy with no pre-existing conditions died of the flu last month — and no one featured this tragedy on the national news. the data we are getting sucks worse because the media has decided, as one big group, that for our own good they are going to limit all facts about the virus to only the bad ones. there is a strong sense — you see it on twitter both in twitter’s policies as well as twitter group attacks — that saying anything that might in any way reduce one’s fear of the disease should be banned for our own good. one of the more prominent examples was medium removing an article not because it was proven wrong but because it took one side of a very open question and it was obviously decided it was “unsafe” to allow that side to even be aired. share this: twitter reddit email print more linkedin pinterest pocket facebook tumblr

precautionaryprinciple, publichealth, risk, wuhancoronavirus — nicholas @ 03:00 david zaruk wrote last week for science 2.0 europe: two decades of the precautionary principle as the key policy tool for managing uncertainties has neutered risk management capacities by offering, as the only approach, the systematic removal of any exposure to any hazard. as the risk-averse precautionary mindset cements itself, more and more of us have become passive docilians waiting to be nannied. we no longer trust and are no longer trusted with risk-benefit choices as we are channelled down over-engineered preventative paths. while it is important to reduce exposure to risks, our excessively-protective risk managers have, in their zeal, removed our capacity to manage risks ourselves. precaution over information, safety over autonomy, dictation over accountability. whatever happened to “keep out of reach of children”? now we cannot be trusted and all products must be child-safe. whatever happened to “handle with care”? now safety by design has removed the need for individuals to exercise common sense or risk reduction measures. whatever happened to trust? now individuals are no longer left with the capacity to make their own decisions in managing personal risks. “these are good things” precaution advocates would retort “since people often make mistakes and bad things can better be prevented!”. while continuous improvement of safety systems has its value, the bigger the fences, the less autonomously the individuals will react (creating a society of docile followers). the precautionary approach implies a lack of trust in individuals’ capacities to make their own (rational) choices. the over-engineered risk-management process would remove any situation where choices could be made. fine for cases where there are no trade-offs, disruptions or loss of benefits (when the sheep have plenty of grass in their field), but in times of crisis (exposure to hazards), when precaution is your only tool, then sacrifice is the only solution. […] when the public now sees everything of modern life (work, school, public events …) cancelled in a knee-jerk precautionary impulse, is it any wonder they are panicking? enter the opportunist to sell you the silver solution or the naturopath detox remedy to put your mind at ease. enter the quack to tell you to drink bleach. enter the racist who will use the fear to mobilise outrage. exit rationality and risk management. with no bullets left in the risk-management gun, the only thing left to do is run … or as it is more commonly called: apply the precautionary principle. precaution should only be applied after other risk management measures have failed but given how horribly inadequate our capacities to govern have become, it is the only strategy our regulators have come to know. slide from a presentation by patti gettinger, 2011-07-11. original slideshow at https://fr.slideshare.net/regsgridlock/the-precautionary-principle-8656034 h/t to johnathan pearce for the link.

guns, infantry, interwarperiod — nicholas @ 02:00 forgotten weapons published 18 nov 2019 after world war one, the british looked at how to apply the lessons of the war to development of a new infantry rifle. even before the war, a decision had been made to move to an aperture type rear sight — which would have been used on the pattern 1913 enfield, had the war no interrupted adoption of that model. so after the war, trials were made on some mkiii smle rifles refitted with rear aperture sights. these trials were successful enough to justify production of a substantial number of rifles for troop trials. this would be designated the no1 mkv rifle, and 20,000 of them were made between 1922 and 1924. the magazine cutoff was retained in the mkv rifles, as were the volley sights in the initial production — along with an aperture rear sight marked out to 1500 yards. following concerns about the durability of the sight and its adjustment latch, it was redesigned slightly, and the new version only went out to 1400 yards. on this second variation, the volley sights were omitted. the new rifles was taken to bisley and input was sought from both military units and civilian marksmen from the british nra. the feedback that was received was that the sight was too fragile, its adjustments were too coarse, and the barrel was too light. these changes were implemented in the no1 mkvi rifle which would ultimately be adopted as the n4 mki; the classic world war 2 version oft he lee enfield. http://www.patreon.com/forgottenweapons cool forgotten weapons merch!

means taking ones own property and passing it on to someone in need. nowhere did he advocate taking from others by force and “redistributing” it. he certainly did not advocate taking from others, using what’s taken to fund a huge government bureaucracy, and pass out a pittance of the remainder to the poor (have to justify that bureaucracy somehow). nowhere in the bible is there a passage similar to this: and i say unto you, take up your sword and shew it to the rich man and say unto him “give to me your wealth that it might care for the poor, lest i smite you to the earth.” and when the wealthy man has given up his wealth, take it and pay for a multitude of scribes and pharisees and learned doctors of the law and say unto them, “use this wealth to provide for your hire, but only this, save a pittance thereof and give it unto the poor so that we may noise about this good work and stand in the marketplace speaking loudly of these alms we give.” and when this is done, say unto the people “behold, we have cared for the poor. now give us more of your wealth that we may continue to do so and to do other things.” and if any dare to resist you, lay your hands upon him and chain him and cast him into a dungeon. and in all this way shall you show unto the people your mercy and kindness. when people advocate socialism enforced by government, they are advocating using force to take from some to give to others. nowhere in his teachings did christ advocate that. nowhere. this is where some people say “but christ said render unto caesar.” yes. he did. in response to a question intended to trap him. context matters. christ had rising popularity among the masses which concerned the jewish leadership greatly. so they planted the question of whether they should give tribute to caesar. if christ had simply said “yes” he would have lost his popular audience and his ministry would have died right there. if he had said “no”, he would likely have been arrested (“we caught him forbidding tribute to caesar” was one of the charges the sanhedrin laid against him when handing him over to the romans for execution). and his ministry would have died right there. instead, he asked for an example of the tribute money, asked whose picture was on it, and gave his famous answer. and if people followed him in that, the roman reprisal, destruction of jerusalem, and diaspora would have occurred before much of christ’s mission was fairly begun. if you accept his divinity, you have to accept that he knew this and gave the answer that allowed him to complete his mission. but did “render unto caesar” mean an endorsement of everything that tax funds were used for? did he endorse gladiatorial games? wars of conquest? the capture and importation of slaves? the use of government troops to put down slave revolts? let’s not be absurd. just because the roman government did something with tax monies, or modern governments do something with it, “render unto caesar” is not an endorsement of that use. government is force, pure and simple. that’s essentially a definition of government: the legitimizing of the use of force. socialism imposed by government has nothing to do with christian charity. it is, in fact, very nearly the exact opposite, wearing a mask to confuse the unwary. david l. burkhead, “the “christian left”, the writer in black, 2018-01-08. share this:

challenge so far. so much happens and at such a fast pace that it’s difficult to understand everything as it is, let alone get it into a chronological video that actually makes sense! the amount of actors both nationally and internationally gives you a feeling that you are writing about a continental, or even global, war rather than one in a relatively small country. it is this way for several reasons, a lot of which you’ll know if you watched our last episode on the second spanish republic. but we’d be interested to see what you guys think about the spanish civil war? why was it so

wuhancoronavirus — nicholas @ 03:00 david warren provides a glimpse of what life is like in the toronto neighbourhood of parkdale during the wuhan coronavirus epidemic: is gentle reader bored with pathogens yet? at some point in the proximate future, death will lose its sting. while there are plausible economic reasons for people to return to work, there is also a dark secret. the most restless society since the invention of restlessness cannot cope with “downtime.” this is what gives me my monopoly on idleness. without the “events” which help to distinguish one day from another, we will need to start a war. the parkdale neighbourhood of toronto. map by alaney2k via wikimedia commons. had we books, and to have developed the habit of using them, we might read history instead; and even a bit of poetry on the side. but now, at loose ends, we are inspired to do something. also, please note, the doctrine of original sin. i’m a big fan. my political dogma has surely been established by now. i am against “doing” anything. fight for a world in which nothing exciting happens, other than the pursuit of beauty, goodness, and truth. fight relentlessly — by example. here in parkdale, toronto’s go-to centre for the criminally insane, there is always entertainment. from my balconata i can spy several half-way houses, and for variety, a tibetan temple. the streets get quieter every day, especially the throb of the superhighways. it has been softening, as the economy bleeds away; and there are clear days with no contrails in the sky. the “green nude eel” is being accomplished. superficially, this might seem like a good thing. but because parkdale has been unable to start a war with our bourgeois neighbour — liberty village, where the childless young professionals live in sterilized apartment blocks — we have had to look for excitement elsewhere. by calling 9-1-1 frequently, the vallishortensians (demonym for “parkdale”) are able to keep the sirens blaring, and little knots of emergency vehicles collecting, to no definable purpose here and there. due to my scottish genetic endowment, i follow these skits as i would a taxi-meter: how much have we cost the taxpayers

unwanted european, us-american and japanese imperialism. distrust and tensions marked all contacts with foreigners. secret societies were formed to propagate against the enemy. the yihequan, also known as boxers, quickly rose to one of the biggest organisations in northern china. masters of close combat, they mainly targeted converted chinese christians and attacks increased wildly in the 1880s. from 1900 empress dowager cixi was less and less opposed to the rebellion, as she hoped to fight back foreign influence. shortly after, even the chinese army started helping the rebels and foreigners were fought, killed or driven out. consequently, an alliance of the imperial powers sent in 50,000 soldiers to end the massacre. tough reprisals and treaties followed. learn all about the

think it’s important to look beyond personalities and current political issues. yes, jeremy corbyn was a repulsive figure, and that played a significant role in labor’s defeat; yes, brexit upended british politics. but if we look at the demographics of who voted labor, it is not difficult to discern larger and longer-term forces in play. who voted labor? recent immigrants. university students. urban professionals. the wealthy and the near wealthy. people who make their living by slinging words and images, not wrenches or hammers. other than recent immigrants, the labor voting base is now predominantly elite. this is the great inversion – in great britain, marxist-derived left politics has become the signature of the overclass even as the working class has abandoned it. indeed, an increasingly important feature of left politics in britain is a visceral and loudly expressed loathing of the working class. to today’s british leftist, the worst thing you can be is a “gammon”. the word literally means “ham”, but is metaphorically an older white male with a choleric complexion. a working-class white male, vulgar and uneducated – the term is never used to refer to men in upper socio-economic strata. and, of course, all gammons are presumed to be reactionary bigots; that’s the payload of the insult. catch any labor talking head on video in the first days after the election and what you’d see is either tearful, disbelieving shock or a venomous rant about gammons and how racist, sexist, homophobic, and fascist they are. they haven’t recovered yet as i write, eleven days later. observe what has occurred: the working class are now reactionaries. new labor is entirely composed of what an old leninist would have called “the revolutionary vanguard” and their immigrant clients. is it any wonder that some laborites now speak openly of demographic replacement, of swamping the gammons with brown immigrants? it would be entertaining to talk about the obvious parallels in american politics – british “gammons” map straight to american “deplorables”, of course, and i’m not even close to first in noticing how alike donald trump and boris johnson are – but i think it is more interesting to take a longer-term view and examine the causes of the great inversion in both countries. eric s. raymond, “the great inversion”, armed and dangerous, 2019-12-23. share this:

lgbt, progressives, socialjustice, university, wuhancoronavirus — nicholas @ 03:00 like everyone, i’m tired of the wuhan flu freakout. but i owe a debt to future historians to leave them a primary source, so i’m going to do this last brief post on it, then move on. unless something major happens, this is my final word on the subject […] we’ve written a lot here on the west’s “crisis of legitimacy.” well … this is it. let’s break down some of the big factors in play: the first, biggest, and in some ways only factor that matters, legitimacy-wise, is cognitive dissonance. we spent a lot of time here back in the days arguing about whether or not it’s a real thing […] i finally took the position that it’s real, but only for stuff that rises to level of actual cognition … which you just don’t see too much of anymore. indeed, the whole point of postmodern leftism, when you come right down to it, is not having to think. identity politics gives you the one right answer for most every situation; it’s just a matter of filling in the social justice mad lib. any apparent conflict between one right answers is dealt with by ad hominem. an example will probably help: trannies vs. feminists. feminists, of course, are all in on the one right answer that “gender is just a social construction.” but trannies actually believe this — if you feel you’re really a woman, then you are, your twelve-inch wang be damned. how, then, can impeccably #woke lesbians refuse to have sex with the aforesaid twelve-inch wang, since gender is just a social construction and thundercock identifies as a lesbian? easy: ad hominem. oh, gender’s just a social construction all right … it’s just that any be-penised individual who “constructs” himself as a lesbian is lying for personal gain (#wokeness, as everyone knows, gives one the ability to read minds). this isn’t a problem for the left as a whole, much less for our entire society, because of the tiny numbers involved. despite showing up pretty much everywhere in popular culture, gays are a small fraction of the population. trannies are a fraction of a fraction, and since militant lesbianism is almost entirely political anyway (lesbian bed death is very real), about the only place this could possibly be a live issue is on the loonier college campuses. severian, “the real crisis”, rotten chestnuts, 2020-03-17. share

papacy, rome — nicholas @ 02:00 overly sarcastic productions published 30 jun 2015 content disclaimer: this video no longer meets my standards of quality for historical research and presentation. i made this one in the days long past, when the question of “how do i make an entertaining and historically interesting video” was answered by “idk, memes i guess?”. this video in particular was an experiment with a shorter format, and is by no means definitive history. take the video above with a grain of salt and enjoy the jokes. in what could be a landmark in terms of progress, overly sarcastic productions has decided to start making short videos as well as rather long ones. the borgias were one messed up family, i tell you what. share this: twitter reddit email print more linkedin

marketing, writing — nicholas @ 01:00 … the push-model of book sales. long before there was an amazon, chain bookstores had cozy deals with publishers that sent most indie bookstores (now beloved in effigy by the left) out of business. and then the left dominated publishing establishment had a brilliant idea. for decades they’d been trying to forecast failure and success, and failings. books they pushed out the wazzoo (a river in sundon’tshine) died on the vine when bookstores refused to stock them because the owners had read them. the books they had designated as to be ignored caught someone’s fancy, and suddenly were all over. this was inefficient. it caused way too much printing that never got distributed, and much last minute rushed reprinting. (even leaving aside how often people chose to read the wrong things, something that started to matter more and more in the last two decades.) so they came up with the push model. it was, from a certain perspective, brilliant. that perspective is the one where the real world doesn’t really exist, so you don’t need to hear from it. because the managers of the big corporate bookstores also didn’t read, they took instruction beautifully. so the publishers could say “you’ll take 100 of x and 2 of y” and they did. for a little while it worked beautifully, in the sense that there were no surprise bestsellers, (and publishing houses hated those. i know someone who unexpectedly sold out her print run in a week. the publishing house took the book out of print. no, seriously.) and the books that got seen and talked about were picked by the publisher. (btw this wasn’t even always or primarily political. sure, that existed too sometimes, but mostly it was the crazy fads that publishing convinced itself of. for instance, sometime in the mid two thousands they convinced themselves no one wanted historical mysteries — they weren’t selling, true, probably because they were on no shelves — but everyone wanted “chick-lit mysteries” that had covers with lots of shoes and dresses and whose plots were “sex in the city with murder.” i remember trying to find something to read, giving up and going to the used bookstore (then a hundred miles away in denver) for my mystery fix.) of course, they sold less. in fact, as time went on and people got out of the habit of going to the bookstore, because there was never anything they could find to read. i mean, i remember being chased from science fiction to mystery to finally history, to at last the sort of “utility” book you find in the discount bins you know “a chart of history” type of thing just to find something to buy on our bookstore night. then we gave up. eventually the broken feedback mechanism gave us the demise of borders — and b & n is not feeling so good itself — and a yawning, desperate chasm in customers’ need for books that meant the way was wide open for indie and amazon. even the early badly proofed indie books were like a breath of fresh air because for the first time i could read outside the trends being pushed. sarah hoyt, “breaking the gears”, according to hoyt, 2018-01-03. share this: twitter reddit email print more linkedin pinterest pocket facebook tumblr comments (0) march 24, 2020 thompson 1921: the original chicago typewriter filed under: history, military, usa, weapons — tags: guns, innovation, submachineguns — nicholas @ 02:00 forgotten weapons published 6 oct 2018 https://www.forgottenweapons.com/thom… http://www.patreon.com/forgottenweapons cool forgotten weapons merch! http://shop.bbtv.com/collections/forg… the first prototype thompsons submachine guns (and it was thompson who coined that term, by the way) were produced in 1919 and dubbed the “annihilators”. the gun was intended to be a military weapon to equip american soldiers in world war one, but by the time the gun was developed the war had ended. still, thompson and his auto-ordnance company contracted with colt to manufacture 15,000 of the guns. these were the model of 1921, and they were marketed to both the us military and as many european armies as thompson and his salesmen could reach. they found few takers in the climate of the early 1920s, however, and sales were slow. this is the first in a 5-part series about the development of the thompson, concluding with a trip to the range to fire three different patterns side by side… contact: forgotten weapons po box 87647 tucson, az 85754 if you enjoy forgotten weapons, check out its sister channel, inrangetv!
