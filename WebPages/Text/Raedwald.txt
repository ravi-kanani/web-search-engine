universal suffrage, the secret ballot and the freedom to form and participate in political parties. in addition to movement controls, we are likely to see food rationing, possibly even energy rationing and internet and phone restrictions, controls on internet shopping and deliveries, import controls, currency controls and unprecedented state use of mobile phone location and activity data to police and monitor public behaviour. these may all be used to ensure the greatest benefit for the greatest number whilst the crisis subsists. but paradoxically it will not be libertarians praying for the early development of a vaccine (which may also be compulsory - and sod the anti-vaxers. they will disappear along with the food faddists) but the central statists; the longer and deeper the restrictions on our freedoms, the stronger and wider the public backlash, and the bigger the big bang demolition of the central state to come. there will be an interesting re-discovery of moral exactitude and an intolerance of moral relativity. we will get used to the idea of collectivist libertarianism. as a libertarian, i have long accepted that the freedoms i demand only extend so far as they cause no harm to any other. libertarianism isn't the sort of me-generation selfishness that drives many of the objections to the lockdown measures, but the freedom to make your own decisions about your own life within an utterly essential collective, within a society and nation. and without ceding some freedoms to the collective, we cannot enjoy individual liberty. but these are points for debate and discussion, not a didactic prescription. and that will be new for us. perhaps not since the age of huxley and orwell will there have been such a national debate, will we engage in such dialogue over existential definitions, identity and morality. the paradox is that the wuhan virus, from the heart of the most repressive nation on earth, may catalyse for us a freedom unknown for a century. at 05:27 45 comments: links to this post email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: planning, post-virus tuesday, 24 march 2020 living under lockdown well, it's here. boris had no choice. and whilst my underlying beliefs remain unchanged, there are no libertarians in a plague or in a war of national existence. just as our forefathers accepted conscription and rationing, we must accept lockdown. breaching the terms is as treasonous as ignoring the black-out and shining a light up to enemy bombers. we've had lockdown here for a week already. the local spar is fine - after an initial run on toilet paper, the staff worked with a fury to get stuff onto the shelves faster than folk were taking it off, with the result that yesterday the shelves and aisles were groaning with easter stuff. i have some migrants from italy - they come every year. black redstarts. usually two pairs. so rare in the uk that i once had to spend (planning condition) Â£300,000 installing a 'brown roof' on a new building for them; much to the chagrin of the client. the ecology people said they liked old bombsites, with plenty of demolition rubble, burnt wood and fireweed. actually, they just like flies - or insects anyway - each pair eating some 1.5kg during the breeding season. and whilst the locals regard them as a bloody nuisance, i welcome them. they're ugly, they can't sing for shit and they're not entertaining like tits, but just for the untold millions that they cost uk developers, they're fab. stay safe all and let's take care of each other. eu/eea and the uk sum of cases sum of deaths italy 59138 5476 spain 28572 1720 germany 24774 94 france 16018 674 united_kingdom 5683 281 netherlands 4204 179 austria 3631 16 belgium 3401 75 norway 2132 7 sweden 1906 21 portugal 1600 14 denmark 1395 13 czech_republic 1165 1 ireland 906 4 luxembourg 798 8 poland 634 7 finland 626 1 greece 624 15 iceland 568 1 romania 433 2 slovenia 414 1 estonia 326 0 croatia 235 1 bulgaria 185 3 slovakia 185 0 hungary 167 7 lithuania 143 1 latvia 139 0 cyprus 95 0 malta 90 0 liechtenstein 46 0 total 160233 8622 at 06:25 36 comments: links to this post email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: covid-19, lockdown monday, 23 march 2020 bounceback & backlogs we must not forget when throwing money at workers and businesses where we want to end up when the virus crisis is past. before we spend every pound we must turn it over twice, as my mother used to say. this is not a demand shock - the nation did not want to stop spending. but we must realise that covid-19 will change everything, and when it is over our spending patterns will undoubtedly have changed. we must not waste money on businesses and activities that have no future. the virus is a system shock that will accelerate changes that are happening anyway - but how do we decide what to fund, how to fund it and on what terms? airlines the case for lhr's extra runway has become much weaker. i can't see demand for global travel ever recovering to the point it was at in november 2019, and that means airlines, which are anyway on the cusp of profitability, going bust and allowing it to happen. what do we save? well, we're back to national carriers all over the world, so we must fund ba. and easyjet is our national budget carrier, so deserving of support. let the others fall, including branson's virgin. the high street the slow decline of the high street has seen chain stores struggle to survive in the face of crippling rent and rates. the government's last budget offered some relief, but after a period of enforced close down will the high street post-covid ever return to what it was? the streetscape of our towns and cities is relatively recent, dating largely from the mid 19th century, so it's not an immutable part of our heritage. bounceback when it is possible to lift restrictions - and suggestions are that this might be stop-start - demand will return and we must do everything we can to ensure the effects of bounceback leave us where we want to be. for some businesses, there will be a permanent loss of income. if you normally go to the barbers every month, after four month's absence you won't have four haircuts - all that income is lost. offering loans to such businesses is pointless - imposing a burden they are unlikely to recoup in increased trade. backlogs in contrast will see a huge burst of spending as at the end of rationing when buyers create four months of sales in a month; loans to such businesses to keep them ticking over make eminent sense. computers, diy goods, home improvements may be such. ai we saw the end of the trade of tube driver last week. the pics that hit the press and social media of dangerously crowded tubes because drivers were self-isolating in large numbers, when not a single dlr formation was cancelled, means the end of public opposition to driverless tube trains - meaning more of them, travelling more closely to eachother, more safely and less crowded, is only now a matter of time. similarly across the economy. the environment i think across the entire world the effect of the standstill is striking billions of people as to the effects on both our world and ourselves of human activity. choking clouds of so2 and smog lifted from cities, bird song audible in london. we won't quite see dolphins in the regent's canal, but the effect will be salutary - and not going back will become a politically saleable option. the b ark we're finding out today who doesn't want their children at home. the most extraordinary melange of b-ark passengers are claiming 'key worker' status, from nail painters, personal trainers and hashish purveyors to uber drivers and artisan avocado-mashers. i reckon about 80% of these folk could easily be re-employed out in the fields. we need to subsidise only those activities that create the greatest total benefit for society and nation it's going to be very interesting. update ====== boris is under tremendous pressure from his entire team to introduce a full lockdown - we must at least credit him with resisting it for so long on libertarian grounds. however, i think the science is against him. and fieldworkers? uhm, metaphorical. it's my opinion that everyone on the b-ark is free to carry on what they're doing at their own expense - but if they want public money, they must help feed and dress the cared-for - or similar collectively useful employments - rather than painting nails or spraying tanning fluid. at 08:34 14 comments: links to this post email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: planning, post-covid sunday, 22 march 2020 some numbers ... just a few numbers this morning that are causing the grey cells to spark. first, the news story that germany has broken its 'balanced budget' dirge and has committed to â¬356bn of new debt - some 10% of gdp. already europe is preparing for a forthcoming 'fire sale' of some of its largest industrial assets - and british hawks are circling, hoping to pluck up some tasty morsels. with europe's bourses having fallen 30% - 40% in recent weeks, many are on the edge. the protective germans know the risk - "we will not allow a bargain sale of german economic and industrial interests," economic affairs minister peter altmaier said on friday. "there should be no taboos. temporary state aid for a limited period, up to and including shareholdings and takeovers, must be possible." you'll note that it is the risk to german and not eu assets that has prompted the volte-face. some solidarity, mein herren. just for comparison, here are the global benchmarks of 10% of gdp ($s) gdp $bn 10% bench $bn usa 20,490 2,049 china 13,400 1,340 japan 4,970 497 germany 4,000 400 uk 2,830 283 france 2,780 278 india 2,720 272 italy 2,070 207 brazil 1,870 187 canada 1,710 171 but germany faces a dilemma. save the zombie banks or allow the stressed carmakers to use their liquidity to develop ev technologies? qe has left many big companies with fat cash reserves, and even german taxpayers will grumble if hard-working max musterman's wedge is thrown to vw whilst they are still sitting on their own cash-pile. here's another chart so vw hanging in there with a market cap of $52bn ... but here's where it gets interesting. as bloomberg reports, vw is already sitting on a cash pile of $23bn - over 5% of the german chancellor's entire spending commitment. and the company would rather lay-off staff and close plants than spend it - foreign plants and workers to go first - as ce herbert diess was quoted as saying "drastic measures to protect liquidity" are required to tackle the crisis, diess said saturday in a message on vwâs intranet and later posted on linkedin. he said safeguarding the availability of spare parts and battery-cell supply are among the initiatives that are also "extremely important." how this will play with german voters i don't know. but it's all getting quite interesting. one of the downsides of industrial socialism is that taxpayers will want a say in what is being done with their money. at 06:55 12 comments: links to this post email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: opportunities, recession friday, 20 march 2020 it's all about china let's not forget where the wuhan virus originated. despite a highly co-ordinated campaign that in the uk has roped in the usual suspects including sadiq khan and david lammy, the public are stubborn in continuing to say and post that this virus comes from china. even parts of the un (no surprise) have launched a campaign to tell us that the wuhan virus is the result of deforestation and global warming, and it's nothing to do with eating bats or wet markets at all. but sometimes there are no heroes and no villains. i wrote a post recently that regarded china favourably in airfreighting vital medical kit to italy at a time when france and germany had banned sending such stuff and the eu was deaf to italian appeals. as usual, one well-informed commentator added the necessary perspective to the piece. no, neither china nor the eu deserve congratulation. neither are heroes, both have damaged italy. i read it wrong. where i stand absolutely shoulder to shoulder with sadiq khan and david lammy is that this is not the fault of people from china who are working and raising families in our communities. perhaps if they'd had the balls or the sense to say so instead of excusing the people's dictatorship of china then their message might have been more widely heard. any attacks on or discrimination or harassment against chinese people is inexcusable and unacceptable. the irony is that many, at least in london, will be those and the descendants of those who have fled the prc. the chinese government, bless 'em, having precipitated a global pandemic and millions of (coming) deaths by first trying to hide then lying about the wuhan virus are taking a lesson from the eu in using this as a 'beneficial crisis' to tighten the belt and road bonds with italy and drive a wedge between the country and the rest of europe. the 'chinese school' cartoon below has recently surfaced on social media. well, sorry, guys - this sort of crude propaganda may play well amongst the third world, but europeans remain amongst the most politically sophisticated voters in the world, and this just makes china look crude and silly. at 05:35 19 comments: links to this post email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: china, failure thursday, 19 march 2020 shooting the first rioter - a london timeline if one thing is clear from the chaotic scenes on tv and social media of the undisciplined selfishness at our supermarkets, it is clear that the uk is not the place that many liked to think it was. and london, filthy, crowded, raw london with the highest multi-drug resistant tb rates outside iraq, ethiopia and afghanistan, is worst of all. when quentin reynolds described the resilience of londoners on humphrey jennings's 'london can take it' he was documenting a very different london to today's city. watching the fights break out over toilet roll at a time when there was no food shortage and the chip shops were open, one has to wonder what it will be like when food shortages start to bite, as they surely will. people who have never used their kitchens in london will be lost. me? i love to cook. so my shelves are already full with dried ingredients and the staples - polpa, coconut milk, onions, dried onions, garlic, garlic paste, tomato paste, and herbs and spices in ranks of big kilner jars (tip: never again buy those sully little supermarket bottles. order your turmeric, smoked paprika, peppercorns, garam masala, mustard powder etc in 200g packets - 200g of turmeric is the same price as one of those little curvy 28g jars. when the pizza and cocaine run short - and you can bet the crisis is affecting the supply chains for illegal drugs as well as everything else - then tempers will also run short. someone will pull out a zombie knife in tesco. a shop worker will die in a pool of blood, and armed troops will be posted to london's supermarkets. a wilding gang will run at a guarded supermarket entrance, and a young soldier will open fire. it hasn't even started yet. at 06:43 30 comments: links to this post email thisblogthis!share to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels: failure, public order older posts home subscribe to: posts (atom) about me raedwald irredeemable optimist proud of my nation not funded either by advertising or from any other source completely independent view my complete profile email me email raedwaldblog@gmail.com twitter is evil twitter is evil kreis our circle guardian reader offers daily reality fixes zerohedge news when, exactly, was the moment when the financial world broke with reality?
