redirection by john godley details reviews installation support development description redirection is the most popular redirect manager for wordpress. with it you can easily manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and generally tidy up any loose ends your site may have. this can help reduce errors and improve your site ranking. redirection is designed to be used on sites with a few redirects to sites with thousands of redirects. it has been a wordpress plugin for over 10 years and has been recommended countless times. and it’s free! full documentation can be found at https://redirection.me redirection is compatible with php from 5.6 and upwards (including 7.4). redirect manager create and manage redirects quickly and easily without needing apache or nginx knowledge. if your wordpress supports permalinks then you can use redirection to redirect any url. there is full support for regular expressions so you can create redirect patterns to match any number of urls. you can match query parameters and even pass them through to the target url. the plugin can also be configured to monitor when post or page permalinks are changed and automatically create a redirect to the new url. conditional redirects in addition to straightforward url matching you can redirect based on other conditions: login status – redirect only if the user is logged in or logged out wordpress capability – redirect if the user is able to perform a certain capability browser – redirect if the user is using a certain browser referrer – redirect if the user visited the link from another page cookies – redirect if a particular cookie is set http headers – redirect based on a http header custom filter – redirect based on your own wordpress filter ip address – redirect if the client ip address matches server – redirect another domain if also hosted on this server page type – redirect if the current page is a 404 full logging a configurable logging option allows to view all redirects occurring on your site, including information about the visitor, the browser used, and the referrer. a ‘hit’ count is maintained for each redirect so you can see if a url is being used. logs can be exported for external viewing, and can be searched and filtered for more detailed investigation. display geographic information about an ip address, as well as a full user agent information, to try and understand who the visitor is. you are able to disable or reduce ip collection to meet the legal requirements of your geographic region. add http headers http headers can be adder to redirects or your entire site that help reduce the impact of redirects or help increase security. you can also add your own custom headers. track 404 errors redirection will keep track of all 404 errors that occur on your site, allowing you to track down and fix problems. errors can be grouped to show where you should focus your attention, and can be redirected in bulk. query parameter handling you can match query parameters exactly, ignore them, and even pass them through to your target. apache & nginx support by default redirection will manage all redirects using wordpress. however you can configure it so redirects are automatically saved to a .htaccess file and handled by apache itself. if you use nginx then you can export redirects to an nginx rewrite rules file. fine-grained permissions fine-grained permissions are available so you can customise the plugin for different users. this makes it particularly suitable for client sites where you may want to prevent certain actions, and remove functionality. import & export the plugin has a fully-featured import and export system and you can: import and export to apache .htaccess export to nginx rewrite rules copy redirects between sites using json import and export to csv for viewing in a spreadsheet use wp cli to automate import and export you can also import from the following plugins: simple 301 redirects seo redirection safe redirect manager rank math wordpress old slug redirects wait, it’s free? yes, it’s really free. there’s no premium version and no need to pay money to get access to features. this is a dedicated redirect management plugin. support please submit bugs, patches, and feature requests to: https://github.com/johngodley/redirection please submit translations to: https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/redirection screenshots redirection management interface adding a redirection redirect logs import/export options support installation the plugin is simple to install: download redirection.zip unzip upload redirection directory to your /wp-content/plugins directory go to the plugin management page and enable the plugin configure the options from the manage/redirection page you can find full details of installing a plugin on the plugin installation page. full documentation can be found on the redirection page. faq why would i want to use this instead of .htaccess? ease of use. redirections are automatically created when a post url changes, and it is a lot easier to manually add redirections than to hack around a .htaccess. you also get the added benefit of being able to keep track of 404 errors. what is the performance of this plugin? the plugin works in a similar manner to how wordpress handles permalinks and should not result in any noticeable slowdown to your site. reviews easy to use, works wonderfully! clarityeditor march 17, 2020 a wonderful plug-in! it works great and is so simple to use. i love it, thank you!! great plugin
