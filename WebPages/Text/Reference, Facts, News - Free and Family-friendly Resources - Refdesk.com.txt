comes new strength and new thoughts." - eleanor roosevelt ---------------------- thought of the day archive motivational quotes of the day book of the month i will always write back by alifirenks and ganda 2015 "how one letter changed two lives" a pennsylvania schoolgirl and a poor zimbabwean boy exchange letters. they live in two very different worlds. she sends him american money and asks to see his version. he struggles to even eat. eventually, her babysitting money is essential to saving his family from eviction and paying for his school fees. this is a charming story and well told, with chapters alternating in viewpoint between the two friends. its sobering to learn the difficulties of the boy and amusing to see the gradual growth of understanding by the girl of another less privileged world. we liked this book much more than expected, and our local bookclub readers loved it too. get the book! today in history: associated press | bbc | history channel | historynet |
