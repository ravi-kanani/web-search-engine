access bank-monument website theroyalexchange.co.uk the royal exchange in london was founded in the 16th century by the merchant sir thomas gresham on the suggestion of his factor richard clough to act as a centre of commerce for the city of london.[1] the site was provided by the city of london corporation and the worshipful company of mercers, who still jointly own the freehold. it is trapezoidal in shape and is flanked by cornhill and threadneedle street, which converge at bank junction in the heart of the city. it lies in the ward of cornhill. the building's original design was inspired by a bourse gresham had seen in antwerp, the antwerp bourse, and was britain's first specialist commercial building. it has twice been destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt. the present building was designed by sir william tite in the 1840s. the site was notably occupied by the lloyd's insurance market for nearly 150 years. today the royal exchange contains a courtyard grand cafe, threadneedle cocktail bar, sauterelle restaurant, luxury shops, and offices. traditionally, the steps of the royal exchange is the place where certain royal proclamations (such as the dissolution of parliament) are read out by either a herald or a crier. following the death or abdication of a monarch and the confirmation of the next monarch's accession to the throne by the accession council, the royal exchange building is one of the locations where a herald proclaims the new monarch's reign to the public. contents 1 history 1.1 current building 1.2 portico and pediment 1.3 statues 1.4 the

suggested building the exchange in 1562, and oversaw the importing of some of the materials from antwerp: stone, slate, wainscot and glass, for which he paid thousands of pounds himself.[2][3] the royal exchange was officially opened on 23 january 1571 by queen elizabeth i who awarded the building its royal title and a licence to sell alcohol and valuable goods.[4] only the exchange of goods took place until the 17th century. stockbrokers were not allowed into the royal exchange because of their rude manners, hence they had to operate from other establishments in the vicinity, such as jonathan's coffee-house. gresham's original building was destroyed in the great fire of london in 1666. a second complex was built on the site, designed by edward jarman and opened in 1669, but that also burned down, on 10 january 1838.[5] it had been used by the lloyd's insurance market, which was forced to move temporarily to south sea house following the 1838 fire. current building the third royal exchange building, which still stands today, was designed by sir william tite and adheres to the original layout–consisting of a four-sided structure surrounding a central courtyard where merchants and tradesmen could do business. the internal works, designed by edward i'anson in 1837, made use of concrete—an early example of this modern construction method.[6] it features pediment sculptures by richard westmacott (the younger), and ornamental cast ironwork by henry grissell's regent's canal ironworks. it was opened by queen victoria on 28 october 1844 though trading did not commence until 1 january 1845. in june 1844, just before the reopening of the royal exchange, a statue of arthur wellesley, 1st duke of wellington, was unveiled outside the building. the bronze used to cast it was sourced from enemy cannons captured during wellington's continental campaigns. paul julius reuter established the reuters news agency at no. 1, royal exchange buildings (opposite and to the east of the royal exchange) in 1851. it later moved to fleet street. aerial view from the rear plan of the ground floor plan of the first floor portico and pediment detail of the pediment sculpture the western end of the building consists of a portico of eight corinthian columns topped by a pediment containing a tympanum with a sculptured frieze by richard westmacott (the younger). the central figure represents commerce, above an inscription from the bible: "the earth is the lord's, and the fulness thereof". the latin inscription states that the exchange was founded in the thirteenth year of queen elizabeth, and restored in the eighth of queen victoria.[7] statues two statues stand in niches in the central courtyard. charles ii a copy of 1792 by john spiller after grinling gibbons' statue in the centre of the c17 courtyard, and queen elizabeth i by m. l. watson, 1844. the charles ii statue survived the fire of 1838 that destroyed the previous exchange. the elizabeth i statue was commissioned as she was the monarch who had conferred the status "royal" on the exchange.[8][9][10] the gresham grasshopper the golden gresham grasshopper can be seen on the royal exchange's weathervane. this commemorates the founder, sir thomas gresham, whose crest it is featured on. the device possibly inspired shem drowne, who designed a similar grasshopper weathervane atop the faneuil hall in boston, massachusetts. murals from 1892, twenty-four scenes from london's history were painted on the first-floor walls by artists including sir frederick leighton, sir frank

disrepair – particularly the glass roof was in danger of collapse. the newly-formed london international financial futures exchange (liffe) was the main tenant, using the courtyard for the trading floor, all done without touching the framework of the original building. other tenants moved in later and as a result of liffe's presence, not only did the city experience growth in trading and greater efficiency in pricing, but also a boost to the area around the royal exchange which had hitherto been sleepy at best. in 2001 the royal exchange (interiors and courtyard) was once again extensively remodelled, this time by architects aukett fitzroy robinson. reconstruction of the courtyard created new boutiques and restaurants to add to the existing retailers on the perimeter. the royal exchange is now a retail centre with shops, cafes and restaurants. the restaurants include royal exchange grand cafe, threadneedle cocktail bar and sauterelle restaurant. shops include boodles, hermès, georg jensen and tiffany & co. in 2003 the grand café and bar was launched and completed the building. in royal exchange buildings, a lane by the eastern entrance to the royal exchange, stand two statues: one of paul julius reuter who founded his news agency there, and one of george peabody who founded the peabody trust and a business which became j.p. morgan & co. in 2013 the royal exchange was sold by the anglo irish private bank to oxford properties, a canadian property company. it had been announced that the site would be sold with a 104-year lease.[11] oxford properties group, a division of the ontario municipal employees retirement system, bought the retail centre for a reported £86.5 million.[12] see also st bartholomew-by-the-exchange london troops war memorial,

the first stone was laid june 7, 1566, and the building opened by queen elizabeth in person, january 23, 1570-1571. the materials for the construction of the exchange were brought from flanders, or, as holinshed has it, gresham "bargained for the whole mould and substance of his workmanship in flanders," and a flemish builder of the name of henryke was employed. in general design the exchange was not unlike the burse at antwerp —a quadrangle, with a cloister running round the interior of the building, a corridor or "pawn " above, and attics or bedrooms at the top. on the south or cornhill front was a bell-tower, and on the north a lofty corinthian column, each surmounted by a grasshopper—the crest of the greshams. the bell, in gresham's time, was rung at twelve at noon and at six in the evening. in niches within the quadrangle, and immediately above the cloister or covered walk, stood the statues of our kings and queens, from edward the confessor to queen elizabeth. james i., charles i., and charles ii. were afterwards added. charles i.'s statue was thrown down immediately after his execution, and on the pedestal these words were inscribed in gilt letters, exit tyrannus regum ultimas - "the tyrant is gone, the last of the kings." hume concludes his history of charles i. with this little anecdote of city disaffection, which no doubt was in addison's mind when he made his tory fox-hunter satisfied that the london merchants had not turned republicans "when he spied the statue of king charles ii. standing up in the middle of the crowd, and most of the kings in baker's chronicle ranged in order over their heads." gresham's exchange was destroyed in the great fire of 1666. pepys describes its appearance as "a sad sight, nothing standing there of all the statues or pillars, but sir thomas gresham in the corner." ---london, past and present. h.b. wheatley, 1891. log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 jan 28 feb 7 11 28 mar 7 16 29 apr 22 jul 7 nov 22 1661 jan 9 feb 8 11 18 mar 12 apr 20 22 may 7 13 17 20 28 jun 19 24 jul 4 25 aug 14 28 31 sep 2 14 nov 24 dec 20 1662 jan 1 11 mar 15 17 20 apr 7 9 11 may 6 8 24 jun 18 20 23 24 25 jul 31 aug 1 15 sep 8 10 16 17 oct 27 nov 17 dec 27 30 1663 jan 6 12 23 24 feb 6 mar 25 26 27 apr 7 10 22 24 25 30 may 2 4 6 22 28 jun 3 10 12 13 19 23 jul 2 3 14 16 17 31 aug 5 6 8 11 19 25 27 29 sep 5 12 26 oct 2 12 13 14 16 21 30 nov 2 6 10 11 12 13 16 17 19 20 23 24 25 26 27 28 30 dec 3 8 12 16 22 23 29 30 31 1664 jan 2 5 6 8 12 13 15 16 18 19 20 21 25 26 27 28 feb 1 2 3 6 8 9 12 15 16 17 19 20 22 23 24 29 mar 1 4 5 7 8 10 11 12 14 16 17 23 26 30 apr 1 2 7 12 15 18 19 21 23 26 27 28 29 30 may 2 3 4 5 21 28 jun 2 3 7 16 22 23 28 jul 1 2 4 5 8 14 15 16 18 22 23 27 28 29 30 aug 2 3 7 12 15 16 20 23 24 25 26 27 28 sep 1 2 5 7 14 15 16 18 20 21 22 26 oct 3 4 5 10 17 21 24 28 nov 3 4 5 11 12 14 15 17 18 21 25 30 dec 6 10 12 14 16 17 22 24 1665 jan 3 4 11 12 13 14 17 23 24 27 31 feb 1 2 3 4 6 11 14 15 16 18 20 21 22 23 25 27 mar 3 4 8 10 13 15 17 18 21 22 23 28 apr 4 6 7 8 10 11 19 21 may 1 3 8 10 12 13 30 31 jun 1 5 7 9 15 19 23 30 jul 4 5 11 14 18 22 25 26 29 aug 16 28 sep 14 oct 16 26 27 nov 22 24 dec 4 8 11 13 14 18 20 27 1666 jan 5 8 10 12 13 14 19 22 26 31 feb 1 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 23 mar 3 5 12 14 16 21 apr 2 4 9 18 21 27 may 11 23 25 jun 3 4 7 26 27 jul 13 aug 13 14 15 16 18 sep 5 15 21 oct 6 19 nov 9 12 14 16 21 dec 12 13 15 17 21 24 1667 jan 1 16 29 31 feb 22 25 27 28 mar 6 15 22 27 29 apr 5 6 9 11 18 24 25 30 may 8 22 23 jul 11 20 22 27 29 aug 5 sep 14 18 23 oct 21 23 nov 4 26 dec 5 9 12 19 28 30 1668 jan 8 10 13 18 20 25 feb 8 12 14 mar 2 9 19 27 apr 15 may 27 jun 2 jul 1 16 18 20 aug 3 10 12 21 22 sep 14 15 23 nov 18 25 dec 14 21 22 23 29 30 1669 jan 1 11 18 21 22 29 feb 15 mar 1 apr 10 13 23 26 maps see all places in this category on one map latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
