(this was slightly disappointing of me. turkey is a country of terrific food, and one should plan one’s meals better than just going for the nearest food when one finds oneself hungry). i got out my phone and started reading a book on the kindle app as i was having my lunch. after an indeterminate period of time, i realised i was hearing a high pitched scream behind me. it was probably a woman, but i couldn’t be sure about that. i turned around. there was an almost literal phalanx of riot police, separating the public from what was going on. there was a police van on the other side of the riot police. the person who was screaming was somewhat violently pushed into the van. the rear doors of the van were then closed fairly violently. the van drove off. the riot police then dispersed. they looked like this was heavily rehearsed, and this was something they did every day. there was no riot. there was no demonstration. i don’t know how this started, because i was looking in the opposite direction and i was distracted until i heard the screaming. this looked like a well planned operation to grab a particular person off the street. in broad daylight. in the middle of a busy city. so that people would notice. when i saw that this was happening, i noticed that other people in the cafe were taking pictures with their phones. so i briefly stood up and took a picture with my phone. the police were looking in other directions. one day i will get myself into trouble doing things like this, but in this case, well, i think the police wanted to be noticed. by locals, at least. maybe not foreigners such as myself. a few days later, after visiting a few wonderful archaeological sites in parts of turkey, i was on a bus travelling along the turkish black sea coast from trabzon to the georgian city of batumi. during this journey there were two stops at police checkpoints. at the first one, a police officer got on the bus and everyone was required to show id. the turkish people had bar codes on their id cards scanned electronically by a reader being carried by the police officer. (i held out my passport – the policeman looked at it and nodded). at the second one our id documents were taken off the bus and into the police checkpoint building, before being brought back on the bus. when you book a train ticket in turkey and you are turkish, you don’t even need a ticket. you simply give your id card number when booking the train, and when you board they scan the id card and associate it with the booking. turkey tracks the internal movements of its citizens electronically. they do it like this if you catch a bus or train or plane. if you drive your own car, i suspect it is done with number plate recognition. turkey is a wonderful country full of magnificent things. i visit often. it is also a police state, and a very nasty one. i enjoyed my trip to turkey, but i felt some relief when i reached georgia. a much freer country. february 16th, 2020 | 7 comments samizdata quote of the day samizdata illuminatus (arkham, massachusetts) · civil liberty & regulation · privacy & panopticon · slogans & quotations · uk affairs the wise & incorruptible state can be trusted to decide what people are allowed to watch, read & listen to, no way would they abuse such capabilities once they are in place #makeorwellfictionagain #thestateisnotyourfriend – perry de havilland in response to this. february 13th, 2020 | 23 comments samizdata quote of the day samizdata illuminatus (arkham, massachusetts) · slogans & quotations math is “oppressive,” enlightenment art is “oppressive”…the list goes on and on and on. my favorite little form of “woke” ignorance — combined with utter ignorance of romance languages — is the term “latinx.” i showed it around to some actual (aka non-“woke”) latinos and latinas at la city hall, and they were like, “wut? how do you even say that?” additionally, my personal experience with some of the woke, along with my observation, is that many are 20-something and have accomplished nothing yet, but, oh does it ever feel good to knock down the tall, accomplished poppies on “woke” grounds. – amy alkon february 11th, 2020 | 13 comments older entries » who are we? the samizdata people are a bunch of sinister and heavily armed globalist illuminati who seek to infect the entire world with the values of personal liberty and several property. amongst our many crimes is a sense of humour and the intermittent use of british spelling. we are also a varied group made up of social individualists, classical liberals, whigs, libertarians, extropians, futurists, ‘porcupines’, karl popper fetishists, recovering neo-conservatives, crazed ayn rand worshipers, over-caffeinated virginia postrel devotees, witty frédéric bastiat wannabes, cypherpunks, minarchists, kritarchists and wild-eyed anarcho-capitalists from britain, north america, australia and europe. categories categories select category ~ glossary categories (114) a (2) b (28) c (7) d (3) e (4) f (5) g (2) h (1) i (3) j (1) k (4) l (6) m (12) n (1) o (1) p (9) r (5) s (6) t (7) v (1) w (5) x (1) ~ meme hacks categories (14) detournement (3) evil empire (5) hippopotami (1) propaganda (5) ~ photos #1 categories (8) ~ photos #2 categories (11) ~ photos #3 categories (2) ~ white rose categories (667) activism (17) administrative (9) big brother (43) biometrics (40) civil liberties (103) constitution (6) european union (45) events (5) historical perspective (27) identity cards (168) liberty (16) privacy (95) security (17) self-defence (5) self-ownership (8) slogans & quotations (21) surveillance (98) technology (50) abortion (14) activism (244) administrative (132) aerospace & astronautics (541) afghanistan (80) african affairs (187) anglosphere (134) antics & parties (152) architecture (86) arts & entertainment (919) asian affairs (268) aus/nz affairs (130) balkans (44) best of samizdata.net (82) blogging & bloggers (535) book reviews (145) children’s issues (121) chinese affairs (21) civil liberty & regulation (1,075) deleted by the pc media (48) eastern europe (128) economics, business & globalization (1,698) education & academia (336) environment (236) european affairs (383) european union (780) events (118) french affairs (263) german affairs (83) health & medical (378) hippos (19) historical views (721) how very odd!
