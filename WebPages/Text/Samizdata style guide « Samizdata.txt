samizdata a blog for people with a critically rational individualist perspective commentsposts archive editorial policy social responsibility historical wallpapers samizdata style guide credits contact we are developing the social individualist meta-context for the future. from the very serious to the extremely frivolous... lets see what is on the mind of the samizdata people. samizdata, derived from samizdat /n. - a system of clandestine publication of banned literature in the ussr [russ.,= self-publishing house] authors adriana lukas alex s alice bachini-smith andy duncan antoine clarke brian micklethwait chris cooper christopher pellerito court schuett dale amon dave shaw david carr dominique lazanski findlay dunachie frank mcgahon franklin mamo gabriel syme guest writer gustave la joie guy herbert hillary johnson jackie d james waterton john evans johnathan pearce johnny student kevin l. connors malcolm hutty midwesterner mr ed natalie solent natalija radic niall kilmartin patrick crozier paul marks perry de havilland philip chaston robert clayton dean samizdata illuminatus sarah fitz-claridge scott wickstein steph thaddeus tremayne the dissident frogman tom burroughes trevor mendham walter uhlman will stephens zem arts, tech & culture niche gamer one angry gamer prometheus blog techraptor civil liberties cato @ liberty electronic frontier foundation libertarian home no2id notes on liberty open rights group prism break reporters without borders the manifesto club the taxpayers' alliance tor project: anonymity online commentary advice goddess anonymong armed and dangerous blazing cat fur catallaxy files chicago boyz claire's inevitably interesting thoughts continental telegraph cora daily pundit damian j. penny david thompson dick puddlecote dissident frogman dominic frisby duff & nonsense!

really. no, really! blogs are like vast rolling all-seeing peer reviews: be sure of your facts, use links whenever practical and if you are just guessing, then make that abundantly clear. remember miranda: anything you say can be taken down and used in evidence against you. samizdata.net is highly successful, a true world class blog in fact, but as a result we have a number of people who would love to take us down a few pegs (down to their level) for both ideological and personal reasons. be brave! be fearless! but please… be right!!! if you need to post anonymously as ‘samizdata illuminatus’, then let the editors know that you plan to do so if you have the password (we can figure out who posts the article from the user logs but that is a pain in the arse)… but please remember that even the mighty samizdata illuminatus is not immune to libel laws (see above)! if you do not have sufficient privileges yourself to post as samizdata illuminatus but still want to, leave your article in draft and then e-mail perry, who will change the username to that of our good buddy from arkham, massachusetts. do not let idiotarian commenters piss you off. think before you reply and under no circumstances get abusive with them… doing that is the exclusive prerogative of the samizdata.net editors. seriously. if you have a blogroach polluting your article’s comment section, it is very important that you let the editorial pantheon know: do not just assume we have read your article’s comments and are aware of the problem (on a heavy day we can get several hundred comments and it is not always possible for the editors to read them all as we do have lives beyond samizdata, believe it or not). unless it is a truly egregious stream of profanity, a great long screed about how henry kissenger is a mutant space alien (well…) or how the jews are controlling our thoughts with mind-rays, as a general rule do not delete annoying comments yourself, but use your judgement… generally just tell the editors and leave pest control duties to us. but you must alert us to any problems!!! we are not samizdroids, samizdatans or samizdudes… collectively we are known as samizdatistas. these ex-cathedra statements are brought to you by the samizdata.net editorial pantheon. who are we? the samizdata people are a bunch of sinister and heavily armed globalist illuminati who seek to infect the entire world with the values of personal liberty and several property. amongst our many crimes is a sense of humour and the intermittent use of british spelling. we are also a varied group made up of social individualists, classical liberals, whigs, libertarians, extropians, futurists, ‘porcupines’, karl popper fetishists, recovering neo-conservatives, crazed ayn rand worshipers, over-caffeinated virginia postrel devotees, witty frédéric bastiat wannabes, cypherpunks, minarchists, kritarchists and wild-eyed anarcho-capitalists from britain, north america, australia and europe. categories categories select category ~ glossary categories (114) a (2) b (28) c (7) d (3) e (4) f (5) g (2) h (1) i (3) j (1) k (4) l (6) m (12) n (1) o (1) p (9) r (5) s (6) t (7) v (1) w (5) x (1) ~ meme hacks categories (14) detournement (3) evil empire (5) hippopotami (1) propaganda (5) ~ photos #1 categories (8) ~ photos #2 categories (11) ~ photos #3 categories (2) ~ white rose categories (667) activism (17) administrative (9) big brother (43) biometrics (40) civil liberties (103) constitution (6) european union (45) events (5) historical perspective (27) identity cards (168) liberty (16) privacy (95) security (17) self-defence (5) self-ownership (8) slogans & quotations (21) surveillance (98) technology (50) abortion (14) activism (244) administrative (132) aerospace & astronautics (541) afghanistan (80) african affairs (187) anglosphere (134) antics & parties (152) architecture (86) arts & entertainment (919) asian affairs (268) aus/nz affairs (130) balkans (44) best of samizdata.net (82) blogging & bloggers (535) book reviews (145) children’s issues (121) chinese affairs (21) civil liberty & regulation (1,075) deleted by the pc media (48) eastern europe (128) economics, business & globalization (1,698) education & academia (336) environment (236) european affairs (383) european union (780) events (117) french affairs (263) german affairs (83) health & medical (378) hippos (19) historical views (721) how very odd!
