(here is a good paper on the nhs by the institute of economic affairs.) i can also recommend this book, by james bartholomew on the many problems with the uk welfare state. the nhs, like many of the other socialised medical systems in much of the developed world, faces the monstrous coronavirus. and so much of the current policy approach – the uk is going into more of a lockdown as of this weekend – is designed, so it is said, to flatten the potential surge of infections and deaths, so that the nhs and other systems don’t collapse. the cost/benefit calculation is being made that it is better to smash the world economy, to force millions into idleness, possibly for months, and tide them over with cash payments funded from vast amounts of debt, than it is to allow the nhs/other to be forced into a nightmare of running out of resources. in some ways i can see the merits of preventing a horrendous surge in deaths; i also think that saving the nhs and other models of healthcare is a sort of virility test of today’s welfare states. nothing can be done to admit they have limits, even if that means economic damage on a major scale. that cost/benefit calculation may look just about defensible now, but what about in two months’ time, particularly if there is no real sign of a deceleration in the virus, but if the struggle to buy even basic household necessities leaves a lot of people in real hardship? i assume that farmers and others in the food production business are not being told to stay at home, but such is the level of madness about this situation that i wonder. i’d like to know how locking people in their homes for months is going to be enforced. there are also health considerations to be taken into account by such a lock-down, particularly if it goes on for months on end. humanity is not designed for prison, and those of us in relatively free societies (“relatively” being the operative word) will move from being restless to downright homicidal of this goes on into the summer and beyond. there aren’t enough police to keep everyone cooped up in their homes. those bastards in the chinese communist party have a lot to answer for. and yes, covid-19 began there, and it shows how derelict some of our media/political class has become that is frowned upon to point that out. (the anger is rising, and will have major consequences for our geopolitics.) it would be rather ironic to think that something unleashed by a communist state, whether by accident or whatever, has put such pressure on welfare state societies in the west. final point: i was due to give a talk tonight at brian micklethwait’s place about the recent calls for anti-trust assaults on the big techs such as facebook, google and amazon, and i was going to look at parallels with the campaign to break up j d rockefeller’s standard oil more than a century ago. one thing you can say about rockefeller, was that as well as being a brilliant businessman, and philanthropist in the area of healthcare, among others, he also understood the importance of integrated supply chains in commerce. he’d have looked at our current predicament with interest. facebook twitter reddit tumblr email march 20th, 2020 | 40 comments samizdata quote of the day natalie solent (essex) · economics, business & globalization · european union · health & medical · slogans & quotations · uk affairs there are no limits to our commitment to the euro. – christine lagarde, president of the european central bank. the linked guardian article in which i found the quote is titled “ecb u-turn shows it fears coronavirus could destroy eurozone project”. facebook twitter reddit tumblr email march 19th, 2020 | 38 comments in france you now have to download a permit to go for a walk natalie solent (essex) · civil liberty & regulation · european affairs · french affairs · health & medical · privacy & panopticon at first i thought this was une blague pratique. apparently not, unless tim worstall’s denial is merely evidence that he is in on the joke. he writes in today’s times: among the measures introduced in france to deal with the coronavirus is a requirement to fill in a form before going out for a walk. no, really, this is not a joke. as part of the lockdown it is necessary, before leaving the house, to complete and sign a download from the ministry of the interior. name, address, what you think you’re doing and so on. this is not filed with anyone, nor registered. it must simply be carried during the errand. absence, if caught, will lead to a €135 fine. a new form is required for every exit from the house. and yes, there’s a box to tick for “aux besoins des animaux de compagnie” which my memories of exchange visits have as “for the needs of our furry friends”. the solution to a global pandemic is a form for walking the dog. of course, it is easy to mock the french but there is an important point here, for this is an example of a pernicious worldview. that we, the people, are only able to cope if we are told what to do, what we may do. all must be decided and enforced by the clever people in power and nothing left to ordinary folks to get on with. our own tradition is vehemently different. i have surprised people in a number of countries by pointing out that a british policeman isn’t actually allowed to ask — or at least not to insist upon knowing — what it is that you are doing. if accosted, a cheery “going about my lawful business, constable” is all that is required. such liberties might not apply in moments of crisis but they are indicative of a different manner of thinking. a similar restriction is being applied in italy, according to the local.it: now that justification is required simply to be on the street, you’ll need to have a copy ready as soon as you leave the house. if you have access to a printer, you can download the form here. ther’s also now an application able to generate an electronic version of the ‘autocertificazione’ form as many times as needed, to keep handy on your phone with a digital signature. police at checkpoints (such as those at train stations) should also have a stack of paper forms available, and you can ask to take a few. but what if you do not have access to the internet? alternatively you can copy out the whole thing by hand: make sure to write everything exactly as it appears on the form, in full. facebook twitter reddit tumblr email march 19th, 2020 | 74 comments the death clock johnathan pearce (london) · asian affairs · media & journalism a few years ago i remember the arrival of a sort of clock that measured the terrifying rise of the uk’s public debt, a pile that has got much heavier and scarier as a result of the splurge of spending enacted by the new uk finance minister last week. the idea of some dial on the dashboard of our lives, so to speak, which rises constantly, or maybe eventually slows and reverts, is an interesting one. in the media, some newspapers seem to have these daily counts of the number of people dying of coronavirus. on some of the tv channels there is a scrolling feed at the bottom of the screen (i saw this on sky news, which is arguably even worse than the bbc these days) do this. it was rather like the tickers for the level of the s&p 500 or the latest cricket scores from lords. a writer on linkedin, whom i quote from here but i won’t name as i am not sure i have permission, has written this, and i do sort of sympathise: is the news going to report every single death which include a majority of elderly people each day death by death? many have cancer or asthma or weak immune systems or underlying health issues and many may be on respirators in assisted living or hospitals so how do we know the real cause of death? smokers who harmed their lungs. rx’s that damaged lungs and organs such as the heart. every person is different. the news or government doesn’t report the 109 americans who die everyday or the 660,000 deaths of individuals from cancer each year. how about the 47,000 plus individual deaths by suicide and illicit drugs? how long is the scare mongering going to linger on? will be it be until july or august or longer? viruses and diseases are always popping up…influenza, asian influenza 1950’s, hong kong flue 1960’s, meningitis, aids, mers, sars, swine flu, ebola…..we don’t know what else may have contributed to the death. just sayin’. of course the state should not in any way ban or try and interfere with such reporting, whether it is crass, hysterical, or sober. at least in the west the media is covering this outbreak heavily, whereas in china, as appears to be the case, people who blew the whistle on what was going on have been punished or just disappeared. facebook twitter reddit tumblr email march 17th, 2020 | 71 comments and robbers natalie solent (essex) · self defence & security · uk affairs the games of children, we are told, enable them to learn about how the adult world works and practise its ways. in my childhood we played a game called “cops and robbers”. in our innocence we thought we were imitating the grown ups. perhaps we were, in the 1970s. but in 2020 the grown up coppers have tired of that game and gone off to do something else. the times reports, boots makes legal history after police let thief go it was no surprise to anyone who knew nicholas richards, a career criminal with 25 convictions including 18 for shoplifting, that his motives were not entirely honourable when he walked into boots. witnesses described him stealing £170-worth of gucci perfume; cctv footage recovered from the chemist’s flagship branch in piccadilly showed him putting the goods in his bag; and cameras worn by private security officers who detained him recorded him admitting the offence. so staff at boots, which loses between £10,000 and £12,000 a week to shoplifting, were upset when police officers arrived on the crime scene, decided the case was a “civil” matter and released richards, who was already on a suspended sentence for theft. boots was furious about the failure to dispense justice and decided to take part in what is believed to be the first private prosecution for shoplifting supported by a corporate victim. the case is being brought by tm eye. set up by two former metropolitan police officers, it is the parent company of my local bobby (mlb), which provides neighbourhood policing to residents, firms and shops. its 30 “bobbies”, who wear red vests and caps, provide 24-hour cover. they are mostly former police officers and soldiers. richards has pleaded guilty, so it all seems to have worked out all right in the end. this time. this is the nice version of what happens when the state justice system fails and private individuals must step in to fill the void. there is also a less nice version. facebook twitter reddit tumblr email march 15th, 2020 | 29 comments who is dr. li wenliang?

and why do they have to be 3d printed? that’s what ignorami like me want to know. the anonymous writer of the report accordingly begins it thus: magnetic materials are an important component of mechatronic devices such as wind power stations, electric motors, sensors and magnetic switch systems. magnets are usually produced using rare earths and conventional manufacturing methods. … a bit later he says: permanent magnets are incorporated into a number of mechatronic applications. traditional manufacturing methods such as sintering or injection moulding are not always able to cope with increasing miniaturisation and the resulting geometric requirements for magnets, and this is a trend which is sent to continue in the future. additive manufacturing processes offer the necessary freedom of design. … i had to look up sintering. blog and learn. → continue reading: thoughts provoked by some 3d printed miniature magnets facebook twitter reddit tumblr email march 13th, 2020 | 23 comments if only the italian government had not so much else to do and can defer none of it niall kilmartin (stirling) · administrative to add to the burden, hospitals in italy depend on medical personnel to try to trace the contacts that people who test positive have had with others. one doctor in bologna, who asked not to be named, said he had spent a 12-hour day tracing people who had been in contact with just one positive patient, to ensure those who next need testing are found. (from this interesting comparison of italy with south korea, h/t instapundit.) how very sad that italy evidently lacks any pool of state employees whose ordinary tasks could be deferred or done with fewer people, so they could be used to trace contacts while doctors treated patients. how very fortunate that in the uk, we have an overstaffed bureaucracy in many offices of the administration. as doctors will be very busy in coming months on tasks that need their skills, and police busy enough (to defer policing speech? – if only!) and the army perhaps busy if new facilities must be quickly built, the government should immediately give itself the power to allocate up to half the bureaucrats in any state office to the task of tracing the contacts of the infected, requiring the others to step up as needed to keep any essential tasks going (some offices of course, like cruise liners, could go into mothballs pro tem). i despise pc talking heads who demonstrate (yet again) that they see a crisis as just a terrible thing to waste, so would not wish us to imitate them. does anyone see a problem with my suggestion, considered strictly as a way of addressing the upcoming issue better than italy has?
