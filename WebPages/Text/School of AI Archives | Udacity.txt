last week, we launched the intro to machine learning with tensorflow nanodegree program. after this launch, our learners can now choose between pytorch and tensorflow frameworks of deep learning. in order to understand the industry uptake of this emerging technology, we connected with some of our alumni of the intro to machine learning with pytorch nanodegree program. here’s what they said about the impact of the nanodegree program on their lives. continue reading school of ai, student success from a web developer to a machine learning engineer | student story start learning post the launch of our all-new intro to machine learning with tensorflow nanodegree program, we spoke to one of our graduates from the intro to machine learning with pytorch nanodegree program, who is now a machine learning engineer, to check how the program helped him redefine his career. “today i work as a machine learning engineer, it’s like a dream come true,” chuckles the very excited omkar sahasrabudhe. omkar moved from being an intern to a web developer and now a machine learning engineer in just a little over a year. this is his story. continue reading announcements, artificial intelligence, featured blogs, school of ai introducing the intro to machine learning with tensorflow nanodegree program start learning the field of machine learning continues to boast incredible job growth, salaries, and skill sets that can be used in many different industries. google utilizes this technology in their cloud product to allow startups to build machine learning models that work on data of any size, while ge utilizes iot to help detect and prevent anomalies and crashes in their products. these are just a snapshot of the numerous applications of machine learning in the market today that display the potential for an exponential amount of professional expansion. currently, just in the us alone, there are over 50,000 open roles for machine learning professionals, so now is the time to develop machine learning expertise! in linkedin’s 2020 emerging jobs report, ai specialist, a role that includes machine learning, deep learning, tensorflow, and python as key skills, boasts 74% annual growth. all of the above skills are incorporated into udacity’s new intro to machine learning with tensorflow nanodegree program, which is a great way to get introduced to the fundamentals of machine learning, including areas like manipulating data, supervised & unsupervised learning, and deep learning. so what is tensorflow, and how is it being utilized today? tensorflow is a deep learning framework made by google for creating machine learning (ml) models that use multi-layer neural networks. the tensorflow library allows users to perform functions by creating computational graphs. airbnb utilizes tensorflow to improve the guest experience to categorize listing photos by classifying images and detecting objects at scale. coca-cola uses tensorflow to enable mobile proof-of-purchase at scale, while paypal uses tensorflow to detect fraud, and twitter uses tensorflow to rank tweets, highlighting the broad and powerful range of applications. continue reading school

across many inspiring stories of our students succeeding in various fields. some make us happy, some make us proud, and then there are some that are so remarkable they make us realize the profound impact our students can have on society. we came across one such story recently of mateusz zatylny, a recipient of the udacity pytorch scholarship and the udacity facebook secure and private ai scholarship, who is now building an autonomous technology driven wheelchair along with a group of udacians he met during the pytorch scholarship program. mateusz is a patient of generalized dystonia, a movement disorder that is not limited to a single part of the body. but that clearly didn’t deter him from achieving great things. he can’t control his wheelchair by himself, so he decided to build an autonomous technology driven wheelchair that could help him and many more to safely maneuver through daily life. continue reading career guidance, school of ai jobs in ai: what they involve and how
