introduce the newest addition to our school of business: the product manager nanodegree program. product management has become one of the hottest career fields today. from mba graduates to former entrepreneurs, the product manager position is a role in the tech industry coveted by some of the boldest and brightest. over the past decade, interest in the product management profession has grown by 300%; and rightfully so. rated as a top 15 job on linkedin’s 2020 emerging jobs report, product managers boast a 24% job growth rate and an national average base salary of $125,000 a year. as alex king, product manager nanodegree program instructor and product manager at uber, states, the product manager role entails high responsibility and reward. “product managers play a critical role in making sure that the right product gets built. this starts by deeply understanding your users and the problems that you are solving for, then working with a number of different teams to identify and build a solution. after launching a product, it’s an amazing feeling when you see people using your product in the real world.” this nanodegree program is great for those looking to break into the product management space, and has no technical prerequisites, so it’s accessible to learners from a variety of backgrounds. once you learn the foundational skills required in product management, you will be equipped to further specialize your skillset with the ai product manager nanodegree program, as well as the growth and data product manager nanodegree programs coming soon. product managers drive company and customer value let’s go through a few examples of why product managers are so valuable to companies. have you heard of icq? most likely not. however, most of you probably have used or at least heard of aol’s instant messenger. icq was an early messenger tool similar to aol’s instant messenger, but unlike instant messenger, icq had too many features that struggled to deliver customer value; as a result, it never took off because it became too overwhelming and inadequate for users. now, let’s examine an example that is a little more recent. when apple released its first version of the ipod in 2001, microsoft released a competitive offering five years later called microsoft zune. however, unlike apple’s ipod, microsoft’s zune failed to deliver any additional value to listeners and was late to the market, resulting in listeners sticking with apple’s ipod instead of switching over to microsoft’s zune, causing microsoft to discontinue production of the zune product after a few years. so what distinguishes exciting ideas from industry-changing innovations? a product manager. product managers make visions a reality by tactfully blending insight-driven strategy with influential execution. whether it’s adding a feature that enhances customer delight for an existing product, such as in aol’s instant messenger, or a completely new offering into the market, such as apple’s ipod, product managers serve as the bridge between what problems a company spends their resources solving and the value that gets delivered to the company’s customers. moreover, with the rise of digitization in the past few decades, all companies, including ones that were previously primarily selling physical products, such as nike, procter & gamble, and lego, now need product managers that can guide the development of software products. as a mckinsey article states, product managers are critical for companies in today’s digital era, connecting software-engineering teams to the rest of the organization, and ensuring resources spent internally create extraordinary customer value externally. such an influential role requires a dynamic set of skills, including mastery of both soft skills, such as influencing without authority, and hard skills, such as distilling customer and market-based insights into a product spec. being able to apply this breadth of skills throughout the product development lifecycle is what allows impactful products to be delivered into the market at the right time with the right features. there is a product management skill gap in the market due to a lack of industry-relevant programs that focus on both the soft and hard skills however, this dynamic set of skills that set product managers apart are a rare breed in the workforce, especially in countries like australia and india. the gap of skilled product managers in the workforce can be attributed to the lack of practical, industry-relevant training. mckinsey claims the maturity of a product manager can be measured across six pillars, and that the best way to upskill in these pillars is through working on real-world projects with regular coaching and feedback. in other words, product managers need to have a good sense of business, tech, and design, and be capable of seeing synergistic opportunities and switching contexts between those three domains constantly. however, there are very few product management training programs available in the market that enable synergistic problem solving across the business, tech, and design domains, and there are even fewer that teach the hard and soft skills needed to work effectively at the intersection of these three spheres. program details the projects in the product manager nanodegree program will prepare you to lead a cross-functional team in your organization, and act as the ceo and general manager of a mini-startup within your company. students who enroll in the product manager nanodegree program will

learning in our previous blog we talked about why do you need google analytics when you have wordpress stats. in this blog, we will talk more about how to add google analytics to wordpress. google analytics offers wordpress users a variety of plugins to choose from. depending on the one you choose, your setup may witness slight differences. common wordpress plugins include monsterinsights, google analytics dashboard for wp, and woocommerce for google analytics. continue reading school of business google analytics for wordpress (part 1) start learning when you create a wordpress website or blog, what’s your primary goal? it’s a no brainer, really – you want to attract as many subscribers and visitors as you possibly can. but what do you want your viewers to do once they’re on your site? why have you brought them there, and how did they get there? which campaigns bring you the most visitors, which web pages do they spend the most time on, and which ones rack up the maximum conversions? unless you track these metrics and work toward bending them in your favor, you’re running blind – and your chances of making it big with your content are about as high as they are of you running into danny ocean and his band of merry thieves. you see, no marketing professional enters the digital marketing game unless they want to make it big. which is why nearly every one of them uses google analytics. google analytics helps you track, measure, and analyze each of the above metrics, and then some. all you need to do is install a google analytics plugin, and you start raking in your data immediately. it’s as simple as that. and the best part? not only is it free, but even the installation, like all things wordpress – is as easy as pie. continue reading school of business content strategy explained start learning in the hyper competitive world that we live in today, the first step to getting an edge over peers is to have a rock-solid, smart content strategy in place. after all, if the google gods don’t know of your existence, who will? still, according to content marketing institute, merely 39% of b2b organizations had a documented content strategy in place as of 2019. see where are we going? that’s a lot of money left on the table, just for lack of a plan. sure, publishing content is a lot about blogging (the most popular activity on the list!), but not only is it a whole lot more beyond that, but it’s also not likely to stick unless it’s based on a plan. that’s why you need a content strategy – one of the most critical components of your overall digital marketing plan. continue reading school of business ux designer salaries user experience design, or ux design, is a job in the tech industry that revolves around creating simple, easy, and fulfilling
