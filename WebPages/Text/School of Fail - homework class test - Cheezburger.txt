could that somehow be manifested as a ghost? it seems like a reasonable assumption — unless you understand basic physics. the answer is very simple, and not at all mysterious. after a person dies, the energy in his or her body goes where all organisms' energy goes after death: into the environment. the energy is released in the form of heat, and transferred into the animals that eat us (i.e., wild animals if we are left unburied, or worms and bacteria if we are interred), and the plants that absorb us. there is no bodily "energy" that survives death to be detected with popular ghost-hunting devices. comments ghosts science funny school of fail favorite just sitting there waiting for a partner share show dropdown tweet stumble pin it email by unknown repost - vote - recaption comments alone dogs funny teachers pair up school of fail favorite this ain't breaking bad share show dropdown tweet stumble pin it email by unknown repost - vote - recaption comments breaking bad crystal meth teacher walter white parenting favorite sorry, mom share show dropdown tweet stumble pin it email via davetay1021 repost - vote - recaption comments school yearbook parenting mom school of fail favorite the history of time & everything share show dropdown tweet stumble pin it email by unknown repost - vote - recaption comments history funny infographics time g rated school of fail school of fail favorite but how else will you know it's me?
