mr. marsh!!!” a tsunami of six-year old children surges towards me. “he’s got the bloody costume on the wrong way round,” i hear one of the teaching assistants hiss. “oh god – look where the tail…” her words are lost as i am engulfed. i feel arms grabbing my legs and bodies swarming around my back, attempting to hug the bear. several pairs of hands are clawing away at the bear head, trying to pull it off. i can dimly hear the teacher appealing for calm, but now every bit of me is being pushed and pulled in some sort of bezerker frenzy. the mums are pointing and hooting away and using their phones to take photographs. “he’s hungry! the bear is hungry!” a child starts force-feeding the bear, stuffing leaves and twigs into its mouth. this is where my eye-hole is, so i am now completely blind. a small hand thrusts up inside the bear head itself and gives me a fat lip. something, presumably a child, is clinging on so hard to my left leg that i am in danger of falling. i can hear goldilocks and the teacher trying to restore order. but the children are in a bear-baiting world of their own. i make pathetic ‘please be kind to the bear’ noises, but to no avail. they are not giving up. i remove the bear head in defeat, blinking in the sunshine, sweat pouring down my face. “yay!!! mr. marsh!!!” my act of submission appears to satisfy the children. when calm finally descends, i put on the bear head once more, in order to take part in the activity. it involves me standing under a tree in a bear costume. in my paws i hold a basket, in which are the ingredients for porridge. the children seem to enjoy their activity, and my role is concluded. i plod back across the playground and through the school. i change out of the bear costume. later, i am given an evaluation form for the session. the first question reads: ‘please state whether the event met your expectations.’ you can buy my latest book on amazon (and in all good bookstores).
