(comments are closed) coppers. friends or foes? scott wickstein (adelaide, australia) · opinions on liberty in the daily telegraph, simon heffer gets stuck right into police forces, and especially the constabulary of kent, for various offences against liberty and common sense. it is a rather populist article, designed to stir the pot, but i think it is a pot worth stirring. i myself on the other end of the world share his disdain for my local police force, which i regard as nothing more or less then the armed enforcers of the treasury department. i certainly have reservations about their ethics, methods, and purpose, and i suspect much worse of them. given that the head of australian federal police is trying to push for a media blackout of its anti-terrorist activities, a power that could easily be abused, i think i have good reasons to fear the worst from the boys in blue. how did it come to this? my own guess is that police forces are just reflecting the nature of the governments that supposedly control them. monkey see, monkey do. january 30th, 2008 | 17 comments - (comments are closed) that is one small step for man, one giant leap for private enterprise scott wickstein (adelaide, australia) · aerospace & astronautics with all the attention being on new private initiatives in space travel hogging the headlines, it is worth noting that there is the real prospect of a new space race taking place between china and the united states, with china planning an eventual lunar landing as a prelude to a mission to mars. there would be plenty of people who would welcome such a development, but i am not one of them. as i see it, there is a legitimate role for government funded space programs, but there must be a sensible trade-off between costs and benefits. the voyager space probes were sensible investments that produced wonderful results; the apollo program, for all the hype, was not something that was worth the immense cost. i say this because the way that technology is developing, private ventures are expanding in their capabilities quite quickly, and they are much more suitable enterprises to carry the torch of humanity into space. the original space race between the usa and the ussr carried awfully nationalistic and ideological connotations, and a future race between china and the usa is certainly going to have a stench of nationalism about it. private enterprise ventures have a much greater capacity to bring in international participation. it cannot be denied, of course, that government ventures are capable of achieving far more, and far quicker, then private ones; having the power of the state to extract wealth from its citizenry, and a powerful will, can cause amazing things to happen. the apollo program is a case in point, and so was the manhattan project. that does not mean that they are justifiable. china’s space program is still at a relatively modest stage; they only succeeded in putting an astronaut into orbit in 2003. but if they invested enough money in it, they could progress quite quickly. it is simply a matter of how high that they consider it in their list of priorities. if they give it a high priority they could certainly reach their goals, especially given that chinese taxpayers are not in a position to object. how long is it going to take private explorers to get to do serious space travel? that point is no longer moot. from 2004 the progress of private ventures has been impressive, and if this momentum can be continued, it might well be that the first private entrepreneur on the moon might not be that far behind the chinese and american astronauts. wouldn’t it be wonderful if the first explorer on mars represented a private consortium? january 30th, 2008 | 25 comments - (comments are closed) the bail bondsman scott wickstein (adelaide, australia) · north american affairs american readers will no doubt be familiar with the long standing trade of the bail bond companies. non-american readers may not be so familiar with the system, in which private companies post bail for defendants in return for a fee. it is a process which is not allowed in most other countries, but it seems that it is a highly effective system in ensuring that defendants appear for their trials. i myself had no idea about the bail bond industry until i read this article about it in the new york times. the american bar association hates the practice, it seems, and given the grip of lawyers in other legal systems, it is very unlikely that the practice will be emulated elsewhere. which is a pity; some of these american innovations have a lot going for them. january 29th, 2008 | 31 comments - (comments are closed) these kids these days… scott wickstein (adelaide, australia) · arts & entertainment · children's issues a long time ago, when i was a wee nip of a lad, my parents would keep me quiet by turning on the television and having me watch such classics as sesame street. little did they know that what i was watching was not suitable for children! i know that now, because the early seasons of sesame street have come out on dvd and they have been given a parental advisory, no less. the first few seasons have just been released and come with, of all things, a warning. “these early sesame street episodes are intended for grownups and may not suit the needs of today’s preschool child,” the warning reads. “sesame was created in the ’60s, and it was a bit edgier, if you will,” said sherrie rollins westin, executive vice president of sesame workshop. what parent today would want their child to see kids running through a construction site or jumping on an old box spring? scenes like the ones included on the new dvd would probably not make it into today’s program now. “we wouldn’t have children on the set riding without a bicycle helmet,” rollins westin says. and what’s that little girl doing with that man? “in the very first episode, gordon takes a little girl’s hand who he’s just met on the street, befriends her and takes her into his home to give her ice cream,” rollins westin said. “that’s something we wouldn’t do on the show today.” and rightly so. you wouldn’t want your kids to turn out like us dreadful generation x old fogeys, after all! january 27th, 2008 | 42 comments - (comments are closed) a military coup in australia scott wickstein (adelaide, australia) · aus/nz affairs · historical views · military affairs it is not widely known even in australia that in 1808 the nsw corps of the british army deposed the governor of new south wales, william bligh, in a coup. this is known as the ‘rum rebellion’, but it was not really about rum. reading about it on wikipedia, it is clear that governor bligh, a captain in the royal navy, who had already endured the mutiny on the bounty, was not fit to govern a colony like new south wales was at the start of the 19th century. for there were already free settlers in new south wales at that time, and they wanted their rights and liberties as british subjects respected. chief among them was john macarthur. michael duffy writes about the rebellion and macarthur’s role in it here. as for myself, since it is also australia day today, i am going to do the patriotic thing and toast my nation onwards- with good old australian rum. january 26th, 2008 | 10 comments - (comments are closed) disturbing allegations scott wickstein (adelaide, australia) · middle east & islamic · north american affairs in 2004 in this space, gabriel syme noted some disturbing revelations from an fbi translater, sibel edmonds. it turns out that edmonds had, in fact, plenty more to say, but had kept her own counsel. until now. a whistleblower has made a series of extraordinary claims about how corrupt government officials allowed pakistan and other states to steal nuclear weapons secrets. sibel edmonds, a 37-year-old former turkish language translator for the fbi, listened into hundreds of sensitive intercepted conversations while based at the agency’s washington field office. she approached the sunday times last month after reading about an al-qaeda terrorist who had revealed his role in training some of the 9/11 hijackers while he was in turkey. edmonds described how foreign intelligence agents had enlisted the support of us officials to acquire a network of moles in sensitive military and nuclear institutions. among the hours of covert tape recordings, she says she heard evidence that one well-known senior official in the us state department was being paid by turkish agents in washington who were selling the information on to black market buyers, including pakistan. the allegations, to say the least, are explosive. the fbi has denied everything, as you might expect. but a disturbing picture is emerging, and given the fairly dodgy reputation of american government officials to start with, it is not hard to believe that edmonds, if anything, understates the scale of the dirty dealings going on between the united states and various regimes. january 25th, 2008 | 11 comments - (comments are closed) to the stocks! scott wickstein (adelaide, australia) · economics, business & globalization equity investors are having a rough time at the moment. all of asia’s major stock markets plummeted on tuesday morning, continuing a bloodbath in share prices that saw london’s ftse 100 suffer its biggest one-day fall since the 9/11 terror attacks as fears of a worldwide recession gripped the markets. i wonder what brought that on? could it be that the lack of easy money going through the financial system will finally impact on company earnings? i have no idea; i don’t work in the industry. but with the bears rampant, it will be interesting and worrying to see our political lords and masters promise ‘interventions’ to ‘stabilise’ the market. good luck with that! january 22nd, 2008 | 12 comments -
