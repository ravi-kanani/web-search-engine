in my case, my friends and my parents know about the blog. my parents heard about it the first time when i’d gotten invited to brighton, uk, by arenanet. but i never actually told them the url. since their english isn’t that good anyway, they wouldn’t be able to read it and my father would most certainly not be interested in reading any of it. some friends know the blog, but i don’t think many read it… but here it is: i am very careful about who gets the url (and thus, my internet name) and who doesn’t. only my geeky friends are allowed in. the others sometimes don’t even know i play video games or i’ve just mentioned it without going into any details. number 7 (trying to come up with ideas for your blog) and 8 (freaking out when you have an idea and can’t write fast enough) in her list are certainly issues i’ve been struggling with more often than not. and last but not least, her number 11: you have lots of fun! – yes, thankfully. because if you don’t, you should seriously ask yourself why you’re still blogging if it isn’t for the fun! now, on to the second part of this blog post, the fictional gift i give to luana: i know, i know, you’re not supposed to gift pets. that’s a bad thing to do as animals need a lot of care and it has to be a conscious decision for said pet by the future owner. however, it’s a fictional pet, so let me get away with it just once! my gift is a pocket dragon! – i read she doesn’t have a basement, so i assume there is no dungeon either and no castle with little towers for the dragon to curl around on. a pocket dragon it is then. it’s a dragon because – well, i assume luana likes dragons. also, it’s small, so it can go with her everywhere as it can hide in pockets. hence, the name after all. and if somebody asks for fire so they can light up a cigarette, it’s got you covered. and his name is ferdinand. although i’m not sure he listens to any name at all. he’s a bit stubborn, you see? but still, it is his name, after all. so, go on and name it whatever you want if you don’t like ferdinand. just don’t let him know you renamed him and you should be fine. share this: click to share on twitter (opens in new window) click to share on facebook (opens in new window) click to email this to a friend (opens in new window) click to share on whatsapp (opens in new window) click to share on pocket (opens in new window) more click to share on telegram (opens in new window) click to share on linkedin (opens in new window) click to print (opens in new window) click to share on reddit (opens in new window) click to share on pinterest (opens in new window) click to share on skype (opens in new window) click to share on tumblr (opens in new window) like this: like loading... related categories: community other blogs/websites published by paeroka view all posts by paeroka tags: blogging community, secret blogger santa post navigation previous my top mmos in 2019 next my top games i discovered in 2019 3 comments naithin says: 25 dec 2019 at 14:13 “i am very careful about who gets the url (and thus, my internet name) and who doesn’t. only my geeky friends are allowed in. the others sometimes don’t even know i play video games or i’ve just mentioned it without going into any details.” that’s pretty much my handle on it too. i keep a fairly clear separation between most of my rl and online (past the borders of facebook). only those already in my gaming circle or close to it get to bridge the gap between the two. great post, and merry christmas, p! hope you have a great break. :) likeliked by 1 person reply luana @bookstormgirl says: 25 dec 2019 at 19:26 can i just say… this is the most fitting gift ever, and i love ferdinand 😂 thank you so much for this post! it was really fun, and i can now shove ender’s game in your face to make you read it. i mean… something along those lines, but nicer 😁 merry christmas!! likelike reply pingback: geeky giftening – a secret blogger santa – bookstormgirl what do you think?
