(dryden returned to scudéry's ibrahim for inspiration for another play, an evening's love, the following year, 1668 — though that venture proved much less successful.) dryden also borrowed material from shirley's love in a maze. by dryden's own testimony, the unheroic philocles was inspired by magnus de la garide, the royal favorite of queen christina of sweden. the drama was revived in an adapted form in 1707; colley cibber mixed it with materials from marriage à la mode. the play remained in the repertory throughout the eighteenth century in various forms; a shortened version called celadon and florimel was acted as late as 1796. a london revival of the maiden queen occurred in 1886.[4] references ^ samuel peply's diary, samuel pepys, 2 march 1666, project gutenberg, accessed 12 september 2008 ^ george saintsbury and sir walter scott, eds., the works of john dryden, vol. 2, edinburgh, william paterson, 1882; pp. 414–16 and ff. ^ john downes, roscius anglicanus, london, 1706; montague summers, ed., london, fortune press [no date]; reprinted new york, benjamin blom, 1968; p. 100. ^ downes, pp. 111–12. external links secret-love : or the maiden-queen: as it is acted by his majesties servants at the theater-royal.
