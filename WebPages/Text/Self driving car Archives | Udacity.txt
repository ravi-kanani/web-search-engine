start learning sometime back we highlighted the student story of kush singh, a 9 year old programmer who wants to found companies that can create technology. this week we have another young genius to blow your minds. the 11-year-old self-driving car engineer, aaron ma! to say that he is anything less than the future of technology is an understatement. aaron is already a graduate from udacity’s self driving car engineer nanodegree program, deep reinforcement learning nanodegree program, and ai for trading nanodegree program as the youngest udacity nanodegree graduate. apart from these, he has successfully graduated from more than 50 certificates from various online learning platforms. here’s what aaron has to say: continue reading self driving car, udacity for enterprise, workforce planning and management, workforce transformation mazda partners with udacity to train its future workforce how mazda is defining the self-driving and connected car the auto industry is going through major changes, including stricter environmental and safety regulations, new competitors from other industries, and diversification of the mobility business. self-driving cars are coming; it’s no longer a question if autonomous vehicles will hit the market but when they’ll become available. yet, for mazda, its taking autonomy and using it “to excite the drive in other ways,” rather than just building another personal shuttle bus. mazda is one of a few automakers without any grandiose plans for autonomous cars quite yet, but the company recently commissioned a study to better understand how drivers feel about them. it found more than two-thirds have no interest in letting an autonomous car drive them around. mazda’s conclusion from the research is that autonomous tech should serve as more of a “the mazda co-pilot concept” and keep the human in command at all times. for mazda, like other automotive manufacturers, the future is being defined by the connected car. “cars will soon start streaming data out to the cloud: data that we’ll be able to access and take action on, data that tells us in specific terms what’s going on with an individual vehicle and enable us to have personalized conversation with the vehicle owner,” says shuji watanabe. “we’ll have data on everything from fault codes to oil health. if we can tap into that data, it could be the start of a conversation with the customer that gives them a better overall experience of owning a mazda.” the company has placed a heavy emphasis on training and development of their global workforce. they are harnessing the power of training not only by increasing access to job retraining for their employees but empowering their lower-skilled workers to continuously “upskill” on the job. “prior technology transformations in the workforce have taken place across generations. we are currently experiencing intra-generational job disruption, where the job you trained for at age 20 may not exist at age 40. so now we need to retrain workers mid-career.” in partnership with udacity, mazda initiated its technical research and product development teams to participate in the self-driving car engineer nanodegree program in 2018. the self-driving car engineer (sdc) nanodegree program is an advanced program in which employees develop an algorithm and write programs in python and c++, and learn new frameworks like ros and tensorflow. employees entering sdc should be able to write programs from scratch, and should be comfortable with both calculus and linear algebra. sdc does not require solving differential equations by hand, but does require that employees be comfortable interpreting mathematical notation and translating it into code. mazda has implemented a human resource development program under which all new employees of production-related divisions are trained for about three years in product development-related divisions. the purpose of this program is to train employees so they become engineers with knowledge and experience ranging from product development to production, propelling their capabilities to develop next-generation products. “our goal at mazda is to ensure our employees are successful and have the right skills to be successful in their work. our personnel development partnership with udacity is unique because it includes our commitment to provide skills training for our employees coupled with our own educational programs and developmental coaching.” to find out more about how udacity for enterprise is helping mazda and other f500 companies, go to
