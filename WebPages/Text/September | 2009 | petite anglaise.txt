petite anglaise september 28, 2009 over and out? filed under: misc — petiteanglaiseparis @ 3:19 pm i got an email from a reader the other day enquiring after my well-being and suddenly realised i hadn’t blogged in over a month. the truth of the matter is that i’m fine – indeed, we all are – but the inclination to blog, which has been on the wane for some time, seems to have finally left me, and, this time, i suspect it might be permanent. when tadpole says something funny or disturbing – such as yesterday, when we were sharing a bath and she confessed she rather likes the taste of her own crottes de nez – i’m no longer overcome by an overwhelming desire to rush to my keyboard and share her words with the world at large. i tend to update my facebook status instead, and i find that eliciting a few brief responses from my friends usually satisfies any cravings i might have for a spot of banter or virtual interaction. for a long time i put this changed state of affairs down to the fact that i was writing for a living; i reasoned that it was normal, really, to want to do something other than write in my spare time. but i’ve been on hiatus, bookwise, since the springtime, and the desire to express myself in the form of lengthy blog posts online hasn’t miraculously returned, so it would seem that wasn’t the real explanation, after all. i read an article a month or so ago about liz jones, a newspaper columnist who has made a living out of sharing every aspect of her personal life, showing little or no regard for the feelings or right to privacy of the partners/lovers/neighbours that she uses for material. it left a nasty taste in my mouth. personal blogging was something i felt the need to do during a short, pivotal period of my life but, as i hope i demonstrated in my memoir, i realised, with hindsight, that particular path was strewn with landmines. i learnt some valuable lessons from the experience and will always be grateful for the doors which opened as a result. but now i’ve moved on. when my publisher asked me to pen a host of first person articles to coincide with the launch of ‘french kissing’, i wasn’t at all keen. none of the pitches i sent, somewhat reluctantly, to various newspapers and magazines were actually commissioned, and while i’m sure this didn’t do sales of the book any good, i felt nothing but relief. by choosing to write a novel, i’d consciously taken a step away from tell-all, first person writing. admittedly, some of the subject matter might have seemed familiar to regular blog readers – single motherhood, expat life in paris, dabbling with online dating – but every scene and every last shred of dialogue was invented. i found it more enjoyable, making use of some of my experiences in a fictional context, once removed from my own life. which is why plugging the novel by writing no-holds-barred pieces about my personal life would have felt like a leap backwards. so. let’s make this official. i’ll post updates here if i have any exciting book-related news – such as the french translation of ‘petite’, which will finally be published in my adoptive country on november 4th – and i’m sure i’ll drop by to upload a photo of the new baby, a month (or less) from now. i’m still on facebook – both in a personal capacity, and as an author – and am in the process of reviving my long neglected twitter account. but, as far as personal blogging is concerned, i’ve turned the page. and it feels good. comments (159) search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
