you tell me. this recipe is incredibly easy, which, as you know, is kind of the only way i do meal prep. e-a-s-y. the sauce can shake up in a jar and the noodles can cook in 2 minutes (serious). and just like that, you have sesame noodles. and said sesame noodles are, in fact, the base of the sesame noodle bowls, so basically you’re done. now it’s just up to you how extra you want to get with your bowl-ing. i went medium effort on my sesame noodle bowls with cucumbers, edamame, sesame-ish chicken, and a sprinkling of sesame seeds, and it was part noodles, part salad, part health bomb, and i loved it. you can debate me on hot vs. cold all day – i will let you win either way because both are amazing. guys, this is a desk lunch to keep you counting the hours till lunch but not like i do that?! happy prepped lunches to you! check out our video for how to make sesame noodle bowls (1 min): 15 minute meal prep: sesame noodle bowls ★★★★★ 4.8 from 28 reviews author: lindsay prep time: 10 minutes cook time: 5 minutes total time: 15 minutes yield: 4 bowls 1x print recipe pin recipe description meal prep sesame noodle bowls! fork-twirly noodles, an easy creamy sesame sauce, perfect browned chicken, and all the veg. yum. scale 1x2x3x ingredients sesame sauce: 1/4 cup sesame paste (or tahini) 1/4 cup warm water 3 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 1 clove garlic, grated sriracha and sugar to taste bowls: 6–8 ounces stir fry noodles, chinese egg noodles, or linguine in a pinch 2 cups edamame, cooked 2 cucumbers, diced 1 lb. chicken breast, cooked and diced (optional: see notes) sesame seeds instructions sauce: whisk all sauce ingredients together until smooth (or you can run it through the food processor, or shake it up in a jar). noodles: cook noodles a few minutes less than package instructions. if your noodles seem very sticky, rinse them in cold water. toss noodles with about half of the sesame sauce. bowls: divide noodles, edamame, cucumber, and chicken into containers. drizzle with a little extra sauce and sprinkle with sesame seeds. voila! store in the fridge for 3-4 days. eat hot or cold. take a shot for the ‘gram cause this is your moment. equipment meal prep containers buy now → notes the equipment section above contains an affiliate link to a product we use and love! if you love sauce: make a 1.5x batch. especially if you are going to use some on the chicken. or want some leftover in your fridge or freezer. ideal method for cooking the chicken: cut a pound of chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces, toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. done. if you like a little browning on your chicken (like what’s pictured here), once it’s baked, just pop it in a skillet with some extra sesame sauce and let it get nice and roasty-browned on the outside! noodles: the noodles i used said “oriental style noodles – product of japan” on the package, but a lot of the videos i watched for sesame noodles recommended chinese egg noodles. whatever noodles you use, i’d recommend cooking for slightly less than what is directed on the package. soy sauce: a lot of recipes i saw called for dark soy sauce! i liked using dark soy sauce and probably would do that again, but i also found that the sauce still tasted really good with regular or low sodium soy sauce. in my opinion, either one can work. hot / cold: if you do want to eat these sesame noodles hot, i would recommend storing the cucumber separately and adding it after you heat it up. other vegetables / proteins: cucumbers are traditional with sesame noodles, but i think just about any vegetables (and/or protein) would be great. carrots. bell peppers. broccoli. green onions. shrimp. salmon. tofu. tempeh. peanuts. category: lunch method: mix cuisine: asian-inspired did you make this recipe?

i am looking for a lower carb option! thanks! 02/21/19 @ 11:28 am reply website design company in kolkata that noodles recipe i love it. but i like with tomato and bins are awesome ★★★★★ 02/23/19 @ 11:05 am reply allison i made this with whole wheat spaghetti and it was great! 08/01/19 @ 9:59 am reply linger i love easy, i love healthy and i love yummy!! this recipe delivers on all three. what a great dish for any time of the day. thanks for sharing!! ★★★★★ 02/21/19 @ 11:35 am reply carrie can’t wait to make this! do you have a brand of ‘stir fry’ noodles you can recommend? are they fresh or dry? 02/21/19 @ 11:37 am reply dnn beautifully portion-sized meal lindsay. since i’ve been cooking more home meals recently, i don’t have the urge like i used to to eat at hibachi restaurants and gulp down large meals at once. thank you for this blog. 🙂 02/21/19 @ 11:40 am reply cassie autumn tran the sesame sauce sounds absolutely to die for. i would love to try it with zucchini noodles, chickpea pasta, or black bean pasta someday along with air-fried tofu and my favorite vegetables for dinner! woot woot–can’t wait! 02/21/19 @ 11:52 am reply jenna @ pinch of yum that sounds amazing! 02/22/19 @ 3:27 pm reply website design company in kolkata really great words. ★★★★★ 02/23/19 @ 11:08 am reply linda rinsing noodles in cold water defeats your purpose — as it prevents the sauce from clinging to the noodles. loosen the noodles using a small amount of sauce…. 02/21/19 @ 12:04 pm reply dnn i never knew that, linda. thanks for letting us know. 🙂 02/23/19 @ 6:29 am reply allison yay something with no peanut butter in it! 🙂 🙂 🙂 this sounds delicious – can’t wait to try. 02/21/19 @ 2:01 pm reply jenna @ pinch of yum hope you enjoy it! 02/22/19 @ 3:23 pm reply allison this was super yum and so easy! 05/08/19 @ 10:23 am reply cynthia i am loving your quick (but healthy) weeknight meal recipes lately! i’ve tried a couple of your recent ones and am definitely here for them. thanks for sharing & looking forward to what you have in store 🙂 02/22/19 @ 5:11 am reply liza porper i made this last night and it was delicious! my husband really loved it as well. thanks for a great recipe and super easy and quick to make. this will definitely make it into our weekly rotation. ★★★★★ 02/22/19 @ 9:29 am reply jenna @ pinch of yum glad you enjoyed it, liza! 02/22/19 @ 3:19 pm reply beth johns i made this sauce up as soon as i read it! i did use the dark soy sauce and tahini. i added 1/4 tsp sriracha and 1/2 tsp. sugar. seemed lacking a bit of something for me, but it was good. i made it using rice noodles. next time i will make it with a thick, sweet soy sauce and sesame paste. hoping that will give a bit deeper flavor profile. loved how easy it was to make!! ★★★★★ 02/22/19 @ 10:21 am reply jenna @ pinch of yum glad to hear it, beth! 02/22/19 @ 3:18 pm reply kim ryan make this quick and easy recipe for dinner tonight and it was yummy. i had everything except the tahini, so i just subbed crunchy peanut butter. i doubled the sauce and added broccoli. other than the tahini and broccoli i followed recipe. ★★★★★ 02/22/19 @ 6:33 pm reply ilias azrhari i think the recipe looks very good. and that it is also very healthy because it contains only 395 calories and only 23% fat. i like that after the recipe you also give tips on how to make it the best. i also like that for some ingredients you give other possibilities because i don’t really like sesame seeds. what is also very nice is that the preparation of this only takes 15 minutes. i appreciate your hard work really hard for sharing the recipe with others so they can see and hopefully make it. i want to thank you for the recipe and wish you all the best. ★★★★ 02/24/19 @ 3:59 am reply lia would marinating tofu in the sesame sauce also work? i want a good vegetarian recipe so i’m thinking that could work but i’m not sure 02/24/19 @ 1:45 pm reply jenna @ pinch of yum yes! that would work great. 02/25/19 @ 3:34 pm reply melissa bullock can’t wait to try this! i’m just a little confused about the calculated protein in the nutrition facts. 1 pound of chicken is about 100g of protein and this is 4 servings. so it would be about 25g of protein per serving, not 8g. thank you for posting this recipe!! 07/13/19 @ 4:30 pm reply cat this sounds so tasty! thoughts on serving it cold as a cold noodle salad? i think it’ll be scrumptious! 02/24/19 @ 8:17 pm reply jenna @ pinch of yum definitely! 02/25/19 @ 3:29 pm reply beth lewis how do you think soba noodles would work in this dish? 02/24/19 @ 8:54 pm reply heather watkins just meal-prepped this for lunches this week. i used tofu which i pan-fried after watching how to pan-fry it on the website. it was quite delicious! i forgot about using dark soya sauce and i wish i would have tried that. i found the sesame sauce not quite as flavourful as i would have liked, so shall play around a bit. all in all a great meal for lunch for the hubs and i. 02/25/19 @ 2:54 pm reply jenna @ pinch of yum glad to hear it, heather! 02/25/19 @ 3:10 pm reply ginny loved this dish! added carrots and green onions. wonder how the sauce might be with peanut butter instead of tahini. ★★★★★ 02/26/19 @ 3:15 pm reply zinnat thanks for this wonderful recipe. i am inspired. ★★★★★ 02/26/19 @ 11:50 pm reply vashu your recipe is fantastic i never knew that, linda. thanks for letting us know. 02/27/19 @ 5:00 am reply tara this would be so perfect for lunch! i am a sucker for asian bowls and this looks so delicious. 02/27/19 @ 8:18 am reply jenna @ pinch of yum hope you enjoy it, tara! 03/01/19 @ 2:53 pm reply maggie made for dinner tonight, delish! used whole wheat thin spaghetti, what was on hand, great recipe, easy & delicious! ★★★★★ 02/27/19 @ 8:08 pm reply jenna @ pinch of yum glad you enjoyed it, maggie! 03/01/19 @ 2:49 pm reply emily so excited for this recipe! a handful of pinch of yum recipes have become staples in our house. (i need to start tagging for insta). my husband and i always laugh that when our now toddler is in school and has friends over for dinner they will be so surprised to see curry or a spring roll bowl for dinner rather than chicken fingers! ★★★★★ 03/01/19 @ 10:26 am reply felicity what is sriracha? is there a substitute? 03/01/19 @ 9:51 pm reply tim looking at the picture, i would’ve never thought that this recipe can be made with so little ingredients on hand. i couldn’t believe that i had all ingredients on hand, so i made this for dinner and it was mouthwatering. thank’s for the inspiration! ★★★★★ 03/02/19 @ 1:19 pm reply katie i have made so many recipes from the site and they have all turned out delicious! my all time favorite is the spicy soba noodle salad and the 15 minute lo mein. i made this recipe the other day while my daughter napped….i have to say it took much much longer than 15 minutes. by the time i cut the chicken, boiled and cooked the noodles, made the sauce, my daughter was up. it took almost an hour! it was pretty tasty but i’ll stick to the soba noodles and lo mein. ★★★ 03/03/19 @ 9:01 pm reply newer comments » hey! nice to meet you! i'm lindsay: former 4th grade teacher, now full time blogger. my husband bjork and i live in minnesota. favorite things include my camera, lake days, and dark chocolate. learn more. popular posts dessert the best soft chocolate chip cookies quick and easy the best avocado egg salad recipes slow cooker chicken pot pie soup quick and easy miracle no knead bread blogging tips delivered straight to your inbox blogger resources top posts 1 avoiding blog burnout2 blogging as a couple3 building a blog while traveling4 how to start a food blog5 creating an income6 tools bloggers shouldn't live without7 photography tips start, grow, and monetize your food blog. join today. how’s this for awesome? get all of my best recipes sent to you for free! sign up to receive a free ecookbook with my top 25 most popular recipes. pinch of yum about our team sponsored content media mentions contact food & recipes blog shop recipe index sugar free january freezer meals 101 for bloggers income reports blogging resources photography resources tasty food photography sign up for email updates and get a free ecookbook with our top 25 recipes. our other brands pinch of yum copyright © 2020 an elite cafemedia food publisher back to top • privacy policy x pinch of yum a food blog with simple, tasty, and (mostly) healthy recipes. follow on pinterest
