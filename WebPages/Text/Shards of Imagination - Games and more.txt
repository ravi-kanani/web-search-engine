february 20, 2020february 20, 2020 by rakuno last night i completed one of the games that have been in my bucket list for a long time, the witcher. just so you have an idea of how long i have been trying to finish this game, i bought it when it was a new release, way before the whole enhanced edition even existed. the main reason it took me this long to finish this game is because the combat is, well, clunky. this would always annoy me to the point that i‚Äôd eventually stop then get distracted by another game and completely forget about the witcher. read morethe witcher finished! categories single player tags the witcher [fgo] my first 5* servant and my history with them february 17, 2020february 17, 2020 by rakuno a while ago i found this thread on the fate grand order forums at gamepress. it is pretty much what it says on the title, a thread where people can talk how they got their first 5 stars servant in the game and how it has been since then. since it is an interesting thread, i thought i‚Äôd copy my post there over here. enjoy!

they were mostly before i got sucked back into monster hunter world, but still, they are something else that i can talk about! read moregames i‚Äôve been playing ‚Äì january 2020 categories about rakuno tags civilization vi, fate grand order, fgo, games i've been playing, mhw, monster hunter world, the witcher, uncharted 2 comments bingeing on monster hunter world january 20, 2020january 20, 2020 by rakuno i didn‚Äôt use to understand why some of my friends played monster hunter world as frequently as they do. sure, i like the game too but i don‚Äôt have the same kind of passion. now after spending the weekend playing the game a bit more i think i am starting to understand the appeal. my whole weekend this time was spent doing optional quests in the game. most of those were high rank from the base game and although i didn‚Äôt have to do them i still wanted to just for completionism‚Äôs sake. it turned out to be a very fun experience too. even with just some starting-level gear from iceborne i was able to just wreck the face of all the monsters in these quests. i honestly don‚Äôt think i ever hunted them so fast by myself. read morebingeing on monster hunter world categories single player tags mhw, mhwib, monster hunter world, monster hunter world iceborne monster hunter world base game story completed! january 14, 2020january 14, 2020 by rakuno finishing the story for the base game of monster hunter world was something that was in my bucket list for a very long time. it was something i struggled to do for such a long time that at certain points i thought about giving up on it completely. thankfully i didn‚Äôt and this weekend i finally completed the base game‚Äôs story! üòÄ it wasn‚Äôt something i was really planning to do, nor actually expecting it. it kinda of just happened. maybe i should back track a little to explain how things turned out like this. i always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with the game. love because hunting giant monsters is fun. hate because the grind to get new gear to hunt new monsters can be tedious. the frustration with the grind only got worse when i got to the high rank monsters and the difficulty spike suddenly felt like it went way up. when i reached nergigante then? it felt like i reached an insurmountable wall i‚Äôd never be able to get past. read moremonster hunter world base game story completed!
