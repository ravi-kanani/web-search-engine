üôÇ reply wayne says: november 3, 2017 at 9:47 am sorry tim this pertains to your 5-bullet friday posts. quite often when i click on something you‚Äôve linked to it comes up service not available? thanks keep cranking out the great content ! reply darlene bamford says: november 3, 2017 at 12:07 pm hi there, appreciate your suggestions every friday. your podcasts and blogs as well. i have two ideas for you- kenkoh sandals: i have zero connection to this company but love these reflexology sandals. neurofeedback: i‚Äôm a retired counsellor & for decades studied/or tried many therapeutic approaches to resolve anxiety/trauma issues. nf has changed my life. all the best tim. reply ryan biddulph says: november 3, 2017 at 12:11 pm that is the essence of meditation tim; as sharon says, do the good that is in front of you. people crave massive platforms to change the world but realize not it is the seemingly tiny acts that help you manifest the big platforms. i gobble up all opportunities to help folks. from commenting on blogs to promoting other bloggers to assisting people through email and quora, i am about the acts of kindness and doling them out whenever i can. meditation helps you see that all of it matters, yet, is no big deal. it is about doing things with love, not fear, and especially doing those seemingly small things with love‚Ä¶..those things folks look past because they are fearful they will not get a return on the act. thanks tim as always. ryan reply niko says: november 3, 2017 at 2:07 pm hi tim, love your books and all the stuff ! so i thought to give you a small suggestion üôÇ i (and many other people) have a problem which is especially troubling when meditating ‚Äì tinnitus. there is very little knowledge about it out there and practically no treatment. if there is someone that could ‚Äúhack‚Äù this really common issue, it‚Äôs probably someone you know. please, think about it a bit, i believe this ‚Äúhack‚Äù would help a great many! best of luck! reply empresario n says: november 5, 2017 at 5:38 pm hello niko ! i have tinnitus too for many years and i do meditate every day, in my experience tinnitus do not bother me (no need for a complete silence if that is the issue ), moreover you could even use the tinnitus sound as your focus or just ‚Äúobserve‚Äù it for a while, the problem may disappear. reply jason says: november 3, 2017 at 2:43 pm this is not related to the episode but i wanted to let you know that i coopted your 5 bullet friday for my classroom. i use a similar format to inform my children‚Äôs parents about what is going on in our second grade classroom. thanks for this really great idea. i appreciate it. reply catherine lehnardt hess says: november 3, 2017 at 3:35 pm tim ferriss! i have such a major crush on you. for years, i‚Äôve been listening to your words, following you online, experimenting with and changing my life because of your influence. i have a proposition: i fly to wherever you are, and you share a bottle of wine with me. deal? thank you for this episode! meditation has played a huge role in who i am today. i love how pleasantly segatious sharon is. thank you for bringing people like her, and their words of wisdom into my life. thank you, tim, for the eloquent and very effective work you do. you are superbly awesome and much appreciated. reply alyonka larionov says: november 4, 2017 at 2:20 am hi tim. love your podcast and most of your guests. it‚Äôs refreshing to hear someone with an immense hunger for curiosity geek out over the intricate roads you can take when questioning, and speaking with, your guests. i write to you from germany while on a three week health detox from american culture, world politics (but specifically u.s. politics), processed foods and ‚Äúorganic‚Äù produce, alcohol (although i‚Äôve been sober for 7 months), social media, technology (aside from a couple of emails), and a total separation from work (i am type a ‚Äì but who isn‚Äôt these days). in this clarity which i‚Äôve found through twice-daily meditation, yoga, walks without earbuds or companionship, strict diet, balanced sleeping schedule, and more or less isolation, i‚Äôve come upon two thoughts. 1.) as a person who experiments with things, this place might be of interest to you. 2.) i‚Äôve often wondered if in my father‚Äôs lifetime there would be a human to properly interview him and dissect his legacy, skill, and really ‚Äòje ne sais quois‚Äô which propelled him to where he is, and i thought of you. perhaps, your genuine curiosity would be something that would intrigue him and would allow him to open up his incredible story to the world. many, many journalists have tried ‚Äì the closest i‚Äôve seen is an attempt by mitch albom which only scratched the surface ‚Äì but something tells me the two of you could make it work. i don‚Äôt know. something to think about. i‚Äôd be happy to make the connect + help facilitate. keep doing you and never shy away from that child-like curiosity. best, alyonka reply craig says: november 4, 2017 at 11:07 am i enjoy the your 5 bullet friday every week and i have almost all your books, except that last one which i will get soon. i have a question unrelated to this post. do you have any new suggestions for an endurance hard surface running shoe? the inov-8 shoes you recommended in the past are no longer made. thanks! reply ariel yablon says: november 4, 2017 at 12:41 pm tim, thanks for this amazing podcast. maybe it is late already, but you might like dan harriss‚Äô* hilarious description of his experience at a long retreat in his book 10% happier. please, interview jack kornfield some day! he is also fun and full of wisdom.. good luck at the retreat. saludos from argentina, ariel reply christopher sharp says: november 4, 2017 at 1:10 pm what a tremendous interview. thank you tim! sharon‚Äôs comments along with your own, with regard to being compassionate with one‚Äôs self in the process of returning from distractions when practising meditation, provided wonderful insight. ‚Äúthe healing is in the return, not in never having wandered to begin with‚Äù. reply n says: november 4, 2017 at 6:34 pm dear tim, i read that the best way to get a hold of you is to leave a comment or tweet you‚Ä¶ seeing as i don‚Äôt have twitter, a comment it is! i wanted to thank you for all the time, energy and effort that you put into adding value to this world. i find it very admirable that you challenge yourself to write and share your/others‚Äô knowledge with people like me vs. focusing your energy on solely monetary gains. your work (at least the pieces that i can make time to explore) have spoken and inspired me as an entrepreneur, mother of 4 children 4 and under, and even as a wife. there have been ideas that i have come across in your content that have caused me to reflect and course correct, that have inspired, that have bridged the gaps that caused divide, and that have made me feel like there are other people ‚Äúin the arena‚Äù as well. so thank you. there is so much that you and your guests offer without a price tag. i wish there were more hours in the day to listen to more podcasts and read more content‚Ä¶ but for the ones i have been able to take in, my life has been touched and i am grateful! reply jim says: november 5, 2017 at 3:03 am tim ‚Äì very good session w/ s. salzberg. what do you know about ayahuasca and the rythmia resort in costa rica. i learned about them by watching a piece (and by ‚Äúpiece‚Äù i mean a well-done sales pitch) titled ‚Äúthe reality of truth.‚Äù i‚Äôm the last guy you‚Äôd think might be interested in ‚Äúplant medicine‚Äù (i.e., drugs), but the reported experiences and impact on one‚Äôs life (if done correctly and under proper supervision) seem pretty appealing. i‚Äôd like to hear what you know about the drug its efficacy. keep up the good work. jim reply john grund says: november 5, 2017 at 6:32 am tim, what an absolute joy it was to hear sharon on your podcast. i have been extremely fortunate to have been on retreat with her. i have also taken classes with her and tara brach through the nalanda institute in nyc. i am so thrilled to see that you have had both of these amazing teachers on your show and how you have presented meditation. you should also look into bringing robert thurman on your show. he presents often with sharon and is a teacher at nalanda along with other world renowned mediation teachers. i too just completed my first long silent retreat(7days) and look forward to you talking more about your experience. i am so grateful for all that you bring to me and so many others. reply maria salzman says: november 5, 2017 at 12:52 pm hi tim, you are my last hope( yes i have been meditating for 20 years, my dad was a communist head in poland (one whom the olimpic champieon run away from)who i run away from when i was 18. i have a business that will help 50% of women in the world, yet i have been told by even business women that i need to stop being naive when investors want to invest and ask for fun. i am uncomfortable with having physical connection with a man that is not my husband and i am not sure if i want to get married and i am pretty sure they are not interested in that. i however feel that my idea is so important to women i am happy to give it anyone who will make it available for women. i have been standing up for values for my entire life( i have been tortured in one country for speaking up against persecution) and feel disgusted how bullied i am by men and women into what feels unethical to me. yes i know it sounds weird, but my life has been even more out there then yours. maria reply empresario n says: november 5, 2017 at 5:46 pm great podcast! meditation, as i see it, is not intendet mainly for relaxation, it is a technique to ‚Äúcontrol the mind‚Äù , that means, to learn to be aware of yourself and to learn to distinguish your ‚Äúthinking‚Äù from your true self. relaxation will eventually appear as a byproduct. reply conor sweetman says: november 6, 2017 at 1:40 am sharon has a great laugh. she seems very playful and wise. reply johnbrancy says: november 6, 2017 at 2:16 am hi tim, this was a great episode. been following you, and your podcast for a few years now. i want to quickly draw your attention to a large project coming up on november 26th 2017. a worldwide meditation through the le ciel foundation ‚Äì ielfoundation.com/world-meditation-map/ ‚Äì please give it a look when you have a free moment and if you would like an introduction to connect to the founders i would be happy to do that. their missions are of high importance. thank you for your service, john reply johnbrancy says: november 6, 2017 at 2:17 am sorry here is the full link: http://www.lecielfoundation.com/world-meditation-map/ reply allison says: november 6, 2017 at 7:36 am hi tim! amazing stuff as usual, just want to thank you for writing your book (and sharing your insights with the world) and the amazing community that you have built. if you ever stopover singapore, please know that you have friends here who are ever ready to bring you around to the local hotspots üòâ reply jerzy says: november 6, 2017 at 1:38 pm concerning meditational titans, what about ole nydhal who established 600+ !!! meditation groups, world-wide starting since 1973!!! currently one of biggest buddhist ( like sharon salzburg ) organization on west.!!! reply emilybrowngs says: november 7, 2017 at 12:01 am very much appreciated. reply tatyana says: november 7, 2017 at 6:11 am just came back from my week long meditation retreat and such a nice surprise! üôÇ love sharon! have been a couple of times to her ims retreat. would be amazing if you could interview the co-founder joseph goldstein üôÇ so much looking forward to your impressions on your retreat!! reply mark rogers says: november 7, 2017 at 9:10 am loving your podcasts! i view mediation as exercise for the brain. since my brain is even more important to running my business than my body, and my brain influences the health of my body, daily meditation is my #1 priority. high recommend jack kornfield and his 10 day retreat. he not part of my regular meditation practice, however one of his books touched me deeply so i did do a 10 day retreat with him. can‚Äôt wait to hear what you think about it. you‚Äôre going to get to experience consciousness like you never have before. reply bryce l says: november 8, 2017 at 7:08 pm this episode was so great! sharon is so down to earth and her laugh had me smiling the whole time i was listening! reply ty nelson says: november 19, 2017 at 10:01 am love this, thanks tim and sharon! reply carlito says: november 21, 2017 at 12:15 pm this was such an amazing post to read. i love seeing how other people are helping the world become a better place. [moderator: additional text and link removed.] reply sarah swamy says: november 29, 2017 at 12:52 pm i really enjoyed your interview with sharon salzberg. in the podcast you mentioned a lot of type a personalities have difficulties with irritability, anger, impatience and i think meditation is an excellent practice to help relieve some of those issues. i was also thinking of ayurveda when you mentioned the issues associated with this personality type. ayurveda offers a way to also relieve these issues through herbs and the types of food we eat. irritability, anger, and impatience are signs of pitta imbalance in the body and you can change that by changing what you eat. ayurveda may be something you want to explore. keep up the great work. i really enjoy your podcasts. reply sanju suresh says: december 11, 2017 at 12:15 am nice one, keep up the good work! reply janky patel says: december 14, 2017 at 9:06 am really enjoyed this episode especially since i recently started getting into meditation as well. you mentioned that you were planning on attending the 10-day meditation retreat in november. have you completed the retreat and what are your thoughts and experiences with the retreat? would love to hear your insight! reply jeff lichty says: february 27, 2018 at 1:24 pm tim your sincere thank you of sharon salzberg literally brought tears to my eyes ‚Äì quite possibly i‚Äôm an overtired undercaffeinated single father ‚Äì regardless, i wanted to leave you my absolute and most sincere thanks for bringing to the world these inspiring insights. you are literally doing life changing work you do. kind regards and wishing you all the best! reply josh says: december 31, 2018 at 1:15 pm for me, this episode was one of the most important episodes you‚Äôve ever done. did you ever follow up with sharon? is there a part 2 in the works? thank you for all of this amazing work and content. reply sofia says: february 17, 2019 at 8:59 am the happiest day in 7 years story is quite compelling and uplifting, and i had a similar experience this past week on valentine‚Äôs day, corny, i know, but the fact is that it‚Äôs true. the more i thought and pondered on the periphery of me, what i was experiencing inside was reaffirming my state of well-being. that the sun was shinning and warming the bodies near me while i enjoyed coffee on an outdoor terrace, i was enjoying sharing this space in time with these other four strangers and that all these factors that we were sharing were synchronizing us for bliss, for delight (i can‚Äôt use the word happiness, it doesn‚Äôt set what was occurring). and i did ask myself: why am i so full of bliss? i‚Äôm certain that it was more than 10 seconds that i wished these strangers bliss. reply post navigation previous postprevious terry laughlin, the master who changed my life (#276) next postnext tim o'reilly ‚Äì the trend spotter (#278) join 1.5m+ subscribers and receive exclusive tools, tips, and resources directly from tim: type your email address yes, sign me up for tim's free email newsletter. i agree to the privacy policy. get access twitter instagram facebook youtube linkedin click to subscribe apple podcasts spotify overcast popular podcasts bren√© brown ‚Äî striving versus self-acceptance, saving marriages, and more (#409) how to support healthcare workers now ‚Äî plus urgent suggestions for uber eats, hilton, amazon, and more (#416) jack kornfield ‚Äî how to find peace amidst covid-19, how to cultivate calm in chaos (#414) the top 25 episodes of the tim ferriss show from 2019 topics 30-day challenges (2) 4-hour case studies (50) automation (7) comfort challenges (4) dance (3) e-mail detox (23) entrepreneurship (60) fearless (2) filling the void (93) gadgets (15) geoarbitrage (8) interviews (29) investing (18) language (16) low-information diet (42) marketing (54) mental performance (42) mini-retirements (24) muse examples (9) nonsense (5) opening the kimono ‚Äì otk (4) outsourcing life (17) physical performance (51) practical philosophy (39) presentations (3) protecting time (14) psychedelics (14) quarterly shipments (3) random (29) remote offices (7) rockstar living in‚Ä¶ (5) rust and iron (2) science (5) the 4-hour body ‚Äì 4hb (48) the 4-hour chef ‚Äì 4hc (39) the 4-hour chef recipes (1) the book ‚Äì 4hww (44) the slow-carb diet (4) the tim ferriss experiment ‚Äì tfx (11) the tim ferriss show (394) the tim ferriss show transcripts (256) tim ferriss book club (6) tools of titans (8) travel (67) tribe of mentors (10) writing and blogging (35) books by tim ferriss the 4-hour workweek the 4-hour body the 4-hour chef tools of titans tribe of mentors we use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it. see our cookie policy here. sitemap site terms of service privacy policy copyright ¬© 2007‚Äì2020 tim ferriss. the 4-hour¬Æ is a registered trademark of tim ferriss. all rights reserved. privacy policy proudly powered by wordpress | hosted by pressable send to email address your name your email address cancel post was not sent - check your email addresses! email check failed, please try again sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.
