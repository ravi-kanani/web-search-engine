plugin dashboard uploading in wordpress dashboard download simplepress.zip from this page navigate to the ‘add new’ in the plugins dashboard navigate to the ‘upload’ area select simplepress.zip from your computer click ‘install now’ activate the plugin in the plugin dashboard using ftp download simplepress.zip from this page extract the simplepress directory to your computer upload the simplepress directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory activate the plugin in the plugin dashboard setup whatever the method you used, after you activated the plugin through the plugins dashboard, you now need to run through a set-up process. this creates the tables and default data that the plugin requires. you can access this setup process by either clicking the install button that should be visible at the top of the admin pages or by going to forum->install. at the conclusion of a successful install, a button will be displayed to load the forum admin and clicking on this will take you to the storage locations panel. all being well, all locations will be ticked as created and available but if this is not the case follow the instructions to manually create folders if necessary. getting started now that you have installed your forums read our getting started pages. faq i’ve installed the plugin – now what? now that you have installed your forums read our getting started pages. i don’t receive e-mail notifications there are several factors that can influence e-mail notifications delivery. the best thing you can do to diagnose email delivery issues is to install a plugin that shows you an email log. we recommend mailgun or smtp post. the logs will let you know if emails are being generated and not delivered or just not being generated at all. can can’t seem to create a new forum. when i select a forum group in which to create the forum, nothing happens. use your ctrl-f5 key to refresh your browser cache for that page. sometimes old css and js scripts just needs to be cleared out and ctrl-f5 does that. can i import data from my old forum? yes! you can import data into our forum from other forums including bbpress, asgaros and others. get the importer here; with a bit of development skill you can even build your own importer for something we don’t already have! or contact us to build one for you or to use our flat-fee import data service. i am a wordpress admin but i can’t see forum menu items when a new wordpress administrator is created by another wordpress admin, the new wp admin is not automatically granted rights to the forum. instead, an existing forum admin needs to explicitly grant the new wp admin forum priveleges under the forum->admins menu option. one of the nice consequences of this division of security is that you can make a user a forum admin without making them a wordpress admin. upon installation, existing wp admins are made forum admins; so this issue will only present itself when a new wp admin is created after the forum is installed. what shortcodes are available? simple:press does not use short-codes. instead, it outputs the entire forum directly into the content area of the wordpress page you specify. by default that page is called forum but you can easily switch it to a different page in forum->integration->page and permallinks. why is the forum so thin? many themes use a sidebar on their default wordpress pages. this reduces the content area that the forum is allowed to use. additionally, themes might designate a content are of only x% of the width of the screen. these two practices are the primary reasons why the forum might not look the way it should. however, the good news is that many of the higher quality themes provide a “full width” page template or allow you to change the default content area width of pages. contact your theme developer to find out if they have either of these two options. can i charge for forum access? there is no option in the forums plugin to charge for a membership or access to forums. but our simple:press member subscriptions plugin can help with that. it collects payments for memberships and includes options for integration with simple:press forums. additionally, all the other reputable membership plugins use wordpress roles to control their membership. simple:press forums does too. so you can use roles to integrate with most other membership plugins if you like. just contact us if you need more help understanding what this means. can i upload files to posts? the free version of the plugin does not allow file uploads. but the premium version does. the premium version also allow users to list, view and delete their prior file uploads. the free version of the plugin can still display images that are stored elsewhere – just paste the link to the image into the post editor. the editor looks barebones – is there a better one? the editor in the free version is a pure text editor. however, the premium version of simple:press comes with a full wysiwyg editor – the same one that wordpress uses – tinymce. reviews great product ssmeredith january 6, 2020 client was unhappy with bbpress and we successfully migrated their huge forum over to simplepress. excellent support throughout the process. really the only viable wordpress integrated forum out there to handle heavy traffic sites. thank you! extremely reliable, stable and mature plugin with superb support november 6, 2019 been using simple press forum software for 10 years now - since sep 2009. it’s simply the most reliable and best supported of all our plugins and users love it. it can be configured pretty thoroughly. most important of all, support is just fantastic. rapid responses and quick advice or even fixes when required. on one occasion, the main tech guy actually went into my site to diagnose a specific problem. that was over 3 years ago and i have not had to engage support since then. updates come out a few times a year – not too often to be a nuisance – but essentially the system has settled down and common teething troubles have mostly all been knocked on the head. it’s a mature piece of software. i would not hesitate to recommend it to any wp user and it’s well worth the modest cost for something so solid and worthwhile. the negative comments below just don’t make any sense to me. migrated data successfully from mingle forum organicsulfur4health august 29, 2019 i had been maintaining a mingle forum on my wp site for 6 years and neglected to make any changes after the developer stopped providing updates to his plugin. i belatedly decided to take the plunge to migrate my forum content to another developer. i first tried bbpress and their converter did a poor job of converting my archived data. various forum posts were missing after conversion, so i did some further research and decided to install simple:press and its conversion tool. voila! i've got a working forum with all my old data and have stopped getting error messages from sitelock that the discontinued mingle forum 1.0.35 plugin suffers from privilege escalation csrf. migration 5.x to 6.x successful! – thanks for continuing the plugin! david decker may 22, 2019 thanks to the simple:press team for continuing the plugin and releasing a 6.x version! i maintain a site with this forum plugin for a client and we could successfully migrate over. we are glad for the updates and all worked out great. one thing we think is now really good, is the child theme system for the forum themes. finally we can make updates without hassle. keep up the good work and let future improvements come! 😉 great forum at a fair price epppppp may 19, 2019 i've used simple press since 2008. nobody wants to pay for anything, myself included. however, it's a very good product and things have really changed in the last 10 years! for one thing, many plugins cost money and/or require a subscription. simple press is a robust system that provides pretty much, every feature you might want for your forum. further, if there is something new you want, the new team is incredibly responsive. for example, i asked for a plugin that would allow me to insert ads to better monetize my forum. the team added this ability within a month. that's impressive. if you've been at this for any amount of time, you know how important it is, that plugins are maintained. the new owners are keeping up. the lack of gratitude with these low ratings is appalling. i recall the months of angst, knowing the original plugin authors were going to retire. we were all going to be stuck with a forum that would have to be converted at some point and what? we'd have to pay for that, one way or the other. we are very lucky the buyer came in to save. i would hate to see the fee go any higher but i do think the forum and the plugins are worth $99 a year. there are rarely any problems and anything that does come up is quickly resolved in a professional manner. good product fashionghana november 14, 2019 super read all 12 reviews contributors & developers “simple:press – wordpress forum plugin” is open source software. the following
