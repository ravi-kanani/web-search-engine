(both stories could be true.) after col. elisha leighton’s return to antwerp he had a bad illness, became temporarily insane, and on his recovery turned roman catholic. in june 1656 leighton deserted buckingham on the pretext that the duke did not ‘rightly submit to the king’. (he was right: by 1657 buckingham had tired of his life in exile and returned to england. convincing oliver cromwell that he was harmless, buckingham won back his property by marrying the heiress of the man who held most of his lands - lord thomas fairfax, late general of the parliamentary forces.) col. elisha leighton subsequently became secretary to james, duke of york, and was knighted at brussels in april 1659. at the restoration sir elisha leighton made his peace with buckingham, and was indebted to him for preferment. sir elisha leighton had a talent for mechanics, and became a f.r.s. on 9 dec. 1663 … on 28 april 1664 leighton was made one of the secretaries of the prize office (cal. state papers, dom. 1663–4, p. 571). for more information see https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/leighton,_elisha_(… log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1664 jan 11 oct 18 1665 jan 25 dec 20 1666 jun 10 1667 jan 23 mar 26 27 latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
