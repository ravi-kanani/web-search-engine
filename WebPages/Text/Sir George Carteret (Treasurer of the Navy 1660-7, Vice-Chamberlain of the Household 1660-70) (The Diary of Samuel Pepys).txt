wikipedia; jersey evening post; and his descendent chart. carteret’s famous years at jersey, where he defended the island in the name of charles i, declared charles ii king, and ran a lucrative privateering campaign are captured in the 1896 book by the reverend alban ragg a popular history of jersey, chapters xii-xv. for those interested in more information on island of jersey during the years of sir philip carteret, george’s uncle and father of his wife, elizabeth, a selection from the book jean chevalier and his times prior to the great rebellion is available online. the site hosting this book extract is home to le cercle de carteret who have extended an offer for ‘family and friends’ of the carteret’s to take part in their upcoming activities, as updated on their site. prior to the diary: the jersey years the relationship between carteret and the king is one of the rare “lifetime” relationships that charles faithfully maintained. this relationship and extensive background on carteret during his “jersey years” is highlighted in this article. the following selection from that article, which is a quote from a.c. saunders’ jean chevalier and his times provides saunders’ character sketch of carteret, during his jersey years: there was not much sentiment about george carteret. he knew what he wanted and was determined to get it. a great sailor and a faithful servant to the king and the royal cause, he realized that, when he became lieutenant-governor and had taken up duties in the island, he would be in a very dangerous position, and that if he failed, the parliamentarians would show him little mercy. he was a much stronger character than his uncle, the late sir philip [who had role prior to him], but had the same accumulative tendencies and was very fond of power and riches and, later on, was known in england as the rich sir george. he was very brave and had very considerable organizing ability and he allowed few scruples to interfere with his plans for the good of the cause he had at heart, and he was determined to grant stern justice to those who, during the last year of his uncle’s life, had treated him so badly. the parliamentarians had little encouragement to submit their grievances to his sense of justice. he would admit of no grievances and considered that for their past actions they deserved utmost penalties. many fled from the island, but during the next eight years those remaining could get little assistance or support from the english parliament. sir george was all powerful in jersey and, in all his actions, was supported by the members of the states who were always ready to follow his lead. therefore he was always careful before taking any action in the island to see that his conduct was in accordance with the legal procedure of the island. therefore until 1651 he was the dictator of the island, and maintained the honour of the royalist cause and, gathering together a number of ships and manning them with gallant mariners, he was able to spread terror among the english vessels trading to and from english ports, in the english channel. it is only a great man who could have done what he did in keeping the royal standard flying for nearly three years after the execution of charles i, and historians in the past have done little justice to the gallant stand made by sir george and his supporters in the little island of jersey, a stand which required the greatest admiral, blake, with seventy ships and three thousand men to put down, and then only after sir george had been granted full honours of war. notwithstanding his many faults and his lack of sympathy in his dealing with opponents, who were not faultless, he may be considered as one of the greatest leaders during the civil wars, and the royalist stand in jersey as one of the great epochs in history. carteret in the diary sam’s early assessment of carteret is that he is a “good-natured man’ and notes he is well positioned among other noteworthy individuals in the kings’ coronation procession. sam’s early naval involvement with carteret includes preparation of a letter for the duke of york summarizing the poor financial state of the navy; examining the treasurer’s accounts; getting money from the duke of york ;paying off ship debts; and happily recording his belief that carteret is pleased with him. an argument between carteret and mr. coventry causes sam angst and starts a string of diary entries about coventry’s bad feelings towards carteret. two months later, sam records with happiness that carteret has put in a good word with the lord chancellor on his behalf. conflicts arise in 1663 with a great dispute over the valuation of pieces of eight and sam talks against carteret. further discord takes place over issues with the mast contract causing sam to craft a letter to carteret. a rather mistrusting sam gets a vote of confidence from carteret on the mast issues, and the two finally come to a positive understanding of each other. sam is delighted to hear from carteret that the navy is finally out of debt. sam and carteret find themselves collectively embroiled with an angry lord chancellor over issues related to the taking of trees from clarendon park for use by the navy. any angry clarendon rages to sam about carteret and the issue continues in carteret’s disfavor with clarendon. the relationship between sam and carteret will grow both professionally and to some extent, personally. as the diary proceeds, sam will find himself involved in more of carteret’s personal life and family matters, which he will splendidly record. he will also find himself witnessing the fall out the record keeping issues of the dutch war, where carteret will become the target of accusations. as a result of these accounting issues, carteret will be censured by parliament and in 1667 will leave his role as treasurer of the navy and will become the deputy treasurer of ireland, and no longer involved with sam in the remaining years of the diary. further resources biographies and related non-fiction about sir george carteret are listed below. carteret kept a journal during his trip to the barbary coast in 1638, which was printed in limited edition in 1929. jean chevalier, a jersey man, kept a wonderful diary during the years that sir george was governor of the island. the original is in french but the saunders books draws heavily on the chevalier diary. these books may be available through your local library (with the help of the research department) or are sometimes available through the used book search. some may be available on the us amazon or uk amazon. all for the king by g.r. balleine jean chevalier and his times by a. c. saunders sir george carteret, lord proprietor of new jersey, with a notice of the isle of jersey, and a brief sketch of lord john berkeley by william nelson the barbary voyage of 1638 by sir george carteret wikipedia this text was copied from wikipedia on 22 march 2020 at 6:03am. sir george carteret, bt sir george carteret born c.1610 jersey died 19 january 1680 allegiance kingdom of england service/branch royal navy rank vice admiral commands held treasurer of the navy comptroller of the navy hms mary rose arms of carteret: gules, four fusils in fess argent vice admiral sir george carteret, 1st baronet (c.1610—18 january 1680 n.s.) was a royalist statesman in jersey and england, who served in the clarendon ministry as treasurer of the navy. he was also one of the original lords proprietor of the former british colony of carolina and new jersey. carteret, new jersey, as well as carteret county, north carolina, both in the united states, are named after him. he acquired the manor of haynes, bedfordshire (alias hawnes) in about 1667.[1] contents 1 early life 2 civil war and commonwealth 3 restoration 4 american colonies 5 later life 6 family 7 see also 8 further reading 9 notes 10 references early life carteret was the son of elias de carteret and elizabeth dumaresq of jersey, who both died in 1640 (george dropped the "de" from his surname when he entered the english navy, concerned that it sounded too french). he was "bred for the sea" and served as an officer in various naval ships in the 1630s and commanded the mary rose before becoming comptroller of the navy in 1641.[2] as a result of his early life at sea, he received little or no formal education, and his embarrassing ignorance was a source of much ridicule in later life. andrew marvell mocked his poor command of english, and samuel pepys remarked that his ignorance of even the most basic latin phrases would cause a schoolboy to be whipped. "such ignorance is not to be borne in a privy councillor', wrote pepys severely. civil war and commonwealth on the commencement of the civil war he retired from the navy, and withdrew with his family to jersey, but subsequently returned to aid the projects of the royalists. he afterwards, on the ruin of the royal cause, afforded an asylum to the prince of wales (charles stuart) and other refugees of distinction within his government of jersey, where he served as bailiff (1643–1651),[2] and defended jersey against the parliamentarians: the island in october and then elizabeth castle, finally surrendering in december 1651. george carteret also had charles ii proclaimed king in saint helier on 17 february 1649, after the execution of his father, charles i.[3] charles ii never forgot this gesture. however, he had to surrender jersey to the commonwealth of england. he then went into exile in france, where he was imprisoned in 1657 and then exiled from there, after which he went to venice. the warmth and kindness with which he received the refugees earned him a permanent place in the king's affections, and also the friendship of edward hyde, 1st earl of clarendon, the king's chief adviser during his exile and for the first few years after the restoration. restoration carteret was sworn into the privy council, appointed vice-chamberlain of the household, and constituted treasurer of the navy.[2] his career for the next decade is documented in the diary of samuel pepys, who joined him as clerk of the acts to the navy board in 1660. in 1667, he exchanged his office as vice-chamberlain with lord anglesey for that of vice-treasurer of ireland, an office which he sold in 1669 for £11,000.[2] his influence seems to have been at its height in 1665, when he boasted to pepys that the king did nothing without his knowledge; however, as the naval war dragged on, the treasurer of the navy was an obvious target of the opposition, and pepys noted that by the spring of 1666 carteret was being attacked on all sides. by the autumn of 1667, he confessed to pepys that he was longing for the quiet of retirement. as treasurer he was hard working and free from any suspicion of corruption, although his colleagues at the navy board complained that they found his accounts difficult to follow. from 1661 to 1679 he represented portsmouth, sponsored by the admiralty, in the cavalier parliament. although sitting on a number of committees he was a fairly inactive member of the house. [4] american colonies the fidelity with which carteret, like john berkeley, 1st baron berkeley of stratton, had clung to the royal cause, gave him also great influence at court: he was close to clarendon, and to the earl of sandwich, whose daughter married carteret's eldest son. he had, at an early date, taken a warm interest in the colonization of america. in recognition of all the help given to him during his exile in jersey in the 1640s, charles ii gave carteret a large grant of land previously named new netherland, which was promptly renamed new jersey under his charge.[5] with berkeley, he became one of the proprietors of the province of carolina prior to their becoming jointly interested in east jersey. carteret county, north carolina and town of carteret, new jersey are named after him,[2] and the city of elizabeth, new jersey, is named after his wife,[6] as is elizabethtown, north carolina.[7] in 1665, carteret was one of the drafters of the concession and agreement, a document that provided freedom of religion in the colony of new jersey. it was issued as a proclamation for the structure of the government for the colony written by the two proprietors, lord berkeley and sir george carteret. later life in 1669, he faced expulsion from the house of commons for misconduct as vice chamberlain, being accused of embezzlement.[8] after a statement from the king expressing his satisfaction with carteret and an acquittal by the house of lords, the inquiry against him lapsed. he was, in fact, generally regarded as an honest man.[9] in 1673, he was appointed one of the lords of the admiralty, and continued in the public service until his death on 14 january 1680. shortly before carteret's death, the king proposed to give him the title baron carteret, but carteret died too soon, so the honour was granted to his grandson george. family in the chapel of mont orgueil castle, may 1640, george carteret married his cousin elizabeth de carteret, daughter of philippe de carteret ii, 3rd seigneur de sark and his wife anne dowse.[2] they had three sons- philip (1641–1672), their eldest son, married lady jemima monague, daughter of edward montagu, 1st earl of sandwich, and had four children: his eldest son george was raised to the peerage. philip was killed at the battle of sole bay, along with his father-in-law; jemima had died in childbirth in november of the previous year. james (died after 1679), was a captain in the royal navy, married and had children george (died 1656), who died unmarried. - and five daughters: elizabeth (who never married) rachel louisa-margaret, who married sir robert atkyns of sapperton, only son of sir robert atkyns, lord chief baron of the exchequer; her family nickname was "louisonne", according to samuel pepys anne (died 1668), "a pious and sweet-tempered lady", who married sir nicholas slanning, 1st baronet, no issue caroline, who married sir thomas scott of scot's hall, son of edward scott[10] and lady catherine goring, daughter of george goring, 1st earl of norwich. samuel pepys liked and admired lady carteret "the most kind lady in the world." see also history of jersey further reading new jersey archives, first series. newark, nj, 1880–1893, volume 1, page 25. whitehead, william adee, east jersey under the proprietary governments. new york, new-jersey historical society, 1846, page 104. o'callaghan, ed., documents relating to the colonial history of the state of new york, 1849–1851. volume 2, page 410. marvell, andrew, the poems and letters of andrew marvell; edited by h. m. margoliouth. 3d ed. rev. by pierre legouis with the collaboration of e. e. duncan-jones. oxford, clarendon press, 1971. chisholm, hugh, ed.

did not like school,or his early teacher (pipon), but loved the sea. balleine in “all for the king”, says “george hated the school. he hated pierre pipon, the regent. the syntax problems of the ancient romans roused in him no spark of curiosity. in later life his ignorance of the classics shocked some of his colleagues. once, when he saw hangings in the duke of york’s chamber depicting a scene in rome, he asked pepys what the s.p.q.r. on the standards stood for, “ignorance”, scoffed the diarist, “not to be borne in a privy councillor; methinks a schoolboy would be whipped for not knowing”. yet george’s schooltime was not wasted. scores of his letters survive, which show that he could express himself in good grammatical english, remarkably good when one remembers that french was his native tongue. his spelling was better than that of many of the other courtiers, and the detailed reports that he wrote of his two expeditions are admirably lucid and graphic. moreover the intricate financial transactions that he had to control later, first as treasurer of the navy, and then as vice-treasurer of ireland show that he must have been no mean arithmetician. pierre pipon had not wielded the birch in vain.” (p. 5) george also left school at an early age to go to sea (around age 13 or younger). lady fanshaw (who knew him well) says in her memoirs that he was “bred as a sea-boy”. (p. 5) another interesting point is that “no scandal marred his record”, so the libertine court of charles ii and the loose morals of the time did not seem to be a pull to him as there are no mentions of mistresses and his love letters to his wife during their courtship have a nice sincerity to them. finally, in a general context, balleine says” carteret was no dashing hero of romance like montrose or rupert, though, as many of his exploits show, as a fighting man he was utterly fearless: but we see him mainly as a sober, hard-working servant of the king whose royalism was his religion. a simple, undeviating, almost doglike devotion to the crown was the mainspring of all of his actions. he had his faults, including one bad one [which isn’t mentioned here],which we have tried not to disguise;but he remains an outstanding example of the cavalier ideal of utter and unswerving loyalty, an ideal which his family enshrined in their motto ‘loyal devoir’”.
