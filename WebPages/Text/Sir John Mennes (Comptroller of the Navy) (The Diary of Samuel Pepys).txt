pepys, who reported directly to mennes at the navy office, thought him an incompetent civil servant but a delightful social companion. contents 1 career 1.1 mennes and samuel pepys 2 poetry 3 shakespeare anecdote 4 family 5 references career he was the third son of andrew mennes of sandwich, kent, and jane blechnden.[1] educated at his local grammar school in sandwich, and corpus christi college, oxford, mennes went to sea and in 1620 saw action off dominica fighting spanish warships.[1] in 1628 he was given command of hms adventure and later he commanded hms garland, hms red lion, hms vanguard, hms convertine, hms nonsuch and hms victory.[1] in august 1641 he took queen henrietta maria to safety in hellevoetsluis in the netherlands and was knighted by king charles i for doing so and in july 1642 he refused to accept the parliamentary takeover of the fleet.[1] in 1643, once the king had lost the navy, he transferred to the army and became a general of artillery and in 1644 he became governor of north wales.[1] in 1645 he was appointed commander-in-chief at the downs until 1649. in 1650 he left england to join the exiled court abroad.[1] mennes and samuel pepys in november 1661, following the restoration of the monarchy, he was commissioned vice admiral and commander in chief in the narrow seas, and captain of henry and commander of the fleet taking the earl of peterborough to occupy english tangier.[2] this appears to have been his last active commission. before the voyage, he had been appointed comptroller of the navy.[1] samuel pepys, who as clerk of the acts reported directly to mennes, described him as "ill at ease" in this role (which in fairness to mennes has been described as "impossibly burdensome") and when exasperated by mennes' incompetence, as he all too frequently was, would refer to him in his diary as a "coxcomb", "dolt", "dotard" and "old fool". outside office hours, however, pepys admitted that mennes, with his skills as a poet and mimic, was the best of company. pepys describes a memorable evening when mennes and john evelyn engaged in a mimicry contest; mennes with great generosity admitted that evelyn was the winner. pepys's kindest judgment on him (when he was wrongly thought to be dying in 1666) was that he was a "good, honest, harmless gentleman, but not fit for office". dissatisfaction with mennes became general, and sporadic efforts were made by his colleagues to have him removed, without success. it is generally thought that he owed his survival to the increasingly bitter attacks on the navy board in the house of commons: the king was reluctant to sacrifice mennes, as this might have led to an all out attack on the administration of one of the most important departments of state. even pepys was prepared in 1670 to defend mennes in public before the house of commons as a man of great integrity who had worn out his health in the service of the crown.[3] he died in london in 1671, aged 71, while still in the post of controller. the bulk of his estate passed to his nephew francis hammond.[1] poetry a 1683 edition of poems by mennes his poetry was published in a collection entitled musarum deliciæ or the muses's recreation, in 1656. mennes's verses appear to have been written for amusement in correspondence with dr. james smith, whose replies were also included. both were light and satirical in tone. the publisher, henry herringman, stated that the poems had been collected by him from "sir john mennis and dr. smith's drolish intercourses." another anthology called wit restored was published in 1658. this contains verse letters from smith to mennes, "then commanding a troop of horse against the scots." another piece was written to mennes "on the surrender of conway castle." a satirical poem on john suckling's feeble military efforts at the battle of newburn is attributed to mennes. mennes was himself satirised by john denham, whose poem about mennes going from calais to boulogne to "eat a pig" is mentioned by samuel pepys in his diary.[4] shakespeare anecdote according to thomas plume mennes told him that he had once met william shakespeare's father john shakespeare, describing him as a "merry cheeked old man" who said of his son that "will was a good honest fellow, but he durst have cracked a jest with him at any time."[5] as katherine duncan-jones points out, this is impossible, since mennes was two years old when john shakespeare died. she thinks plume may have been recording an anecdote related by mennis taken from his father.[6] family in 1641 he married jane liddel (died 1662); she may have been his second wife. they had no children.[1] in his later years, according to pepys, his widowed sister mary hammon or hammond (died 1668), mother of francis, kept house for him. in addition to his nephew francis he had at least two nieces to whom he left legacies; his niece elizabeth hammond was his executrix. references ^ a b c d e f g h i john mennes at oxford dictionary of national biography. ^ tanner, j r (1903). a descriptive catalogue of the naval manuscripts in the pepysian library. 1. the navy records society. pp. 314, 383..mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:"\"""\"""'""'"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/lock-green.svg/9px-lock-green.svg.png")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-lock-red-alt-2.svg.png")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/wikisource-logo.svg/12px-wikisource-logo.svg.png")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em} ^ the diary of samuel pepys ^ robert bell, lives of the most eminent literary scientific men of great britain, longmans, 1839, p.56. ^ kate pogue, shakespeare's family, greenwood, 2008, p. 24. ^ katherine duncan-jones, ungentle shakespeare: scenes from his life, cengage learning emea, 2001, p.8 14 annotations ✹ pauline on 11 apr 2004 • link (1599-71). comptroller of the navy 1660-71. he entered the navy as a youth....during 1635-9 he was continuously at sea, attaining the rank of vice-admiral, and later (1642) rear-admiral. he served in the army in the scottish war and commanded a troop of horse for the king in the civil war.....and during the '50s acted as a royalist agent abroad. at the restoration he was commissioned to the "henry" in 1660, becoming commander-in-chief in the downs and narrow seas 1661-2. he had by this time won a reputation as a man of action, a witty conversationalist, a learned chemist who dabbled in medicine and a writer of amusing, if usually coarse, verse. but in nov. 1661 he was made comptroller and moved into a world of government finance and book-keeping in which he was a stranger and ill at ease. from l&m companion. just part of the entry, more information for later in the diary. ✹ vincent on 11 apr 2004 • link supplementary info:sir john mennes (1599-1671), admiral portrait available[1640 mid life]. http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?li… was captain of vanguard 1635. http://battleshiphmsvanguard.homestead.com/van2.h… history of the ship known for : many claiments to this wise saying but my guess it was from the a latin reader with tacitus http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/t/tacitu… brewer: dictionary of phrase and fable, 459-460 ... he that fights and runs away may live to fight another day;

"a 'drollery' during the interregnum came to mean 'an anthology built around the verse of mennes, smith, and their circle' (114). several of the more famous titles are musarum deliciae (1655), wit and drollery (1656), and wit restor'd (1658)....[w]hile they were not exactly the parents of the octosyllabic doggerel style, they were perhaps its midwives: they gave it its distinctive tone, and they popularized it" (215). some of the writers raylor identifies as having inherited this legacy were samuel butler, george etherege, john dryden, alexander pope, and jonathan swift." patrick, k.e.
