and yields to none of them in candour and integrity. he served the worthy earl of southampton in the office of secretary to the treasury; an employment which he had enjoyed in the former reign. he acquitted himself in this office with such abilities as did honour to them both: but the earl's enemies insinuated, that all the honour was due to the secretary, and usually called him "sir philip the treasurer." the most considerable of his works is his "memoirs, or reflections upon the reign of king charles i." this book was published by dr. thomas smith, the learned writer concerning the greek church. but the doctor's preface, of some pages, having been not altogether pleasing to the administration at that time, it has been suffered to stand in very few copies. he died the 15th of january, 1682. ---a biographical history of england. j. granger, 1775. ✹ bill on 2 feb 2014 • link warwick, sir philip (1609-1683), politician and historian;
