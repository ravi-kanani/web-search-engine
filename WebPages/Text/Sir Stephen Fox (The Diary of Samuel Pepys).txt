then he entered the service of lord percy, the earl's younger brother, and was present with the royalist army at the battle of worcester as lord percy's deputy at the ordnance board. accompanying king charles ii in his flight to the continent, he was appointed manager of the royal household on the recommendation of edward hyde, 1st earl of clarendon. clarendon described him as "a young man bred under the severe discipline of lord percy ... very well qualified with languages, and all other parts of clerkship, honesty and discretion". the skill with which fox managed the finances of the exiled court earned him further confidence and promotion. he was employed on several important missions, and acted eventually as intermediary between the king and general monck. honours and emolument were his reward after the restoration of the monarchy; he was appointed to the lucrative offices of first clerk of the green cloth and paymaster of the forces. paymaster of the forces immediately on his restoration, king charles ii struggled to fund the new standing army, a concept invented by oliver cromwell during the civil war and the following commonwealth. the problem was solved by fox, who was deemed "one of the financial wizards of his age", and from 1654 to 1660 had managed the finances of the exiled king with great success.[8] the king established a new office of paymaster of the forces, of which fox was the first occupant, with premises in a wing of horseguards in whitehall. his success in restoring the financial position of the army stemmed from his ability to raise credit in the city of london, largely thanks to his reputation for honesty and reliability, which would later be repaid to him by the treasury, when parliament so voted. the yield from bills passed to this effect were often below that forecast, which in the absence of loans would leave the troops unpaid. fox, however, was personally liable for the loans he raised, and to compensate him for the great risks he undertook, he was allowed to retain certain profits on his repayment by the treasury. he charged the treasury 6% on the funds he had borrowed, but much of that he repaid to his own creditors.[9] he was allowed other perquisites, including 2% bonus on capital and interest repaid to him by the treasury, and "poundage" from 1667 which allowed him to retain 4 pence, and from 1668 one shilling, in every pound of army pay, ostensibly to cover administration costs, but in reality mostly profit. this therefore amounted to one twentieth of all army pay, an annual income for fox of about £7,000, added to his official salary of £400 per annum, and whatever he could save from borrowing at rates below 6%. in just 20 months from january 1665 to september 1666 he advanced a total of £221,000 for army pay, on repayment of which he received interest from the treasury of almost £13,000. in addition he received a further 2% bonus, worth another £3,000 and also poundage.[10] this office he held for 15 years between 1661 and 1676, and for another year in 1679–1680. political career in november 1661 he became a member of parliament for salisbury. in 1665 he was knighted; was returned as a member of parliament for westminster on 27 february 1679, and succeeded the earl of rochester as a commissioner of the treasury, filling that office for twenty-three years and during three reigns. in 1672 he bought the manor of redlynch in somerset, where he built a new house in 1708–1709.[11] in 1680 he resigned the paymastership and was made first commissioner of horse. in 1684 he became sole commissioner of horse. he was offered a peerage by king james ii, on condition of converting to roman catholicism, but refused, in spite of which he was allowed to retain his commissionerships. in 1685 he was again an mp for salisbury, and opposed the bill for a standing army supported by the king. during the glorious revolution, he maintained an attitude of decent reserve, but on james's flight, he submitted to the new king william iii, who confirmed him in his offices. he was again elected for westminster in 1691 and 1695, for cricklade in 1698, and finally in 1713 once more for salisbury. it is his distinction to have founded royal hospital chelsea, to which he contributed £13,000. as a statesman he was second-rate, but as a public servant he creditably discharged all the duties with which he was entrusted. unlike some other statesmen of his day, he grew rich in the service of the nation without being suspected of corruption or forfeiting the esteem of his contemporaries. marriages & progeny fox married twice: mural monument to elizabeth whittle (d.1696), first wife of sir stephen fox, in the ilchester chapel of farley church firstly on 8 december 1651, at the age of 24, to elizabeth whittle (died 11 august 1696), a daughter of william whittle of the city of london, whose mural monument with bust survives in the ilchester chapel of farley church. his niece margaret fox (buried on 22 june 1729), a daughter of his elder brother john, also married a member of the whittle family.[6] by elizabeth whittle he had seven sons, all of whom predeceased him, and three daughters, including: william fox (1660–1680), eldest son, a captain in the army. a mural monument survives in the north cloister of westminster abbey inscribed in latin and translated as follows: "near this place, among the ashes of their three brothers edward, john and stephen, sleep william and james fox, sons of the honorable sir stephen fox, kt. and elizabeth his wife. parents and sons worthy each other, whom love made one in life, one distemper in death and one grave in burial. each of them was embellished with useful learning, which their modesty seemed to conceal, and in their youth the man grew up with them. they were born for their country and to honours, which the eldest, being captain in the army, acquired by his fatigues over all england. william died april 17, 1680 aged 20. james died november 19, 1677 aged 13".[6] charles fox (1660–1713), 2nd son, a member of parliament for salisbury and paymaster of the forces to kings james ii, william iii and to queen anne.[12] his mural monument survives in the ilchester chapel of farley church. edward fox (1663–1669), 4th son, died aged six, buried with his brother john fox in westminster abbey, where survives his gravestone in the cloisters inscribed: here lie interred two children of the right worshipful sir stephen fox of farley in the county of wilts knight, viz. edward fox, his fourth son, aged six years and one month, who died on the nineteenth day of octob. 1669. and john fox his sixth son of the age of one year, who deceased upon the seventeenth day of novemb. in the year of our lord 1667.[13] james fox (1665–1677), 5th son, died of smallpox[6] on 19 november 1677 aged 12, buried in the cloister of westminster abbey, where survives his mural monument inscribed in latin as follows: hic infra situs est, juxta edwardi, johannis, & stephani, trium fratrum cineres, selectissimus adolescentulus jacobus fox, honoratissimi domini steph. fox equiti aurati & elizabethae uxoris, filius natu quintus, parentes filio & filius parentibus quam dignissimus. summa pietate, vel puer quoad deum;

sir stephen taking as much delight to see them rise gradually, and form them into what they were to be, as to buy them of the nursery gardeners, finish' d to his hand; besides that by this method his greens, the finest in england, cost him nothing but the labour of his servants, and about ten years patience; which if they were to have been purchased, would not have cost so little as ten thousand pounds, especially at that time: it was here that king william was so pleased that according to his majesty's usual expression, when he lik'd a place very well, he stood, and looking round him from the head of one of the canals, well says his majesty, i cou'd dwell here five days; every thing was so exquisitely contrived, finish'd, and well kept, that the king, who was allow'd to be the best judge of such things then living in the world, did not so much as once say, this or that thing cou'd have been better. after fox's death in 1716 it was sold to the countess of northampton, the mother-in-law of fox's daughter jane.[18] it was later re-named moreton hall after a later 18th-century owner.[18] redlynch, somerset, an estate fox acquired in 1672 in settlement of a debt due from the gorges family. in 1688 he commenced repairs to the large 16th-century house then standing. in 1708/9 he commenced building a new house adjacent to the old one, to the designs of the architect thomas fort, and also developed the formal gardens. palace of whitehall, westminster, where before 1677 he rebuilt his lodgings at his own expense.[3] other building works fox constructed further buildings including: all saints church, farley, built 1688–90 by sir stephen fox to the design of sir christopher wren. it contains the "ilchester chapel", burial place of fox and many of his descendants all saints church, farley, 1688–1690, to the design of sir christopher wren, probably with alexander fort, joiner to his majesty's office of works.[2] he obtained a private act of parliament to make it into a parish church, as it replaced a mere chapel of ease to the adjoining parish of alderbury.[22] fox's hospital, farley, an almshouse with schoolroom, 1688–1690, by alexander fort, joiner to his majesty's office of works. total cost £1835.8s.8d.[23] established for six poor women, with a master, and a free-school, the master to be a clergyman, and to officiate in the church.[24] continues to operate as a charity.[25] a stone tablet below a broken pediment containing a bust of a winged putto, affixed to the external wall above the central doorway, is inscribed in latin as follows deo opt(imo) max(imo) bonarum omnium largitori isthoc quantulumcumque grati animi monumentum acceptum refert scholae huius et ptochotrophii fundator humilis gratabundus anno salutis reparatae mdclxxxi quid tibi divitiae prosunt quas congeris hospes solas quas dederis semper habebis opes.
