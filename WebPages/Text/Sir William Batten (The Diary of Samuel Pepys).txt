pepys also thought that the battens were living well beyond their means. certainly at batten's death he left an estate smaller than the family seem to have expected. his heavily indebted eldest son, also named william, sold walthamstow and all his father's other real property in the 1670s. family batten married first in 1625 margaret browne, daughter of william browne, by whom he had six children, of whom at least four survived him: william junior (a barrister of lincoln's inn), benjamin, who followed his father into the navy, mary, who married james lemon (or leming), and martha (born 1637) who in 1663 married william castle, a shipwright ("i do not envy him his wife," wrote pepys spitefully). all the children and their spouses are referred to in pepys's diary: he has little good to say of them in general (detesting william castle in particular), although with his usual eye for an attractive woman, he admired young william batten's wife, margaret alcock. rather illogically, given his poor relations with the family, he was offended at not being invited to the christening of young william's first child (yet another william) in 1663. margaret browne's brother, captain john browne, was master of the ship rosebud. pepys, who evidently liked him, expressed his regret at browne's death in 1663, apparently as a result of a drunken fracas with a sailor. batten married secondly, in 1659, elizabeth woodstocke (née turner), widow of william woodstocke of westminster. pepys, although he appreciated her presents of home-grown wine, came to dislike lady batten as much as he did her husband, and in his diary made attacks on her virtue, which seem to have had no foundation in fact.[11] death batten died, "after being but two days sick" on 5 october 1667. pepys, despite their past bad relations, wrote that he was sorry for the death of a good neighbour. he did not attend the funeral, but took an interest in the quarrels between lady batten and her stepchildren over the size of her husband's estate; lady batten later complained that "she had been left a beggar." pepys records his condolence call on the widow, noting that widows weep for their husbands, but soon leave off grieving, as is natural given the cares of the world.[12] in 1671 she remarried, as his second wife, johan barckmann, baron leijonbergh, the swedish resident to the english court (subsequently ambassador 1672–91); she died in 1683. a quarrel between pepys and leijonbergh, which led to an abortive duel, may have been caused by lady batten's claim that pepys was withholding money due to the batten estate.[13] footnotes ^ harris (1920), p. 52. ^ stephen and leslie (1908), p. 1338. ^ calendar of state papers, domestic, charles i, 1628-29. ^ conway (1906), pp. 144–145. ^ register of the privy council of scotland, november 1629. ^ andrews (1991), p. 44. ^ a b c d e f one or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: chisholm, hugh, ed.

[1] 1893 text clarendon describes william batten as an obscure fellow, and, although unknown to the service, a good seaman, who was in 1642 made surveyor to the navy; in which employ he evinced great animosity against the king. the following year, while vice-admiral to the earl of warwick, he chased a dutch man-of-war into burlington bay, knowing that queen henrietta maria was on board; and then, learning that she had landed and was lodged on the quay, he fired above a hundred shot upon the house, some of which passing through her majesty’s chamber, she was obliged, though indisposed, to retire for safety into the open fields. this act, brutal as it was, found favour with the parliament. but batten became afterwards discontented; and, when a portion of the fleet revolted, he carried the “constant warwick,” one of the best ships in the parliament navy, over into holland, with several seamen of note. for this act of treachery he was knighted and made a rear-admiral by prince charles. we hear no more of batten till the restoration, when he became a commissioner of the navy, and was soon after m.p. for rochester. see an account of his second wife, in note to november 24th, 1660, and of his illness and death, october 5th, 1667. he had a son, benjamin, and a daughter, martha, by his first wife.—b. this text comes from a footnote on a diary entry in the 1893 edition edited by henry b. wheatley. 11 annotations ✹ vincent on 14 oct 2003 • link more on this admiral: http://49.1911encyclopedia.org/b/ba/batten_sir_wi… http://www.rickard.karoo.net/peoplemain6.html ----------------- from the will of sir w. batten "... mingo - from servant to lighthouse keeper give and bequeath to my servante mingoe a negroe that now dwelleth with mee the somme of tenne pounds to be paid within twelve monethes next after my decease and i doe alsoe give unto him the said mingoe the custody and keeping of my light houses att harwich, and the somme of twenty pounds a yeare of lawfull money of england during the terme of his naturall life for his paines therein ..." http://www.pro.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/work_… ✹ vincent on 2 nov 2003 • link from paul brewster on sat 1 nov 2003, sir w. batten’s country house l&amp;m: “the rectory manor house, church hill, walthamstow, essex. penn later had a house not far away at wanstead.” location http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=537715&am… an 1848 directory http://www.essexvillages.net/villages/walthamstow… “the nearby rectory manor estate was sold as building plots after the demolition of the old manor house facing church hill in 1897” http://mazalon.co.uk/aroundwalthamstow.htm ✹ vincent on 15 feb 2004 • link gleened from will: he did have "... my grandchild mary leming my grandchild william castle my sister martha bradford prob 11/325, q. 144 m maid servants rachell underhill and martha peake + mingo..." ✹ vincent on 23 feb 2004 • link sailing days 1642:william batten, vice admiral :[capt: ] his ship in the 1642 rainbow [a class 2:] his no 1: lutten, commanded the following : 260 men, ships wt:721 tons: no of guns 40 was built in 1617, fit for 10 yrs gleaned from http://www.portsdown.demon.co.uk/sw_g42.htm ✹ vicenzo on 10 mar 2005 • link got his letter of "sir" "...that the letter of the lord admiral from warwick house, of 21 decembris 1648, and the indemnity of the lord admiral unto captain wm. batten, now called sir wm. batten..." : http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compi… batten also heavily involved in the capture of the scilly isles as vice admiral: : http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compi…, sir george more on the formalities of and paper work. : http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compi…, sir george he knew first hand about vittals. a letter from captain wm. batten, vice admiral, of the twenty-ninth of august;

middleton, his successor, complained of the state of his papers at his death; and the chatham chest under his direction remained as badly run as ever. in 1665 and 1666 batten spent a lot of time in the yards, where he was probably more at home than at an office desk. ✹ bob blair on 27 may 2007 • link batten's name appears 4 times in clarendon's history, books 5 and 6. in book 5.44, which deals with events in march, 1641/42: "...by this means, the vice-admiralty, which was designed to captain cartwright, the comptroller of the navy, who hath since sufficiently testified how advantageously to his majesty he would have managed that charge, upon his refusal (which shall be hereafter mentioned) was conferred upon batten, an obscure fellow, and, though a good seaman, unknown to the navy, till he was, two or three years before [sept. 1638] for money, made surveyor, who executed it ever since with great animosity against the king's service . . . ." in 5.378, which deals with june of that year and the disasterously incompetent attempt of the king to put john pennington back in control of the fleet by coup: "mr. villiers hastened to the ships which lay then at anchor, and according to his instructions, delivered his several letters to the captains [july 2]; the greatest part whereof received them with great expressions of duty and submission, expecting only to receive sir john pennington's orders, for which they staid, and, without doubt, if either the first letters had been sent, or sir john pennington been present, when these others were delivered, his majesty had been possessed of his whole fleet; the earl of warwick [the admiral] being at that time, according to his usual licences, with some officers, whose company he liked, on shore making merry; so that there was only his vice-admiral, captain batten, on board, who was of eminent disaffection to his majesty; the rear-admiral, sir john mennes, being of unquestionable integrity." in 5.382, which backs up a bit and talks about the period in late 1641 when the parliament was asserting control in the navy: "...the king, looking upon the fleet in a manner taken from him, when another [the earl of warwick], whose disaffection to his service was very notorious, was, contrary to his express pleasure, presumptuously put into the command of it, and his own minister [sir john pennington] displaced for no other reason (his sufficiency and ability for command being by all men confessed) but his zeal and integrity to him, and therefore he would not countenance that fleet, and that admiral, with suffering an officer of his own to command in it under the other, and therefore ordered captain carteret to decline the employment, which he prudently, and without noise, did; and thereupon, another officer of the navy, even the surveyor general, captain batten, a man of very different inclinations to his master, and his service, and furious in the new fancies of religion, was substituted in the place: whereas if captain carteret had been suffered to have taken that charge, his interest and reputation in the navy was so great, and his diligence and dexterity in command so eminent, that i verily believe, he would, against whatsoever the earl of warwick could have done, have preserved a major part of the fleet in their duty to the king. finally, in 6.267, describing the queen's coming over from holland with arms in february 1642/43: "the second day after the queen's landing, batten, vice-admiral to the earl of warwick, (who had waited to intercept her passage,) with four the king's ships, arrived in burlington road; and, finding that her majesty was landed, and that she lodged upon the key, bringing his ships to the nearest distance, being very early in the morning [feb. 23], discharged above a hundred cannon (whereof many were laden with cross-bar-shot) for the space of two hours upon the house where her majesty was lodged, whereupon whe was forced out of her bed, some the shot making way through her own chamber; and to shelter herself under a bank in the open fileds; which barbarous and treasonable act was so much the more odious, in that the parliament never so far took notice of it, as to disavow it." ✹ cumsalisgrano on 8 jun 2007 • link captain batten [vice admiral] in his prime when yung peepes still trying to decode aristotle: articles for the surrender of the isle of scilly to the parliament's forces. 1. first, the castle of st. marye's, in silly, and the islands thereof, together with all the forts, fortresses, and other fortifications, as well in trescawe as in that island, belonging to the said garrison, with all their arms, ordnance, ammunition, and furniture of war, and provision, except what shall be allowed in the ensuing articles, shall be delivered to such persons as captain wm. batten vice admiral and colonel richard fortescue shall appoint to receive the same, for the use of king and parliament, without any spoil or embezzlement, upon wednesday the 16th day of this instant september, by two of the clock in the afternoon, or at any time after when it shall be required by the persons authorized as aforesaid. from: 'house of lords journal volume 9: 20 march 1647', journal of the house of lords: volume 9: 1646 (1802), pp. 90-3. url: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compi…. date accessed: 08 june 2007. ✹ bill on 20 aug 2013 • link on the restoration batten was reinstated in his office of surveyor of the navy; in the exercise of its duties his remaining years were passed, during which time, through the pleasant pages of pepys's diary, we seem to become almost personally acquainted with him. pepys was often very much out of humour with batten, though he continued throughout on good terms with him; and much of what we read in the diary must be attributed to some passing pique. to say that in an age of almost universal corruption batten's official hands were not quite clean is unnecessary; but there is something ridiculous in pepys and sir w. warren discoursing on batten's iniquities for some four hours on end, forgetful even of eating or drinking (4 july 1662); or on another occasion adjourning to a tavern to talk 'of the evils the king suffers in our ordering of business in the navy, as sir w. batten now forces us by his knavery' (5 may 1664). the relations of pepys and warren to each other were of such a nature as to permit us to suspect that batten's 'knavery' may have largely shown itself in restraining the greed of the clerk of the acts or in insisting on a just interpretation of the clauses of a contract (e.g. 10 feb. 1662-3, 2 feb. 1663-4, 16 sept. 1664). there is, in fact, no reason to suppose that batten ever exceeded the bounds of what was then considered fair and right; and the story of batten's cowardice (4 june 1664) as related to pepys by coventry, who said he had it from the king, is probably false (29 aug. 1648); though it is quite possible that he may have shown marks of agitation, of a spirit torn with conflicting emotions, which the king thought a fitting subject for jest. in 1665 batten had a serious illness, and lay for four or five days at the point of death. 'i am at a loss,' wrote pepys (7 feb. 1664-5), 'whether it will be better for me to have him die, because he is a bad man, or live, for fear a worse should come.' he revived, however, and lived on for another two years and a half. on 4 oct. 1667 pepys notes: 'sir w. batten is so ill that it is believed he cannot live till to-morrow, which troubles me and my wife mightily, partly out of kindness, he being a good neighbour, and partly because of the money he owes me.' he died on the early morning of 5 oct., 'having been but two days sick;' and on the 12th 'the body was carried, with a hundred or two of coaches, to walthamstow, and there buried.' from 1661 he had sat in parliament as member for rochester, and since june 1663 had held the honourable post of master of the trinity house. he was twice married, and left a son and daughter both grown up and married. ---dictionary of national biography, volume 3, 1885. ✹ bill on 1 apr 2014 • link batten, sir william (d.1667), admiral; obtained letters of marque for the salutation, 1626; surveyor of the navy, 1638; second in command of warwick's fleet, 1642; engaged in preventing assistance king by sea, 1643; resigned command, 1647, but resumed it on personal invitation of officers; joined prince of wales in holland, where he was knighted; declined to serve against parliament and returned; reinstated surveyor of navy, 1660; m.p. for rochester, 1661; master of trinity house, 1663-7. ---dictionary of national biography: index and epitome. s. lee, 1906. ✹ san diego sarah on 30 jun 2016 • link the officers of the corporation of trinity house are elected at the annual meeting each year on trinity day.
