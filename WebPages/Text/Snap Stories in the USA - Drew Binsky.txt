what do you think is the most beautiful place/region in the usa? i vote for northern arizona! .. and it’s a lot more than just the grand canyon! i am lucky to call az my home state, and it’s been a pleasure to explore my own backyard the past week after nearly 10 months abroad. the past 24 hours, my friends and i road tripped to antelope canyon and horseshoe bend, and we had a blast! the views and natural landscapes around northern arizona are so stunning, that they are hard to describe in words .. all i can guarantee is that they will take your breath away. have you ever been to northern arizona? do you agree or disagree with it being the most beautiful place in the country? ‘like’ drew binsky on facebook for more fun travel videos, and make sure to “prioritize” @drewbinsky under “news feed preferences” if you want to see my videos pop up first on your news feeds (the new algorithm change has made it harder for you to see my videos). music: kevin macleod posted by drew binsky on saturday, march 10, 2018 how to see l.a. in 4 hours i’m kicking off my 2 month trip around the usa in one of my favorite cities – los angeles, california! i’ve probably been to l.a. more than any other american city over the last 5 years, but i’m still a tourist every time i come back. this place is huge, diverse, and it has so much to offer — from beautiful beaches, to delicious food to disneyland to nightlife and everything in between. after all, it is the entertainment capital of the world! in today’s video, i meet up with my best friend jake (@jkitaeff), who he gave me an adrenaline-packed tour of l.a. to see how much we could see in just 4 hours. have you ever been to the city of angels? what is your favorite thing to do/see here? ‘like’ drew binsky on facebook for more fun travel videos, and come say hi on insta/snap @drewbinsky 🙂 music: epidemic sound posted by drew binsky on saturday, march 3, 2018 i grew up in a desert… (scottsdale, az) hey guys! i am home right now, in scottsdale, arizona — the place where i grew up for 18 years until moving to wisconsin for college. when i was in high school, i never appreciated how special it is to live here.. the mountains, valleys, desert, sunshine, blue skies and amazing climate. but every time i come back to visit, i am stunned by how perfect it is, especially during the winter season when the rest of the country is frozen! and it’s not only me being biased — ask the 700,000 ‘snowbirds’ who move to phoenix to spend their summers to escape the sub-freezing temperatures in their home states! have you ever been to scottsdale, or arizona in general? maybe the grand canyon? i recommend coming here during this time of the year if you can! ‘like’ drew binsky on facebook, and come say hi on insta/snap @drewbinsky 🙂 music: epidemic sound posted by drew binsky on monday, march 5, 2018 posted by drew binsky on monday, march 12, 2018 there's so much more to see in california… have you ever been to california?
