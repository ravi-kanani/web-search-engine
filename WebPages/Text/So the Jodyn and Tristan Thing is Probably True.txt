hecklerspray grown up gossip & internet villainy so the jodyn and tristan thing is probably true february 21st, 2019 by krysta fitzpatrick here i just was claiming this whole tristan thompson cheated on khloe kardashian with jordyn woods story was 100% fake news, and now half the sisters have unfollowed jordyn on instagram and kylie has kicked her out of the guest house. just when you thought jordyn woods was the ultimate bff to kylie jenner, she has to go out and shove her tongue down constant poon hunter, tristan thompson’s, throat. yuck. kardashian bff larsa pippen recently told tmz that she didn’t think jordyn would have a home at kylie’s much longer and she would totally kick her out. then kim posted a video of her and khloe’s bff malika singing along to songs about bitches finding their own men. i mean, it’s become pretty obvious that the sweet angel we all thought jordyn was was a bit of a facade. that being said, jordyn is 21 and just got hot. she was kylie’s fat baby-faced friend for years and now she’s a bombshell. tristan thompson is an older man who definitely is a snake oil salesman with the ladies, so who knows what manipulative shit he was telling her. i mean, she’s young and probably a bit insecure and dumb. it doesn’t excuse this fuckery, but i’ll honestly be shocked if kylie ditches jordyn altogether. she’d essentially cease having friends. anyway, this whole thing is a sad fucking mess and i actually do feel bad for khloe. i mean, not too bad, but bad. leave a comment cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * notify me of new posts by email. a mediocre rundown of the 2019 oscars so the jodyn and tristan thing is probably true tristan thompson allegedly cheats on khloe kardashian with jordyn woods lil xan is having a kid and i can't deal with that katy perry and orlando bloom are engaged blogroll rumorfix hecklerspray.com copyright © 2019 · · terms · privacy · dmca · contact
