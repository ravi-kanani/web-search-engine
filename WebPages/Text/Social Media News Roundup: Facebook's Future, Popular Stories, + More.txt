(not long after the audio came out, facebook responded by livestreaming an internal q&a session at facebook.) social media news item #2 like counts might be going away on facebook, too you‚Äôve heard about likes going away on instagram ‚Äî perhaps you‚Äôve even experienced it already. well, the same thing is going to happen with like counts on facebook. facebook is officially starting to hid like counts on its posts, starting first in australia. just like with the removal of likes on instagram, with facebook likes, the posts‚Äôs author can still see the count, but it‚Äôs hidden from everyone else who sees it. people can see who liked it but not how many people liked it. same goes for the love, haha, wow, sad, and angry reactions. there‚Äôs been a lot of positive press about these changes for instagram and facebook, especially as it related to people‚Äôs well-being and experience on social media. there‚Äôs less social pressure for a post to perform to a certain threshold ‚Äî less envy, less competition. and to be clear, these hidden like counts are still being treated as tests. a facebook spokesperson told techcrunch, ‚Äúquote‚Äù‚Äúwe are running a limited test where like, reaction, and video view counts are made private across facebook. we will gather feedback to understand whether this change will improve people‚Äôs experiences.‚Äù unquote. the thinking is that if the test improves people‚Äôs well-being without affecting engagement or activity with facebook, then it‚Äôs likely to keep rolling out to more and more countries. we wrote on the buffer blog about this shift away from like counts and what it might mean for marketers. our take is that it signals a move toward attention metrics, which marketers have already been tracking and optimizing for some time now. in fact, i‚Äôd venture to say that marketers were ahead of the curve on this shift away from likes. you‚Äôre right. many social media dashboards now report on these more informative attention metrics, like completion rate for stories video watch time and audience retention referral traffic and attribution engagement rate (total interactions divided by reach) these give you a great signal of whether or not your content is working and keeping people engaged. it‚Äôs much clearer data than an ambiguous response of a like. social media news item #3 pinterest debuts catalog uploads and new business profile features all year long, pinterest has been releasing a ton of great value to businesses and advertisers through new features on the app. the company went public earlier this year and continues to grow, most recently surpassing 300 million monthly active users. what caught our eye with pinterest‚Äôs most recent moves was its addition of more business features and e-commerce features with catalogues, profiles, and shopping. let‚Äôs start with the catalogs. as of a couple weeks ago, if you‚Äôre an e-commerce company, you can upload your full catalog to pinterest and automatically turn all your products into shoppable product pins. this feature was first rolled out to select partners in european countries and is likely to expand further as shopping season nears. the interesting signal that this news tells me is just how committed pinterest is to creating an awesome shopping experience on the app. you‚Äôre right. we‚Äôve seen similar with instagram checkout, which lets you buy directly in the app. it feels like both pinterest and instagram are moving in the same e-commerce direction. if your brand sells to consumers online, then these two social networks will be key places for you. in addition to catalogs, pinterest also debuted new dynamic business profiles with video cover images and a dedicated shop tab. we‚Äôll share a couple examples of these new profiles in our show notes at buffer.com/podcast so you can check them out. i think they look fabulous. the new shop tab is one of my favorite new parts of the profile. it‚Äôll appear just under the main cover image and description, next to the options for activity and community.on the shop tab, you‚Äôll see a list of ‚Äúshop the look‚Äù pins for your brand, even sorted into collections. the ulta beauty account is a great example ‚Äî they have collections for things like nail polish, eye makeup, and accessories. social media news item #4 which is most popular: stories on instagram, facebook, or snapchat? survey says: facebook. (!?) this news comes from our friends at hubspot who recently shared some interesting findings on the popularity of stories. their survey showed that 70 percent of people prefer to watch facebook stories over instagram stories or snapchat. isn‚Äôt that result suprising? now, before you go out and change your whole social media strategy, let me share a bit more context. the data had a small sample size ‚Äî 275 people ‚Äî and the demographics were a broad set of consumers in the united states alone. so had the survey been larger or more focused on a segment like 18-24 year-olds or even 25-34-year olds, we might have seen different results. nevertheless, the fact that facebook stories scored so highly in this survey is a surprise ‚Ä¶ especially when you consider that facebook stories are mostly an afterthought in many marketing articles and strategy conversations. from my point of view, this data made me think twice about facebook stories as a viable channel. it‚Äôs definitely hard to ignore the reach and size of facebook in general, so it makes sense that its stories might be visible to an equally large number of people. and especially if facebook stories are talked about less than, say, instagram stories or snapchat, it feels like competition might be a bit less, too, and you‚Äôll have more chance to stand out. right, and the hubspot article even goes on to describe some easy ways to test the water on facebook stories. a lot of companies take the lean approach: they simply cross-post the same content from instagram stories to facebook stories. doesn‚Äôt get much simpler than that! lightning round pinterest has a dark mode now! you can toggle on the dark mode in the pinterest app. i know a lot of people love this for the way it saves their eyes. even more good news, there‚Äôs a dark mode for gmail now, too. new twitter timelines are here. you can now use twitter lists as alternate twitter home feed timelines. you can pin up to five lists to your main screen then swipe back and forth to see them. we‚Äôre huge fans of twitter lists here at buffer, so this feature has been a real hit. instagram announced the release of threads. threads is a new camera-first messaging app to connect you with your friends. people are calling it another way that instagram has taken inspiration from some of the features that snapchat has built successfully. we‚Äôre eager to see how it performs for instagram. ‚Äúfollowing activity‚Äù goes away. also, instagram recently changed its app so that you can non longer see‚Äúfollowing activity‚Äù tab where it would show you the activity ‚Äî likes, comments, etcetera ‚Äî of the people you followed. how to say hello to us we would all love to say hello to you on social media ‚Äì especially twitter! heather-mae on twitter dave on twitter thanks for listening! feel free to connect with our team at buffer on twitter, buffer on facebook, our podcast homepage, or with the hashtag #bufferpodcast. enjoy the show? it‚Äôd mean the world to us if you‚Äôd be up for giving us a rating and review on itunes! about the science of social media podcast the science of social media is your weekly sandbox for social media stories, insights, experimentation, and inspiration. every monday (and sometimes more) we share the most cutting-edge social media marketing tactics from brands and influencers in every industry. if you‚Äôre a social media team of one, business owner, marketer, or someone simply interested in social media marketing, you‚Äôre sure to find something useful in each and every episode. it‚Äôs our hope that you‚Äôll join our 27,000+ weekly itunes listeners and rock your social media channels as a result! the science of social media is proudly made by the buffer team. feel free to get in touch with us for any thoughts, ideas, or feedback. originally written oct 14, 2019. last updated oct 14, 2019 share with buffer heather-mae pusztai loving the remote work life as customer engagement and #bufferpodcast co-host @buffer follow https://twitter.com/heather_mae_day related articles the best instagram stories of 2019 the science of social media why social commerce will rule social media in 2020 the science of social media brand secrets for standing out in a crowded world the science of social media the newest black friday + cyber monday ideas for your social media marketing the science of social media 80,000+ social media marketers trust buffer see all case studies about us our team feedback contact us tweet @ us press faq guides & tutorials case studies webinars what is social media marketing? the pro plan buffer for business buffer for nonprofits pricing pablo image creator iphone & ipad app android app browser extension apps & extras ¬© 2020 buffer inc. we're hiring hi there, we use cookies to offer you a better browsing experience and to analyze site traffic. by continuing to use our website, you consent to the use of these cookies. learn more. got it
