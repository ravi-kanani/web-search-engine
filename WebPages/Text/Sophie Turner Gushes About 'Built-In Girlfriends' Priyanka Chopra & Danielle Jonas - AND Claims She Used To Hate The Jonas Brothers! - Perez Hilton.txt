home › sophie turner › sophie turner gushes about ‘built-in girlfriends’ priyanka chopra & danielle jonas — and claims she used to hate the jonas brothers! sisters are forever! sophie turner is singing her praises for danielle jonas and priyanka chopra jonas (aka her fellow j-sisters) for her elle cover story, proving once more that their relationship is so special!! related: you’ll swoon over joe jonas’ sweet birthday message for sophie turner she explained to the outlet: “it’s also nice to have built-in girlfriends who are actually really cool, who i can hang out with and we can really talk to each other about, like, how crazy the boys’ lives are.” luckily, there is no in-law drama here! the game of thrones alum added: “we can relate on so many different levels. it’s like, thank god, because you never know [how your in-laws will be].” she went on to praise priyanka, who wed nick jonas in a lavish ceremony in december 2018: “with pri, especially, it’s kind of crazy. you have to remind yourself that she’s basically had a 20-year career in bollywood already. she’s like the biggest thing in india right now. when we went there for her and nick’s wedding, we were treated like royalty. they worship her over there. it’s kinda crazy. but she’s just the nicest person, and they live, like, 10 minutes away.” even though kevin jonas and his longtime love danielle live in new jersey with their two daughters, it doesn’t stop them from enjoying plenty of quality family time: “and even though kevin and danielle live in new jersey, we see them all the time. it’s like we’re all one big family, because the boys are best friends.” aside from her sisters, the sansa stark portrayer obviously gushed about the person who brought her into the family: her husband joe jonas. speaking about married life, she mused: “i feel like the only thing that’s changed for me is having this incredible sense of security. just the word husband and the word wife—it just solidifies the relationship. i love being married. i think it’s wonderful. i’m sure we’ll have our hiccups and our different things. but right now, it’s like the security and the safety is everything.” so sweet! but ironically, she was not a fan of the jonas brothers growing up! turner laughed while explaining: “my friends and i were not jonas brothers fans. there was this band in the uk called busted. they had a hit called year 3000. it was amazing, and we were huge busted fans. then the jonas brothers covered the song and made it massive. and busted broke up. we thought it was all the jonas brothers’ fault. so we hated them.” as you’re likely aware, rumors began to spread recently that sophie and joe were expecting their first child together, but it has yet to be officially confirmed. we’ll keep you posted when the twosome confirms the happy news!! after all, that’s what we really want to know! take a look at her cover and spread (below): view this post on instagram feeling so lucky to have two elle covers out on the very same day. @arthurelgort is a master at his craft and one of the most lovely people i’ve worked with. @louisvuitton and @nicolasghesquiere as usual coming through with the most divine clothes that i wish i could live in forever!
