established 1603 operated by the royal parks public transit access st james's park, green park, victoria, and westminster tube stations st james's park is a 23-hectare (57-acre) park in the city of westminster, central london. it is at the southernmost tip of the st james's area, which was named after a leper hospital dedicated to st james the less. it is the most easterly of a near-continuous chain of parks that includes (moving westward) green park, hyde park, and kensington gardens.[1][2][3] the park is bounded by buckingham palace to the west, the mall to the north, horse guards to the east, and birdcage walk to the south. it meets green park at queen's gardens with the victoria memorial at its centre, opposite the entrance to buckingham palace. st james's palace is on the opposite side of the mall. the closest london underground stations are st james's park, green park, victoria, and westminster.[2] the park is grade i listed on the register of historic parks and gardens.[4] contents 1 features 2 history 3 gallery 4 references 5 external links features audio description of st james's park by alison steadman. duck island cottage has a long history and is now the headquarters for the london parks & gardens trust the park has a small lake, st james's park lake, with two islands, west island and duck island, the latter named for the lake's collection of waterfowl. a resident colony of pelicans has been a feature of the park since a russian ambassador donated them to charles ii in 1664.[5] while most of the birds' wings are clipped, there is a pelican who can be seen flying to the london zoo in hopes of another meal.[6] the blue bridge across the lake affords a tree-framed view west towards buckingham palace. looking east, the view includes the swire fountain to the north of duck island and, past the lake, the grounds of horse guards parade, with horse guards, the old war office and whitehall court behind. to the south of duck island is the tiffany fountain on pelican rock; and past the lake is the foreign and commonwealth office, with the london eye, the shell tower, and the shard behind.[2] the park has a children's playground including a large sandpit.[7] history in 1532, henry viii purchased an area of marshland through which the tyburn flowed from eton college. it lay to the west of york palace acquired by henry from cardinal wolsey; it was purchased in order to turn york palace, subsequently renamed whitehall, into a dwelling fit for a king. on james i's accession to the throne in 1603, he ordered that the park be drained and landscaped, and exotic animals were kept in the park, including camels, crocodiles, an elephant and exotic birds, kept in aviaries.[8] while charles ii was in exile in france under the commonwealth of england, he was impressed by the elaborate gardens at french royal palaces, and on his ascension he had the park redesigned in a more formal style, probably by the french landscaper andré mollet. a 775-metre by 38-metre (850 by 42-yard) canal was created as evidenced in the old plan. the king opened the park to the public and used the area to entertain guests and mistresses, such as nell gwyn. the park became notorious at the time as a meeting place for impromptu acts of lechery, as described by john wilmot, 2nd earl of rochester in his poem "a ramble in st james's park".[9] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries cows grazed on the park, and milk could be bought fresh at the "lactarian", described by zacharias conrad von uffenbach in 1710.[10] the 18th century saw further changes, including the reclamation of part of the canal for horse guards parade and the purchase of buckingham house (now buckingham palace) at the west end of the mall, for the use of queen charlotte in 1761. further remodelling in 1826–27, commissioned by the prince regent (later george iv) and overseen by the architect and landscaper john nash, saw the canal's conversion into a more naturally-shaped lake, and formal avenues rerouted to romantic winding pathways. at the same time, buckingham house was expanded to create the palace, and marble arch was built at its entrance, whilst the mall was turned into a grand processional route. it opened to public traffic 60 years later in 1887. the marble arch was moved to its current location at the junction of oxford street and park lane in 1851 and the victoria memorial was erected between 1906 and 1934. gallery andré mollet's design for the park in charles ii's time, before 18th and 19th century remodelling, which shaped a more

for locket stands where gardens once did spring and wild ducks quack where grasshoppers did sing." ... waller describes in pretty if somewhat languid and diffuse verse his vision of the charms of completed st james's, -- the groves with lovers walking in their amorous shade; the gallants dancing by the river's side, where they bathe in summer and in winter slide; the crystal lake in which a shoal of silver fishes glide, while laden anglers make the fishes and the men their prize. ---london, past and present. h.b. wheatley, 1891. ✹ bill on 20 jun 2013 • link london: the old horse guards from st james's park. canaletto, 1749. http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/canaletto/london-… log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 feb 3 mar 7 jun 6 9 jul 22 sep 16 oct 11 1661 mar 9 apr 2 aug 17 18 sep 4 1662 mar 16 apr 6 may 11 jul 27 sep 21 29 dec 1 8 15 22 1663 jan 25 feb 2 8 mar 9 13 apr 10 may 4 10 15 jun 19 21 22 24 29 30 jul 27 aug 13 1664 jan 4 feb 22 24 mar 28 apr 19 22 25 26 may 2 29 jun 2 10 21 24 jul 7 18 20 aug 11 26 1665 jan 3 feb 27 apr 10 18 jul 5 aug 21 nov 27 1666 jan 6 feb 11 18 28 mar 28 apr 1 13 15 22 may 4 jun 4 6 jul 15 23 25 27 aug 1 8 15 29 sep 2 nov 19 dec 16 1667 jan 20 23 27 feb 3 17 24 mar 3 17 24 apr 4 7 22 26 may 1 5 11 27 28 jun 3 aug 5 9 sep 8 10 23 oct 6 13 28 dec 24 27 1668 feb 18 mar 6 15 apr 4 6 28 may 4 13 20 27 jun 4 jul 6 aug 30 sep 18 27 oct 12 nov 20 dec 27 1669 jan 13 15 mar 3 15 31 apr 11 13 may 24 28 maps see all places in this category on one map latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
