to catch a cat: how three stray kittens rescued me (book review) → stylish multipurpose cat furniture posted on september 9, 2016 by tamar kate in her “catified” work space when i found out my friend kate benjamin, of the well known website hauspanther, had designed a line of cat furniture i was thrilled! if you didn’t already know, kate is one of the authors of the book, “catification: designing a happy and stylish home for your cat (and you!).” i myself am a huge proponent of ensuring your home reflects your personal style while taking into account the needs of feline family members (check out my proper posts about decorating with cats). this new line of cat shelves, beds and scratchers comes in white and espresso. what i love most about these pieces – besides how discrete and sleek they are – is how smartly they’ve been designed. most of the pieces have multiple uses, and all take into account cat behavior. read on to learn about a limited time offer where you can get a 10% discount on your order while another 10% is donated to the jackson galaxy foundation! the wall mounted cat scratcher (far left in above photo), is not only a space saver, but has a replaceable sisal scratcher, a place for your kitty to perch and a dangling toy for stimulation. but wait, that’s not all! the top opens up to reveal storage space for kitty toys! the “double decker” cat bed hideaway is great for multi-cat families, and the open design takes into consideration a feline’s need to always have an escape route! cat shelves have padded lounging areas as well as toys for stimulation and/or scratching surfaces! if you purchase any of these pieces between now and september 15, 2016, you’ll receive 10% off your order plus and an additional 10% will be donated to the jackson galaxy foundation. just use the code jgf10 at check out! we’d love to hear what you think of these pieces and which you’re most excited about or think your feline family members would love most! what else would you like to see kate design?! this entry was posted in cats, reviews and tagged cat bed, cat shelves, decorating with cats, modern cat shelves. bookmark the permalink. ← a giveaway for you and your cat!
