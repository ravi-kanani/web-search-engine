(as a matter of fact it was niall kilmartin’s wife, so if this whole thing sounds familiar to you, niall, that’s why.) she and i came up with a few more: we are the first society in which parents can reasonably expect all their children to outlive them. we are the first society in which an emigrant to a far country can reasonably expect to visit and be visited by their relatives in the old country. we are the first society in which the conversation is global. the coming of the telegraph was the greatest jump in speed of communication that has ever occurred and, barring one of the least scientifically plausible tropes of science fiction turning out to be true after all, will ever occur. the telephone, radio and the internet merely finished the job. we thought of a few more, but those were the biggest ones that i remember. do you have any more? do you disagree with any of those suggestions, or with professor runciman’s idea of the old outnumbering the young quoted earlier? or is the whole idea that we are significantly different from the people of the past merely a childish manifestation of the desire to make ourselves seem special? december 17th, 2019 | 34 comments -

(comments are closed) we owe the relatives of murder victims our compassion but not our belief natalie solent (essex) · middle east & islamic · personal views · self defence & security · sui generis · uk affairs saturday’s daily mail carries this headline: ‘he’s a fraud’: father of london bridge terror victim jack merritt blasts boris johnson for making ‘political capital’ out of son’s death – and backs jeremy corbyn after tv debate the article continues, the father of a man killed in the london bridge terror has slammed boris johnson for trying to ‘make political capital’ over his death. david merritt said the prime minister was a ‘fraud’ for using the attack as justification for a series of tougher criminal policies in a post on social media. his son jack merritt, 25, was one of two people killed by convicted terrorist usman khan at a prisoner reform meeting in fishmongers’ hall last friday. what bitter irony that the two young people usman khan murdered believed strongly that criminals like him could change for the better. because jack merritt and saskia jones were attending a conference on rehabilitation of offenders alongside khan they were the nearest available targets for his knives. no doubt khan planned it that way. one of the consistent aims of islamists is to sow distrust for muslims among non-muslims. david merritt has suffered the cruellest blow imaginable. nothing is more natural than that he should strive to counter the narrative that the ideals for which his son strove are disproved by the manner of his murder. it is, of course, right to say that the ideal of rehabilitation is not disproved by one failure. no policy is proved or disproved by individual cases. let us not forget that james ford, one of the men who bravely fought to subdue khan, was a convicted murderer on day-release. however while khan’s example of terrorist rehabilitation gone wrong does not prove that it can never go right, it is a data point. thankfully we do not have many data points for the graph of jihadists playing a long game. but that means the ones we do have weigh comparatively heavily. what khan did others can copy. the prime minister and those who make policy on parole and rehabilitation of prisoners must assess that possibility. they cannot allow what jack merritt would have wanted or what would ease david merritt’s pain to factor in their decision. in 2001 i wrote a pamphlet for the libertarian alliance called rachel weeping for her children: understanding the reaction to the massacre at dunblane (pdf, text). when discussing massacres carried out by muslims with a libertarian audience it is worth bringing up the subject of massacres carried out by gun owners, because our prejudices are likely to run in a different direction. we are better protected from the temptation to make group judgements. there are other common factors in how we should strive to think rationally about these two sorts of mass killing as well. in 2001 i wrote how the agony of the bereaved parents of those children preyed on my mind. i would have done anything to comfort them – except believe what i knew to be untrue. when the parents of the dunblane children spoke there was every reason for the world to hear about their terrible experience. there was never any particular reason to suppose that their opinions were right. in fact their opinions should carry less weight than almost anyone else’s should. this point is well understood when it comes to juries. it goes without saying, or, at least, it once did, that guilt or innocence must be decided by impartial people. decisions of policy require the same cast of mind as decisions of guilt and innocence. the relatives of murder victims cannot be impartial. in a murder trial it is no use saying that it is as important to the family of the victim as to the judge that no innocent person be punished. in pure logic it ought to be, but in fact it almost never is. the bereaved want to believe that the evildoer has been punished. if the real evildoer has escaped (either escaped in the literal meaning of the word or escaped by suicide, as hamilton did) someone must be found to suffer. even in cases of pure accident we don’t have acts of god any more: always some arm of government or business is pursued and sued so that the weight of blame may fall on somebody. december 8th, 2019 | 18 comments - (comments are closed) tactical voting websites and my microwave oven natalie solent (essex) · science & technology · sui generis · uk affairs “tactical voting sites have spread confusion and animosity. in fact, we don’t need them”, writes dan davies in the guardian. “we” here means remainers who seek to know whether voting labour or liberal democrat is the best way to stop boris johnson’s conservatives winning the election and enacting brexit. but never mind all that. if you want to dally with those old flirts, the opinion polls, i have a post up at the great realignment. back in the world of things, mr davies indirectly described why modern microwave ovens are so much more annoying than the ones from twenty or thirty years ago. consider my microwave. it is a samsung ms28j5215, you will be thrilled to learn. it has a healthy cooking button (never use), a my plate button (not my cup of tea), a power defrost button (like in power rangers), a soften/melt button (my feelings towards it haven’t), a plate warming button (i can never find the plastic thingy that you put the plates on), a deodorisation button (i do sometimes clean the microwave, actually), a child lock button (useless, the microwave is too small to hold a child), a turntable on/off button (it does? gosh, i wish i’d known), a stop/eco button (i do sometimes stop the machine but i do not eco it), a start/+30s button (great, love this button, nukes stuff for 30 seconds) and finally a microwave button. the inclusion of the latter is odd in the same way as the inclusion of death among the four horsemen of the apocalypse is odd. as either neil gaiman or terry pratchett said somewhere, when you’ve got death on the roster, the exact career roles of famine, pestilence and war are worryingly hard to define. about a quarter of a century ago we sought to buy a microwave for my father. he was a widower and had lost touch with modern technology. if he was going to use it at all it had to be very, very simple. stephen hawking used to say that his publishers warned him that every extra equation he put in a brief history of time would halve the sales of the book. it was like that with every extra button or program on a microwave and my dad’s likelihood of ever using the thing. eventually, the proprietor of a little independent electrical goods store in swansea found a dusty little box in the back room that, wonder of wonders, contained a microwave he had probably given up on ever selling. it had two dials, how hot and how long. it was a good microwave. my father did use it. as dan davies writes, the underlying problem seems to be that in the online political era, clever and enthusiastic people seem to choose projects based on what might go viral rather than what really needs to be done. because nobody really needs one of these websites, let alone three or four competing ones. anyone who can understand the concept of tactical voting and why they might want to do it is equal to the very easy task of doing their own research (the tactical.vote website even tells you how, in 200 words). people who don’t want to vote tactically usually have their own, often strongly felt, reasons for not switching to labour or the lib dems. the idea that there is someone out there who would vote tactically if they could just get a convenient packaged recommendation is basically a myth; such people are really rare. in online conversations with people who volunteer for these projects, the only case i’ve really heard for them is that they might be helpful if your grandparents ask you how to vote, which is clearly a hopeful daydream. it’s the dumb thing that smart people always do – assuming that the only reason other people haven’t done what you want is that you haven’t explained it to them yet. unfortunately, politics doesn’t really work like that. november 30th, 2019 | 24 comments -
