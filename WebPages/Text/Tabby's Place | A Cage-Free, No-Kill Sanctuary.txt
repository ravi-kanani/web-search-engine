we’re anxious. but we want you to know that, amid all the uncertainty around novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2), tabby’s place is here for the cats – and for you. although we’re grateful that cats (and other companion animals) are not at risk from the disease, we’re every bit as concerned about the humans who love them. in these troubling times, we encourage you to find a little oasis of peace at the tabby’s place blog and facebook page. (we’ve even posted a blog about tabby’s place’s unique response to covid-19; check it out here.) we promise to continue providing uplifting stories and photos of the cats you love. you mean the world to us, and we hope tabby’s place will be a virtual sanctuary for you. we’re also taking significant steps to minimize the impact of the outbreak on our (feline and human) population. since the appearance of covid-19 in new jersey, we have escalated our daily disinfection protocol modified our activities to support a schedule for minimal on-site staff recruited a small group of volunteers to help with essential duties, while discontinuing all other volunteering closed to the public except by appointment stockpiled essential supplies, food and medications you can read tabby’s place’s full emergency response plan here. for reliable information on the covid-19 pandemic and how you can best protect yourself and your family, we encourage you to consult the websites for the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and the world health organization (who). the cdc has especially helpful guidance for people with pets who may become quarantined. if you are quarantined at home, your cats can and should safely remain there with you, although it is ideal to have another family member care for them while you are symptomatic. now is also a wise time to arrange for trusted friends or family to care for your cats in the event that you are hospitalized. ultimately, tabby’s place is tackling covid-19 much the same way we do everything: we’re taking care of each other (of all species). we all need each other, and love is going to carry us through all the days we can’t yet see. now and always, you are very dear to us. warmly, the tabby’s place humans & cats × tabby’s place opened its doors 15 years ago … … and changed the world for cats … we’re about to do it again learn more x tabby's place opened its doors 15 years ago ... … and changed the world for cats … we’re about to do it again learn more x
