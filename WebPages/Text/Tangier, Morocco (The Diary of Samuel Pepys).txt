"private men lived on a diet of ship's biscuit, salt beef or pork, dried peas, butter, cheese and oatmeal, with the occasional variety of fresh bread and dried fish. the provisions were sent to tangier from england by contractors who purchased their rights from the lord's commissioners for tangier, but even if the correct amount was shipped there was no guarantee that the stores would reach their destination. victualling vessels could be shipwrecked during the three week r voyage through the stormy bay of biscay, or captured by corsairs, as happened to the phoenix in 1677." the army of charles ii by j.childs ✹ pedro on 5 may 2007 • link may 4th 1664 on may 4th a composite battalion of 500 men, commanded by the governor (teviot) marched towards jews hill, 2 or 3 miles out of tangier. once on jews river, teviot met a force of 3,000 moors, and these he beat off. it seems the advance was a calculated risk... after repulsing the first attack, teviot was sufficiently confident to advance further inland... but he was moving into a trap. the moor's first attack had been a decoy luring the british into a heavy wooded upland where another 8000 lay hidden. unable to assume their stylised order of battle, the british were defeated in clusters of hand to hand fighting where pikes and hangers were no match for scimitars. teviot rallied his battalion at the summit of jews hill where they were cut down to a man. 30 out of the original 500 escaped to tangier.
