reply linda says: october 10, 2019 at 1:56 am please see, drew is misinformed. you do not need a tefl for teaching in south korea. it is better, if you want, to get a celta degree which is recognized around the world and is required in many countries. a tefl is basically wasting your money. there are too many companies that offer them,and schools know that they are money making schemes. the celta is from cambridge. it is the diamond. but to teach in south korea you do not need anything except a 4 year degree. but drew gets money from each tefl memebership he sells. reply mike cassidy says: december 26, 2019 at 11:37 pm i agree with you. so many people now know that drew goldberg has tricked so many students and used the money to see the world. i lost respect for him because of his lie. nobody needs the worthless certificate and yet he still gets cash from the students who trust him. reply vickie edwards says: february 1, 2020 at 9:39 pm from what i have seen, this guy partied in school, studied business, and now is wanting to portray himself as a reliable and trustworthy leader in the travel industry. the truth is that he had to use tricks to get his travel money. anyone with money can travel. he pretends to be wanting to help people but in reality he just uses people, and is clueless. reply jessica hill says: july 25, 2018 at 2:44 pm great post breaking down tefl! reply sunil shrestha says: july 8, 2018 at 12:58 pm drew was very young in the picture. i am a big fan of yours and don‚Äôt miss your travel videos. you are a great traveler. best of luck. reply professor martin says: april 8, 2018 at 11:13 pm hi drew, can i download you documnent about teaching in korea?

i want to teach as an english teacher in korea. üôÅ i hope you can help me. thank you! reply hishal says: march 20, 2018 at 9:29 pm hi drew your guide of teaching in korea which says 7000 words. i can‚Äôt see please can you check that. i‚Äôm considering to go either to korea or china reply mark says: march 17, 2018 at 12:40 pm hi drew i have a 120 hour tefl certificate, but how strict are they on the degree thing? i have a 2 year it diploma but very few people from 3rd world countries, like me (south africa), have the opportunity to attend university. in fact only 1% of the population of earth have tertiary education of any kind, so it would seem odd if this was a strict requirement as they would struggle to find teachers. do you know if they are lenient on this if you interview well? loving the blog and thanks for all the info! reply kimberly becvar-valdemira says: february 3, 2018 at 4:20 pm hi drew, i found you through something joel comm posted on facebook. i‚Äôm currently a special education teacher in new york. although i‚Äôm not ready to take the full time traveler plunge (yet), i was wondering if there are any short term assignments that are out there. here‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking‚Ä¶dip pinky toe in for a summer, then take a sabbatical where i‚Äôd be able to commit to a 14 month deal and see what happens from there. reply tonya chen says: february 3, 2018 at 11:55 pm drew, i must agree that teaching english in korea is one of the best experiences in my life as well! i wouldn‚Äôt trade my time there for anything. kimberly, it will be hard finding short term assignments in korea. contracts are usually for 12 months. sometimes during winter and summer they have short-term camps but usually they want teachers who are already in south korea with proper visas. it never hurts to ask though! check out http://worknplay.co.kr/ or craigslist seoul for these camps. best of luck! reply clear signs says: january 23, 2018 at 3:37 pm some really nice stuff on this website, i really enjoy it. reply david says: january 15, 2018 at 5:11 am hey drew, love all your posts man but i can‚Äôt seem to get into any of your old blog posts for thehungrypartier.com is the website gone? reply danielle says: january 9, 2018 at 1:33 am is your blog ‚Äúhungry partier‚Äù deactivated or did you take it down? it says the site cannot be found when i click on it, and i‚Äôm extremely interested in reading about your experience of teaching abroad there as i‚Äôm hoping to go there myself and would love your insights and tips you have. reply maggie says: november 2, 2017 at 12:30 am hey drew! i know you‚Äôre in the middle of drake passage right now but when you get a chance, i as well would like to know if there is an updated promo code for the tefl course. they have a pretty solid promotion going right now but i‚Äôd like to support you when buying the course. thanks! have fun in antarctica! reply maggie says: november 2, 2017 at 12:42 am oops, never mind it‚Äôs working! reply pingback: the world is drew binsky's playground, join his global party - metiza justin squirewell says: september 5, 2017 at 1:51 pm the code drew is expired. is there a way to get another code reply maggie says: november 2, 2017 at 12:40 am it worked for me once i entered the drew in all caps! hopefully it works for you as well! reply willy says: june 3, 2017 at 11:03 am is it really required to hold a passport from an english speaking country to teach english as a foreign language? i‚Äôm dutch and was planning on teaching english in asia after graduation, but now i‚Äôm wondering how strict they really are when it comes to the passport requirement. i could still try get a uk passport (before brexit) as i have family there, but it would be a lot of trouble. reply drew binsky says: june 6, 2017 at 7:38 pm yes it‚Äôs required in most companies, however, you can be a private tutor in almost all countries that don‚Äôt speak english, which often pays as much (or more) than contracted jobs! reply manon wintjes says: may 25, 2017 at 1:44 am thanks this was interested. im nowearing in china working as a aupair in the family i also need to learn the oldest daughter english. reply drew binsky says: may 25, 2017 at 4:36 pm which part of china?
