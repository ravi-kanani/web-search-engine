(comments are closed) we are all good comrades now thaddeus tremayne (london) · activism · russia as far as i know, it was my very good friend sean gabb who first posited a theory about who may be responsible for the hacking of the cru e-mails that have now formed the basis of ‘climategate’: in short, i believe the russians are behind this. it may be that all those megabytes of data were stolen by a computer hacker. there may be any number of people who are up to such hacking in the technical sense. but this seems to have been an integrated operation. having the technical skills to get access to a computer archive is not the same as knowing where to look in that archive and what to look for. nor is it the same as knowing what to do with it. but the russians had means and opportunity to do the job. perhaps their security services are no longer as efficient and as well-funded as in soviet times. but they are still there. their mission is no longer to win the cold war. but making life easier for mr putin and his friends is a large mission in itself. i have no idea whether or not there is any truth in this. certainly the russian state has plenty of motivation but then so do a host of others. sean offers very little in the way of evidence because there is very little in the way of evidence. but, interestingly, there are some tufts of corroboration emerging: suspicions were growing last night that russian security services were behind the leaking of the notorious british ‘climategate’ emails which threaten to undermine tomorrow’s copenhagen global warming summit. an investigation by the mail on sunday has discovered that the explosive hacked emails from the university of east anglia were leaked via a small web server in the formerly closed city of tomsk in siberia. have they merely read and then embellished sean’s article i wonder? or is there some flickering fire to accompany this smoke? the evidence is, at best, circumstantial. but what if it does turn out to have been the former kgb? would it not be an irony of historic proportions that an organisation formerly devoted to establishing a global tyrrany has thrown a big hammer-and-sickle into the works of their would-be successors? and, not just ironic, but also just. because if the warm-mongers get their way, then it is not the powerful and the well-connected that need fear their zealotry. the al gores and zac goldsmiths of the world can afford to bask in the green glow of personal glory, safe in the knowledge that their opulent lifestyles will not be compromised by so much a sterling silver napkin ring. they will soar (both literally and metaphorically) above it all. no, it is the average joe/jane who will be forced to endure the austerity that their new overlords will demand. it is those who struggle to make ends meet who will be told that the planet can no longer afford their humble family saloon or their two weeks a year in the algarve. it is the little people who will be stepped upon because they can be stepped upon. maybe, one day, we will know the true identity of the e-mail hackers. or maybe we will never know. but i do sort of hope that it does turn out to be some guy called yvgeny, acting on orders from the kremlin, tapping away in a windowless room in a drab building on a military base in krasnoyarsk because then, we will be able to say: congratulations, tovarisch! you have, at long last, established yourself as a hero of the proletariat. december 6th, 2009 | 34 comments - (comments are closed) minarets ‘r’ not us thaddeus tremayne (london) · european affairs · middle east & islamic the result is in: the swiss public has voted in favour of a proposition prohibiting the construction of any new minarets in their country. note: this is not a ban on islam or even the construction of mosques, just minarets. aside from all the obvious reprecussions (which are not hard to predict), it does occur to me that this raises an interesting and very thorny questions for libertarians because this is not a straightforward case of state repression. in fact, it appears that both the swiss government and parliament were firmly opposed to the proposition which has been put to the public by referendum following a petition which was endorsed by a sufficient number of swiss citizens. the swiss state urged the public to reject the proposition but, having lost, is now forced, reluctantly, to change the constitution to enact the minaret ban into swiss law. this was ground-up not top-down. when a government says no to freedom of religious worship, it is easy to mount our high horses and ride forth bearing gleaming swords of indignation. but when a clear majority of the demos say no, well, then it gets rather harder. at least, it does for me. november 29th, 2009 | 187 comments -

(comments are closed) let’s get real thaddeus tremayne (london) · opinions on liberty it has often been said that one of the more important functions of blogs like this is to get ‘memes’ (or ideas, as i prefer to call them) started and then spread around virally. in the spirit, i think it behoves us to begin spreading this idea: that people who work in the public sector should be exempt from having to pay tax. all tax. and, no, i am not proposing to do them a big favour, though expect that many in the public sector will see it as a favour and that is all for the good. no, what i am proposing is the stripping away of a fig-leaf that disguises the very important distinction between tax-payers and tax-consumers. currently, only those who earn their living in the private or voluntary sector are tax-payers and while public sector employees do file tax returns and, on the face of it, pay their taxes too, this is a mere bookkeeping fiction. they are the recipients of tax, adding nothing to the public purse. the number of people who fail to understand this distinction, holding instead that “we are all taxpayers” is alarmingly high. by forcing the public sector to lead tax-free lives, we make their true status not just clearer but undeniable. it is high time that we made it crystal clear as to who bears the burden of taxation and who enjoys the benefit; who produces the wealth and who gets the wealth handed to them. it is a cheap and easy means of dramatically changing the dynamic of all economic and political debate. if you like this idea, then tell someone else. let’s start spreading it. july 26th, 2009 | 23 comments -

(comments are closed) not me thaddeus tremayne (london) · uk affairs gordon brown and his pack of malignant zanulabour jackals do not deserve all this negative sentiment and opprobrium. no, really they don’t. they deserve far worse. i regard zanulabour as just about the worst thing to happen to this country since the black death and i share brian’s manifest and meritorious glee at the now-very-likely prospect of mr. brown (together with his toadies and his cronies and his aunts) being given their marching orders and sent packing off to political obscurity. if we lived in a more civilised world then this story would end with each and every one of them staring up at the glinting, merciless blade of madame guillotine. but we don’t, so i will have to content myself with some sincere and noisy expressions of satisfaction at their demise together with a toast to guido fawkes, who did so much to bring it about. but, what then? what follows next after mr. brown and his minions have been given the big, national elbow? well, in due course (and perhaps even short course) mr. brown will be replaced by mr. not-brown. and what lessons will mr. not-brown have learned from the rise and ignoble fall of mr. brown? he will have learned that you can relentlessly plunder the wealth-producing sector of the economy in order to provide booty for your clients and be regarded as a visionary leader. he will have learned that you can establish a pettyfogging, pecksniffing, bullying surveillance state and be called a great statesman. he will have learned that you can hack at a once-prosperous economy with punitive taxes and onerous regulations until said economy collapses in an anaemic heap and be praised as an economic genius. and, crucially, he will have learned that you can get away with doing all of that, as long as you observe parliamentary protocols and refrain from seeking to smear your political classmates. that is unacceptable. so mr. not-brown has had his very simple manifesto handed to him on a plate, courtesy of his predecessor. all mr. not-brown has to do is to pledge to ‘clean up’ politics and put a stop to all this lack of propriety and he is home and hosed. he doesn’t even have to keep his pledge because everyone will be so relieved that mr. not-brown is not mr. brown that they will believe him. they will want to believe him and so he will get a free pass to do pretty much whatever takes his fancy. all mr. not-brown has to do (for a couple of years at least) is to make sure that his toadies and his cronies and his aunts keep their cards closer to their chests while they get on with what everybody agrees to be the praiseworthy and important business of stamping on our faces. in the fullness of time, mr. not-brown will also be humbled by some scandal or other (brought to light, i am sure, by guido) but by then he will have had his fun and he will shuffle away only to hand the baton of national-ruin over to mr.not-not-brown. i am already celebrating the unfolding zanulabour train wreck and i cannot begin to tell anyone just how pleased i will be to finally see the back of them. but my joy is tempered with the melancholy realisation that a change of government on the basis of sleaze means no real change at all. april 17th, 2009 | 19 comments - (comments are closed) prison island thaddeus tremayne (london) · civil liberty & regulation · uk affairs to date, we have been fortunate. i say that because, given the consistently submissive nature of the british public, we have been blessed (yes, i do mean blessed) with a ruling political class that has been, relatively speaking, both modest in its ambitions and cautious in its actions. if they only realised how much more they could get away with we would, by now, be living in a hell on earth. this is why i say that we, so far, been very lucky. but luck always runs out and i think ours is about to do just that: anyone departing the uk by land, sea or air will have their trip recorded and stored on a database for a decade. passengers leaving every international sea port, station or airport will have to supply detailed personal information as well as their travel plans. so-called “booze cruisers” who cross the channel for a couple of hours to stock up on wine, beer and cigarettes will be subject to the rules. in addition, weekend sailors and sea fishermen will be caught by the system if they plan to travel to another country – or face the possibility of criminal prosecution. the owners of light aircraft will also be brought under the system, known as e-borders, which will eventually track 250 million journeys annually. even swimmers attempting to cross the channel and their support teams will be subject to the rules which will require the provision of travellers’ personal information such as passport and credit card details, home and email addresses and exact travel plans. another database for the sake of it? well, possibly. but i think we all know that it will not stop there. this is, of course, a prelude and a ‘softening up’ process for the eventual introduction of a requirement for exit visas (soviet style). so, a word of advice to any of my compatriots who are planning to emigrate abroad: settle your plans as soon as practicable and make your move within the next 5 years. after that, you may well find that your escape routes have been walled off. march 17th, 2009 | 31 comments -
