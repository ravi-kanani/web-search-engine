take part in a good old riddle showdown. riddles aren’t only fun, but they can help boost your children’s verbal fluency and creative thinking. riddles typically rely on clever new angles to look at something common, or on words with veiled or multiple meanings. so to answer the riddle, your kid needs to know what the words in the riddle mean and their various applications. for example, when you ask, “what has a head, a foot, and four legs?” your kiddo needs to know that the concept of “legs” applies not only to animals but to beds. if they don’t know that, well, the riddle is a way for you to teach them and expand their perspective and vocab. below you’ll find 29 riddles for kids. some of them are classics (“what’s black and white and read all over?”); some may be new to you. there’s also a nice mixture of easy, medium, and hard riddles, so you’ll find puzzles for all ages and abilities here. after you’ve read these, be sure to check out the 54 best jokes for kids of all ages. “riddle: i’m tall when i’m young and i’m short when i’m old. what am i?” answer: a candle. “riddle: where can you find cities, towns, shops, and streets but no people?” answer: a map. “riddle: there is a rooster sitting on top of a barn. if it laid an egg, which way would it roll?” answer: roosters don’t lay eggs. “riddle: what five letter word becomes shorter when you add two letters to it?” answer: short (short+er). “riddle: what is so fragile that saying its name breaks it?” answer: silence. “riddle: what has a bottom at the top?” answer: your legs. “riddle: what has a face and two hands but no arms or legs?” answer: a clock. “riddle: how many months have 28 days?” answer: all 12 of them do. “riddle: what’s black and white and read all over?” answer: a newspaper. “riddle: what word is spelled wrong in every dictionary?” answer: wrong. “riddle: i have no life, but i can die. what am i?” answer: a battery. “riddle: what gets wetter as it dries?” answer: a towel. “riddle: mary has four daughters, and each of her daughters has a brother — how many children does mary have?” answer: five. each daughter has the same single brother. “riddle: you walk into a room which contains a match, a kerosene lamp, a candle, and a fireplace. what would you light first?” answer: the match. “riddle: what has four wheels and flies?” answer: a garbage truck. “riddle: what has 88 keys, but cannot open a single door?” answer: a piano. “riddle: what has a bed but never sleeps, can run but never walks, and has a bank but no money?” answer: a river. “riddle: the more you take the more you leave behind. what are they?” answer: footsteps. “riddle: what is full of holes but still holds water?” answer: a sponge. “riddle: who can shave 25 times a day but still have a beard?” answer: a barber. “riddle: what begins with t, finishes with t, and has “t” in it?” answer: a teapot. “riddle: which weighs more: a pound of feathers or a pound of bricks?” answer: they weigh the same. “riddle: everyone has it and no one can lose it; what is it?” answer: a shadow. “riddle: what goes up but never goes back down?” answer: your age. “riddle: what has one head, one foot, and four legs?” answer: a bed. “riddle: what begins with an e but only has one letter in it?” answer: an envelope. “riddle: i am an odd number. take away a letter and i become even. what number am i?” answer: seven. “riddle: after a train crashed, every single person died. who survived?” answer: all of the couples. “riddle: what gets bigger the more you take away?” answer: a hole. “riddle: three men were in a boat. it capsized, but only two got their hair wet. why?” answer: one was bald. never miss an update subscribe to the aom newsletter daily weekly i agree to the privacy policy terms. want to start taking action on the content you read on aom?
