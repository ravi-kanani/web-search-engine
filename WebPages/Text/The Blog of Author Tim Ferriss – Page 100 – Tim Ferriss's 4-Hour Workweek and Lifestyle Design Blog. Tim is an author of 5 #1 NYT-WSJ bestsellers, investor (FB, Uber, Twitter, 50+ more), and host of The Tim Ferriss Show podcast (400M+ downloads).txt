my guess is that they never planned to continue it past one year or so. it would just be a loss-leading benefit for a brief time to get sign-ups and new members. just an educated guess.] since i live in ca but travel a lot to nyc, i can get four free tickets for friends who want to come with me to nyc on the same itinerary. i can also barter these tickets or trade them on craigslist, which gives me an automatic roi of at least $1,200 on the $300 first year annual fee. if i fly to hawaii from san francisco, which i plan to do soon to train with bj penn, and barter the extra ticket ‚Äì even at a 30% discount on the ‚Äúretail prices‚Äú- the roi will cover my expense while there. 2. free access to over 950 work and meeting spaces around the world coffee shops can get old fast. more that once (especially in buenos aires and paris), i‚Äôve wanted to dropkick the smoker who refuses to go outside and ddt the kid with the ipod on 1,000 decibels. if you really want to see me lose it, surround me with a gaggle of gum-chewing girls on their cell phones. the platinum card gives me an alternative to going postal ‚Äî a remote office to use, complete with gourmet coffee, broadband, printing, and conference rooms. the alternative use that interests me ‚Äî mostly for fun and pranks ‚Äî is getting a mailing address and receptionist in primo locations and then having the mail and calls forwarded to wherever i actually happen to be. want an office on wall street or champs-elysees in paris? next time an investment banker rolls their eyes when you say you‚Äôre an entrepreneur, you can casually mention at the end: ‚Äúnice meeting you. next time you‚Äôre in london or paris, give me a call. we should do lunch near one of my offices. gotta run to the theatre/beach/museum [make sure it‚Äôs around 2pm in the afternoon], but keep in touch!‚Äù ah, the precious moments üòâ more to come as i figure out even better methods for squeezing the most out of this card, my first new one in 3 years. if you have any good ideas, let me know. posted on march 7, 2007january 16, 2020 dozens of previous posts are here 17 comments topics: categoriesthe book - 4hww share this: facebook twitter email reddit print thanks for coming to the new home of the tim ferriss blog! this isn‚Äôt the first one, but i‚Äôm still in the process of deciding which goodies to pull in from the current/older tim ferriss blog. be sure to check it out, as i might leave some reader favorites (‚Äúlosing 10 lbs. of fat in 2 weeks‚Äù, ‚Äúthe px project: how to read 300% faster in 20 minutes‚Äù, ‚Äú5 doping scandal predictions‚Äù, and others) there. now that the book is coming (april 24th!) and i will be able speak more freely, the blog will be getting much, much more exciting and much, much more controversial. there are some big things coming. big. posts navigation previous page page 1 ‚Ä¶ page 99 page 100 join 1.5m+ subscribers and receive exclusive tools, tips, and resources directly from tim: type your email address yes, sign me up for tim's free email newsletter. i agree to the privacy policy. get access twitter instagram facebook youtube linkedin click to subscribe apple podcasts spotify overcast popular podcasts bren√© brown ‚Äî striving versus self-acceptance, saving marriages, and more (#409) how to support healthcare workers now ‚Äî plus urgent suggestions for uber eats, hilton, amazon, and more (#416) jack kornfield ‚Äî how to find peace amidst covid-19, how to cultivate calm in chaos (#414) the top 25 episodes of the tim ferriss show from 2019 most popular pages 11 reasons not to become famous (or ‚Äúa few lessons learned since 2007‚Äù) podcast ‚Äì the tim ferriss show the best books and articles i read in 2019 finding the one decision that removes 100 decisions (or, why i‚Äôm reading no new books in 2020) topics 30-day challenges (2) 4-hour case studies (50) automation (7) comfort challenges (4) dance (3) e-mail detox (23) entrepreneurship (60) fearless (2) filling the void (93) gadgets (15) geoarbitrage (8) interviews (29) investing (18) language (16) low-information diet (42) marketing (54) mental performance (42) mini-retirements (24) muse examples (9) nonsense (5) opening the kimono ‚Äì otk (4) outsourcing life (17) physical performance (51) practical philosophy (39) presentations (3) protecting time (14) psychedelics (14) quarterly shipments (3) random (29) remote offices (7) rockstar living in‚Ä¶ (5) rust and iron (2) science (5) the 4-hour body ‚Äì 4hb (48) the 4-hour chef ‚Äì 4hc (39) the 4-hour chef recipes (1) the book ‚Äì 4hww (44) the slow-carb diet (4) the tim ferriss experiment ‚Äì tfx (11) the tim ferriss show (394) the tim ferriss show transcripts (256) tim ferriss book club (6) tools of titans (8) travel (67) tribe of mentors (10) writing and blogging (35) books by tim ferriss the 4-hour workweek the 4-hour body the 4-hour chef tools of titans tribe of mentors we use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it. see our cookie policy here. sitemap site terms of service privacy policy copyright ¬© 2007‚Äì2020 tim ferriss. the 4-hour¬Æ is a registered trademark of tim ferriss. all rights reserved. privacy policy proudly powered by wordpress | hosted by pressable send to email address your name your email address cancel post was not sent - check your email addresses! email check failed, please try again sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.
