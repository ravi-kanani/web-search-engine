(you have good taste!) naturegirly says: march 6, 2017 at 8:28 pm awesome design! the main reason most cats don’t use a scratcher is because it’s not tall enough. if you stretch a cat out full length they are almost always over two foot tall. the looks to be a perfect size! can’t wait to see how affordable it is. thanks for the early look at it! i have cat says: june 16, 2017 at 7:45 pm agree!!!! i can’t wait to hear more! queencatlady says: march 7, 2017 at 6:57 am pawesome! this is a perfect combo and not ugly for the living room! i have cat says: june 16, 2017 at 7:42 pm agree! i want one! beks says: march 9, 2017 at 1:38 pm cool design, but a ballpark on price would be appreciated before signing up. no one wants spam about something they might not be able to afford. i have cat says: june 16, 2017 at 7:45 pm i wonder if they are still working it out?
