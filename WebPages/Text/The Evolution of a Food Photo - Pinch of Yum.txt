i just switched to shooting in raw with a dslr, so maybe i am doing something wrongâ€¦ love these posts on food photography! 02/18/14 @ 7:10 am reply lindsay yes! i had the same problem and it drove me crazy. the solution was uploading really small sized images so that fg didnâ€™t do any compression. i think they have some kind of auto compression on their site because they have so many photos, so the larger your photo, the more likely that it would be compressed and therefore get some unnatural coloration. i just figured out the exact dimensions and uploaded photos of that size (itâ€™s either 250Ã—250 or 200Ã—200, i canâ€™t remember). 02/18/14 @ 7:13 am reply becky @ a calculated whisk thank you so much!! ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 8:32 am reply lindsay hope that helps! it was seriously the most annoying thing to me for a long time. ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 2:41 pm reply kelly @ hidden fruits and veggies thatâ€™s pretty much how it goes down in my house. only i say them very loudly and josh keeps asking why weâ€™re yelling. 02/18/14 @ 7:24 am reply taylor @ food faith fitness such a great post and so glad to see that i am not the only one, sitting in front of my computer talking at it while my husband looks at me like i am crazy (then again he does that he even when i am not in front of a computerâ€¦.over it.) 02/18/14 @ 7:25 am reply lee ahhh the white bowl! i have so many amazing looking bowls, but when it comes down it it, white always looks the the best ðŸ˜€ love this breakdown. pinning fo sho! 02/18/14 @ 7:47 am reply lindsay white always wins in my book! thanks lee! xo 02/18/14 @ 2:43 pm reply padaek love this post! thank you so much â€“ you and poy team rock. as a newbie food blogger, iâ€™ve found your blog, recipes and photos, etc so inspiring. keep up the awesome work chef! ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 8:03 am reply abby @ the frosted vegan this is totally how it goes for me too! iâ€™m usually trying to work as fast as possible to catch the light before it disappears : ) i canâ€™t wait until summer so i can shoot until 8pm! 02/18/14 @ 8:15 am reply lindsay abby, did you see this post i did on artificial light? i am just thinking of you because i do the same thing with scrambling for the natural light. but maybe this will help in the winter months! 02/18/14 @ 2:43 pm reply kalynskitchen very fun, thanks for sharing. 02/18/14 @ 8:40 am reply prash @ yummilyyours n i thought it was just me who doesnâ€™t get it right with the first photo! i recently started blogging & have been following you for a while now. my food photography has improved tremendously but i go through the same process most of the times and i had begun to wonder if itâ€™s just me! its good to know that you need more than 1 shot and 2 food styles too! thanks lindsay! ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 9:48 am reply quyen nguyen (@liveitinerantly) love this! i blog on the recipes of my travels and these tips are definitely helpful. i usually donâ€™t go through as many changes as you do though! definitely need to pick up more dishes and silverware. http://liveitinerantly.com/ 02/18/14 @ 10:38 am reply bianca @ confessions of a chocoholic too funny, and so true! i found your ebook very useful, thanks for sharing all your tips with us ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 12:10 pm reply caroline i do the same thing! itâ€™s a little different because iâ€™m taking pictures of people as opposed to food so itâ€™s a little less controlled, but i definitely will noticing things in the first photo and make changes â€” either take things out, put something else in, change the angle or camera settings. often times my last photo in a sequence is my favorite for this reason! 02/18/14 @ 12:36 pm reply lindsay yes, exactly! when iâ€™m not sure where to look within a series, i always go to the last one. ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 2:38 pm reply leigha @ minougirl i absolutely love this! sounds exactly like me ðŸ™‚ i donâ€™t think iâ€™ve ever photographed something not in a white dish. quick question: what does editing the curves do? iâ€™m all for white balance and color but iâ€™ve never toyed with curves! i seriously need to buy tasty food photography. i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m waitingâ€¦ all iâ€™ve heard is good things! 02/18/14 @ 12:38 pm reply lindsay curves is really fun â€“ it basically deals with contrast and light. i usually pull up on the middle (lightens it), down a little bit on the left side (defines shadows and contrast a bit more), and then adjust till i like it. for some dark photos i end up pulling up on the shadows a bit. ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 2:37 pm reply danielle @ thecharmitspot great tips on food photography! thanks, love the transformation! 02/18/14 @ 12:54 pm reply diane @ vintage zest i am forwarding this to my guy right now! iâ€™m not the only one who thinks like this! i do scrutinize, but not nearly as much as i should because my photos sometimes come up shortâ€¦ maybe iâ€™ll take an extra minute or two from now on. ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 1:39 pm reply lindsay this was actually over the course of two separate days. that first picture is the set up i was using the first day, and then i ended up not liking any of the final photos which is why i moved to the second set up. it doesnâ€™t usually matter that much to me, but i wanted to have one that i felt good about for the ecookbook. ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 2:35 pm reply matilda @ buttered side down as a total rookie in the food photography game, itâ€™s so interesting to see your process. i tend to take photos from a lot of different angles, but only change my props/background up maybe 2-3x with each dish. iâ€™m also currently stuck with using an old phone camera which is not ideal haha. thanks, as always, for the inspiration! 02/18/14 @ 1:42 pm reply caitlin love it! i definitely do the same thing â€“ but maybe thatâ€™s because i get most of my photo knowledge from your tasty photography ebook? so iâ€™m channeling you a little bit? i actually take most of my pictures while the house is empty so thereâ€™s a lot of mumbling under my breath. and sometimes yelling when the sun doesnâ€™t agree with me. 02/18/14 @ 2:41 pm reply aj quick question for you. are you taking these, uploading them to your computer to view, then going back and making adjustments? or are you doing this via the camera preview screen? i struggle with this type of though process and i think iâ€™m trying to do too much before i start looking at pictures on my computer. thanks for this post!! helpful to see your method! aj 02/18/14 @ 3:05 pm reply lindsay well, both, but i donâ€™t usually tether to my computer and i usually just use the camera screen because my i end up doing more adjustments with composition which i feel like i can get a good feel for just by looking at the screen. lighting is a little more touchy though and i think it helps to view it on your actual computer screen if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re trying to adjust. 02/18/14 @ 6:39 pm reply holly great advice, as always! i really like to see other photographerâ€™s progression of shots as well as the set up. i used your trick of using a cookie sheet for a background on a post i published today. it works great every time! now my next step is to try out editing software. i use picmonkey at the moment but will have to read through your ebook again to gain confidence before trying lightroom or photoshop. 02/18/14 @ 5:31 pm reply francesca i love these posts- they are really helpful. thanks f 02/18/14 @ 5:46 pm reply chris @ the cafÃ© sucrÃ© farine this is a great post lindsay, i do exactly the same thing talking to my husband though as we shoot together. getting the angles of the silverware just right to suit me is sometimes the hardest part of the food styling for me. my husband sometimes goes to sleep while iâ€™m still trying to get it right ðŸ™‚ 02/18/14 @ 5:47 pm reply layla @ brunch time baker ahh.. the adventures of food photography. the things i go through while shooting a photo are unbelievable! sometimes after i shoot like 50 pics and give up i go back with a new approach to photographing the food and it usually all works out in the end! food blogging is all about trial and error and more importantly, taking a ton of pics until you get things right! 02/18/14 @ 5:53 pm reply christina @ the beautiful balance i hope this wonâ€™t be the last of the behind-the-scenes type of posts. i absolutely love your blog and love seeing how you do what you do, since you are beyond amazing. 02/18/14 @ 6:06 pm reply newer comments Â» howâ€™s this for awesome?
