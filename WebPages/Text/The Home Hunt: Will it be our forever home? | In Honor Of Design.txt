(we have the fruit trees we planted to prove it;)) as much as we would love to proclaim we will be in nashville forever, we just know how quickly life can change in a season. we sure hope so though! a few things we are prioritizing for this next home: location ‚Äì we really don‚Äôt want to spend hours in the car every week, so we are searching within the 10 minute radius of where the kids are going to be attending school. unfortunately for us, this is a popular area so home prices are pretty high. in fact, we will almost have to double our mortgage for a house a similar size as our current one. yikes. neighborhood ‚Äì i always thought a horse farm would be dreamy. after experiencing a small neighborhood with wonderful neighborhood friends for my kids though, we realize that this is just a phase of our life where having friendly neighbors and community is more important than a nice big lot! (we were really lucky to have both of those this time around. ) kitchen ‚Äì the place we spend a lot of time as a family is our kitchen and living room area. it was the renovation project i was most looking forward to in our current home, but we won‚Äôt get to make that happen. an open kitchen layout that is conducive to family gatherings is what we are really hoping for. as long as it has potential, i don‚Äôt really care what it looks like. i have a folder full of ideas waiting to be executed;) there is something beautiful about the family table, and gathering around meals. it is why it is something important to gabe and i. basement ‚Äì this is not common in a lot of nashville homes, but in the midwest where we both grew up it was! are basements common in your area? for us, it has been a saving grace as far as having a place to send the energy our boys have during dinner hour. having a place for the kids to play in our basement during rainy days and winter months keeps us all sane! a good use of space ‚Äì for some reason, it seems to be difficult to find homes that utilize the square footage well! we are basically just looking for good bones and potential to use a home that functionally work well for our family. closet and storage space and bigger main living areas aren‚Äôt always easy to come across. a decent flat yard ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt have to be huge, but we spend sooo much time in our backyard that we realize a patio and a flat yard is our best use of space in the summer. so many sweet backyard memories in this house! will this be our forever home? most likely not! for us a forever home would be one that checks all of the above, as well as the home our kids can grow up in and come home to when they are older. would i love to find that? yes. however, with the cost of housing in nashville right now, we most likely will not find something that checks all of the boxes. as mentioned above though, nothing in life is guaranteed, and the hunt for a forever home can be an unnecessary pressure we put on ourselves to chase ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù i know that no matter if we stay in this next home forever or not, it will be a special place to our family. when it comes down to it, home is where you are free to be yourself, where you can rest and find comfort, and where you can spend time with the people you love the most. that can be achieved anywhere. so, i am ok knowing that if we invest time and energy into a space that builds a home for our family, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúforever home.‚Äù writing this post has gotten me thinking‚Ä¶what would you consider a forever home? or home for that matter? i love hearing different perspectives on this topic. wish us luck on the hunt! you may also like a festive holiday bar cart 10 planters + 10 indoor greens to pair with them. walk-in pantry design leave a comment (cancel) theresa backowski march 5, 2020 we thought our last home was our forever one. we were there for 11 years, birthed 3 babies there, started broke and worked our way to stability there,‚Ä¶..life happened there. we were on the verge of finally being able to put the work/renovations into it. then life changed and brought us back to our roots. the move was a complete act of faith for us‚Ä¶..knowing it was what we needed to do but not knowing what it would look like long term. i can say with certainty that we are living these past 18 months in our forever home. a home i couldn‚Äôt have dreamed up if i tried. a home that dropped into our path and fit all of our awkward requirements (we never thought all the requirements would be met but they were). while we miss our old home very very much (still), ‚Äúhome‚Äù is definitely where the heart is. it‚Äôs where all my loves gather and make memories. ‚Äúhome‚Äù can be made anywhere a person is willing to put heart into. and you, anna, are amazing at doing that. best of luck, my friend. i hope you find exactly what you are looking for and everything you need there. you are covered in grace and love. praying for you. reply anna liesemeyer march 5, 2020 theresa! that gives me all the goosebumps. i love that so much. i also like to believe that god loves to outdo our dreams if we give him space to:) reply samantha march 5, 2020 hendersonville is a great area with fantastic schools, and an awesome catholic community! the houses are way more reasonable than other areas of nashville üôÇ reply sarah march 5, 2020 curious if y‚Äôall are looking in the franklin area?! reply moira march 5, 2020 where did you find those gorgeous antique gold curtain pull backs? i love them! reply anna liesemeyer march 5, 2020 hi moira! i got them as a two pack from pottery barn! http://bit.ly/32rmcug reply ginamarie march 5, 2020 we just bought our first house last may and it was very unexpected. it‚Äôs also a townhouse (but spacious and lots of natural light!) where i grew up, you bought a single family house with a yard at least big enough for a football game and raise all the babies, and die there.) so the thought of buying a townhouse was completely different from my expectations. once we realized it wasn‚Äôt our ‚Äúforever home‚Äù, it was a lot easier to move forward (because it was the right decision for us. i still want this forever home, but if i waited for it, i wonder how long we would remain in limbo for. as a family we needed/need to plant roots, even if it‚Äôs not forever. we‚Äôre so happy here and it‚Äôs met so many of my expectations and those i didn‚Äôt even know i had. i‚Äôm also happy to relax and remain here until reality shows us a different path to follow. god is good and he works through reality, just gotta respond to it! reply anna liesemeyer march 5, 2020 isn‚Äôt that true?! i grew up in the midwest, and no one ever leaves their hometowns. it really does take the pressure off to be able to look for a home based on your current phase of life. reply julie march 6, 2020 i like your perspective! it is very hard to say for sure if the next home will be a forever home! my husband and i are also looking for our next home. similar to what you said, the area we are looking to move to will bring a significant increase to our mortgage and it seems near impossible that we‚Äôll get everything we want. i‚Äôm just hoping for something cute enough with potential. best of luck to you and your family, i hope the search is relatively easy and quick! reply yasmara march 6, 2020 i‚Äôm guessing you posted this before the tornadoes in nashville. has that changed your housing search at all? reply anna liesemeyer march 11, 2020 thankfully no! we haven‚Äôt bought a home yet so will still be searching. so heartbroken for all of those affected by them! reply anna liesemeyer march 6, 2020 thank you julie! wishing you the same! reply ‚Üê older post newer post ‚Üí instagram facebook pinterest youtube bloglovin the ihod shop: clean skin care + makeup favorites happening on instagram: follow + archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 find us on pinterest: copyright ¬© 2020 in honor of design. theme by maiden sites, site hosting by flywheel powered by chlo√©digital
