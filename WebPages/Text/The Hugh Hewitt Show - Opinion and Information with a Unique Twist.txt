(read this link – please!) what’s my point? my point is that this is not a science discussion, it is a political and a leadership discussion. the science discussion cannot be settled scientifically because we cannot ever know with certainty the accuracy of our science going in. if our leadership thought the decision to shut everything down was hard – the decision about when and how to open things up is going to be even harder. those decisions are clearly approaching, with great rapidity. we went into this thing with the idea of a couple of weeks, but as it has progressed the discussion is now about months. most people are simply unwilling to live like this for a matter of months. many people will suffer irreparable harm if forced to live this way for months – harm not dissimilar from what they might suffer with covid-19. the scientists have become the media focal point in this whole thing, but in the end it is not, nor can it be, their decision to make. they were not elected to lead the nation, the state, the county, the city…. it is in the nature of our elected officials to push people like the scientists out front. that’s called deflection, it is a way of avoiding responsibility so they can get re-elected. no such luck this time. in the end this is political, not scientific. ladies and gentlemen, we do not stand on a precipice where one way lies death and the other safety. we stand on a ridge where forward and backwards present a rugged and difficult path, and one misstep can send us plummeting off either side. there is no easy or clear decision here, but there is an absolute necessity to make one. this is what you were elected for. i pray earnestly that you rise to the challenge. fri, mar 27, 2020 | by hugh hewitt acting secretary of the navy thomas modly on the virus and the fleet, with an update on the tr (and the frigate competition) tweet email print acting secretary of the navy thomas modly joined me this am: audio: 03-27hhs-modly transcript: hh: joined now by acting secretary of the navy thomas modly. secretary modly, welcome back. a month ago, we were talking about the coronavirus and the navy. you were prepared then. now, the teddy roosevelt is in guam with many cases. can you give us a status update? tm: good morning, hugh. thanks for having me on. and the, as you mentioned, the teddy roosevelt has pulled into guam and is tied up pierside there. we’re restricting motion of the sailors off the ship only to the pier area, so they won’t be allowed to sort of wander around in guam. we are testing every single sailor on that ship, and we’re going through that process right now. and all the sailors that we have so far that have tested positive have been either sort of asymptomatic positive tests or sailors who were exhibiting very mild symptoms. so that’s what we, we don’t have anyone that’s seriously ill. in fact, the folks that we took off the ship a few days ago, none of them were even hospitalized. they’re just sort of in isolation right now in quarantine. so we’re just monitoring it very closely and working our way through making sure we have all the sailors tested. read more fri, mar 27, 2020 | by benjamin bryggman hugh hewitt’s “the rundown” tweet email print thu, mar 26, 2020 | by john schroeder america the optimistic tweet email print i went to bed last night depressed about the state of our media. it seems like there is no good news which it will allow to stand. as soon as there is a breath of fresh air – anywhere, they seem to rush out to find contrarians, disagreement and nay-sayers. i had spent the day yesterday collecting bits of good news, but my last reading of the night literally had something somewhere attempting to undo every bit i had collected. it was utterly depressing. i awoke this morning to a tweet from the host last night that i had missed: people are dying, businesses closing and media is considering not carrying task force briefings on the crisis because of hatred for @realdonaldtrump and belief they know what is true? astonishing and the end of journalism if carried through. i can’t believe it. https://t.co/japz21devi — hugh hewitt (@hughhewitt) march 26, 2020 it confirmed what i had gone to bed thinking – the media generally does not want to see us come out of this. i thought about this – churchill rallying parliament after dunkirk with one of the greatest pieces of oratory in the english language. i thought about this – martin luther king rallying america, the nation, to goodness in light of the wrong that was segregation. (also one of the greatest orations ever in english) we are a nation that when called responds with our best. we believe we are good, we believe we will win. and when we are allowed to we are good and we do win. but we are currently shackled by a media that seemingly wants us cowering, fearful and ill-informed – never letting any good news that might rally us, might give us hope to go unchallenged. imagine if you will a press that after those stunning pieces of hope-creating oratory i linked above jumped upon them and “analyzed” them, word-by-word, checking punctuation, timing delivery, generally searching for any flaw or misstep and using that one, tiny error as a reason to reject the whole. that’s the nation we live in right now. it is hope-stealing and soul-crushing. and i have had just about all i can handle of it. do you know how bad it has gotten? praise the lord! my business, while slower than it has been, is doing quite well. i have booked more than one new client in the last two weeks – that is miraculous in these circumstances. each evening on our exercise walk my wife and i stop by one of our local haunts, now rendered a take-out window, and buy a gift certificate doing our best to spread the miracle. last night i went to bed fighting guilt for my blessing – and fear that it was an artifice of some sort. what kind of nation have we become when anyone feels guilty and afraid for receiving a blessing and passing that blessing on? the media serves the nation. and right now, right this minute, the nation needs hope and cheer. so here is what i suggest – turn off tv news. just turn it off and don’t turn it back on. we’re all experiencing a level of boredom – watch something classic, something wonderful. my link above is to the 2017 movie “darkest hour.” watch that. watch londoners on “the tube” give churchill hope and watch him transmit that hope to his nation. watch “in the shadow of the moon” – a documentary about the apollo program – and remember an america that could do anything it set its mind to. if not those, pick your personal favorite story of hope. there are two ways to look at any problem. some years ago i was on a cruise and watched the captain attempt to dock our vessel in very difficult circumstances. the dock was perpendicular to the mouth of a canyon that had very strong winds rushing down it and trying to push the ship back to sea. there were no tugs, the vessels was using its maneuvering thrusters to dock, the captain was deftly trying to use enough thrust to overcome the wind, but not crush the dock. at one point a line snapped. thankfully no one was hurt. the captain used that incident to harden his resolve and the ship was soon safely tied up. later that day i complimented the captain. he was embarrassed about breaking the line and viewed it as a failure. i told him simply that a lesser man would have given up after that and i admired his ability to adapt and overcome. we are a nation of optimists. like that captain, we stare a problem in the face and we deal with it. then we move on to tackle the next problem. we do so because we believe in ourselves and we believe in our god. our media seem to think less of us – or maybe they are just looking in a mirror. either way we need to get about the business of dealing with it – not hiding in our homes having the media try to scare us under our couches. thu, mar 26, 2020 | by hugh hewitt secretary of state mike pompeo on america, china, iran and rest of the world in this era of the wuhan virus tweet email print secretary of state michael pompeo joined me this morning: audio: 03-26hhs-pompeo transcript: hh: joined by united states secretary of state michael pompeo. good morning, mr. secretary, how are you and your family? mp: we’re all good, hugh. i hope your family is good, too. it’s great to be with you this morning. hh: thank you. my mandatory two disclosures: my son works at state. that’s about the hundredth time i’ve said that. but the new disclosure is that after you and mrs. pompeo bought a jigsaw puzzle and put it on instagram, the fetching mrs. hewitt bought one. so i have a grudge against you now. mp: yes, i understand that’s not your favorite pastime, so i apologize for that. hh: all right. first, bravo to the men and women of state around the world holding the line in some countries where the virus is on a rampage, not blinking. it’s like your old cia colleagues and your old comrades in arms in the military. just thank you and to everyone at state. mp: hugh, thank you. the team has responded in a way that’s in the finest tradition of american diplomacy. our team is out there taking care of americans, keeping our own teams safe. and we’ve now brought over 10,000 americans back home from places where they were stranded through no fault of their own. there’s still a lot of work to do. we’ve got a lot of people who are trying to get back this way, and with travel shut down in many of these countries without any notice or little notice, there’s still a major undertaking. but the team has marshaled the resources. it’s an airlift back home like we’ve not seen in an awfully long time, and
