(john watterson is a jake thackray tribute act, although the term ‘tribute act’ doesn’t quite do him justice, associated as it is with the another-day-another-dollar touring mainstream. after all, being a jake thackray tribute act is a niche occupation rather than a sure-fire route to a quick buck. i’ve not seen him live, but he’s splendid on video. john performs as ‘fake thackray’, which is reason enough to book him for pretty well any musical function you could ever think of.) would i be interested? yes. i would. audio files began to appear in my inbox over the next couple of months. they came with explanations and annotations: this song was from x; this one was written about y. occasionally a touch of anxiety filtered through in the emails: do you think this bit works? is the background to this song explained adequately? these were people who cared deeply about getting it right; of doing justice to the legacy. i made a couple of the most minor and tentative suggestions about a liner note, and poked my head above the parapet in a debate about instrumentation. but mainly i just listened and gaped. john watterson doesn’t simply ‘do’ jake thackray in the way that most people with a certain type of voice might be able to ‘do’ a pretty good bob dylan (guilty), or a johnny cash (not one of my best), or an elvis (no good whatsoever) or, indeed, a barry gibb (doubly guilty, and have wowed karaoke audiences accordingly). john just seems to inhabit jake’s voice: the inflexions, the mannerisms, the little asides. some of these songs have been heard in live recordings before, but many haven’t: it’s not as if john could have simply copied the originals. his performance is the aural equivalent of seeing a ghost; it makes your brain go funny. some weeks later, my father and i sat down with a bottle of red and i played him the finished but unmastered tracks in a rough album order; i will cherish the look of confusion on his face before i recapped to explain all. of course the obvious question about any artist’s ‘lost’ material is: ‘why was it lost?’ and, more pertinently: ‘is it any good?’ to which the answer is: ‘yes.’ i can say that confidently, now that the initial impact of hearing it has passed. these aren’t songs that weren’t good enough to commit to vinyl at the time, but a mixture of work that post-dated jake thackray’s recording career, that was recorded for tv but not for album release or that were a staple of his live performances. a couple of tracks survived as lyrics alone; these have been set to new music. so all-in-all a bit of a treasure trove. there you go: an unexpected coda to the tale. this is the lot; paul and john have been through jake’s old papers and archives, and there’s nothing else. the lost will and testament of jake thackray has now been released, with the backing of jake’s family and ralph mctell. one of the best, most brilliant things about my life is that sometimes the things that i’ve done, be it work-wise, authoring or blogging, have afforded me a little glimpse through unexpected doors – and this has been one of the nicest, most unexpected doors of all. here’s the youtube commercial. see what you think. the cd’s available via the amazon link above; cut out the middleman by buying it via john’s own website. click to share on twitter (opens in new window) click to share on facebook (opens in new window) click to share on reddit (opens in new window) related post navigation “so she slammed the tailgate, but unfortunately that thrust the canoe forwards through the windscreen…” on leonard cohen, and music before words 4 thoughts on “the lost will and testament of jake thackray” rachel green says: october 8, 2016 at 9:28 am awesome. jake thackery defined my twenties, where i was a beer-swilling morris dancer. john watterson says: october 8, 2016 at 4:44 pm alex – you are far too generous in your praise – but thank you so much anyway!
