i would love to hear what women think about long hair with suits and contrast that with what the men think about the same issue. i wore long hair with suits until about thirty but after that does it get a bit tricky? i don't think i will grow my hair long again until it is mostly to all white. posted by the sartorialist at 6:59 pm 161 comments on the street........that fan, florence i see this gentleman often at pitti and he is always beautifully dressed. i love the sleeve length, pant length and overall fit of the jacket. the slimness of the jacket and pants actually creates a lengthening effect. i would maybe try a slightly more narrow tie and smaller collar on the shirt but that is personal choice. notice the upper sleeve, over biceps, section of his jacket - i always try to get that sleeve section a slight bit more narrow. it really finishes off the overall long, slimming effect of a slim cut suit. look at astaire, his sleeves in that section are always very narrow. it is a very small detail but one that always stands out to me when i watch astaire movies. to the opposite effect, if you are narrow this is a good spot to create a wider visual. posted by the sartorialist at 9:13 am 31 comments on the street.........sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 6:41 am 40 comments on the street........olof., stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 6:38 am 48 comments thursday, august 30, 2007 on the street.........paris, france posted by the sartorialist at 7:27 pm 91 comments on the street.........vintage dress, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 8:39 am 60 comments on the street.........those shoes, florence posted by the sartorialist at 7:47 am 45 comments wednesday, august 29, 2007 on the street.........martin, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 8:31 am 56 comments on the street.........matte, flat & shiny, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 8:22 am 42 comments tuesday, august 28, 2007 after one year in new york - kelly spring 2006 summer 2007 posted by the sartorialist at 9:21 am 146 comments after one year in new york - kara kara, feb 2007 kara, aug 2007 so i'm walking down the street in soho the other day and see a young lady that would be great for a photo. i introduce myself but she is already talking to me like she knows me. while she is talking (how was sweden....blah, blah) i'm completely distracted trying to figure out how i know her. finally she mentions that i had taken a photo of her last february at the proenza schouler/target sale at opening ceremony. so i take the picture and that night i look up the older photo she described and i was stunned. i could not believe is was the same girl - i never would have recognized her. all the big smile and midwestern charm (she is from oakbrook, chicago) from the first picture are still there but now they are wrapped in a more sophisticated, urbane exterior. she had mentioned she emailed me once about an internship so i found the email and replied asking how she had created such a dramatic change. she mentioned the usual stuff like better stores (less mall shopping) and being inspired by the streets of new york (and my blog) and that new york just helped her be who she really felt like she was. actually the line that i think was the most telling but that she said like a throw-away qualifier was "i didn't know anyone in new york when i moved here...." i think that is such a huge factor. to move to a city where you are not afraid to try something new because all the people that labeled who they think you are (parents, childhood friends) are not their to say " that's not you" or "you've changed". well, maybe that person didn't change but finally became who they really are. i totally relate to this as a fellow midwesterner even though my changes were not as quick or as dramatic. i bet if you ask most people what keeps them from being who they really want to be (at least stylistically or maybe even more), the answer would not be money but the fear of peer pressure - fear of embarrassing themselves in front of a group of people that they might not actually even like anyway. if you were really honest with yourself and really wanted to change your style what is keeping you from doing that? is it really the cost? is it really your psychical shape? availability of goods? or is it not fitting in at your office, or pta, or skateboard park? anyway, i have another example of this "new york effect" that will blow you away. you have seen her recently on the blog and the difference between the first shot and the recent shot is shocking. i will post those shots around 6pm posted by the sartorialist at 9:18 am 205 comments save for next summer.....brown & white while in florence last time, i saw several guys looking great with the brown/white color combo. i'm torn though as to whether i should try this look next summer or wait till my hair turns their shade of silvery white (which ,come to think of it, might also be next summer!) posted by the sartorialist at 6:51 am 17 comments monday, august 27, 2007 on the street.........mid-afternoon sparkle, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 6:23 pm 39 comments on the street.........bold check, paris posted by the sartorialist at 4:41 pm 13 comments september gq from paris posted by the sartorialist at 9:03 am 57 comments metalworks plant, milan when i was in milan for the salone last april i stumbled across this metalworks plant. it seemed like everywhere i turned was another fantastic creation. they must make these for store displays and the stage. i really loved the little newspaper hat that the sweeper had made for himself - creative is as creative does. posted by the sartorialist at 8:54 am 26 comments sunday, august 26, 2007 european shorts, milan & paris posted by the sartorialist at 9:14 am 83 comments friday, august 24, 2007 guess who i ran into....nacho i was doing some pre-fashion week shopping at polo (with my camera in tow) and as i was leaving i ran into nacho. i almost didn't recognize him without the cap ( i guess i didn't realize he had so much hair) today style.com posted more photos from my weekend trip to the polo match in bridgehampton. posted by the sartorialist at 8:22 am 93 comments at the polo grounds....bridgehampton posted by the sartorialist at 7:25 am 57 comments thursday, august 23, 2007 on the street.........mad plaider, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 8:53 am 57 comments on the street.........one more time, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 8:35 am 38 comments wednesday, august 22, 2007 on the street..........good hair, good style bastard, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 10:22 pm 93 comments on the street.........urbane & graffittied, sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 9:24 pm 63 comments on the street..swedish navy, ostermalm stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 9:20 am 58 comments on the street..........ostermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 8:25 am 46 comments tuesday, august 21, 2007 on the street..industrial zip, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 5:56 pm 65 comments on the street..another successfully shrunken jacket, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 5:02 pm 30 comments on the street......sequin cardigan homme, sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 9:00 am 61 comments on the street.....black, white & green, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 8:02 am 40 comments monday, august 20, 2007 on the steps......print dress & strappy shoes, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 3:29 pm 39 comments on the street......tied tee, sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 3:04 pm 40 comments on the street......so well done, ostermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 8:30 am 44 comments on the street......sweet-ish, sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 8:27 am 37 comments on the street......fur collar, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 7:43 am 36 comments sunday, august 19, 2007 on the street......hi-waisted jeans, sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 9:38 am 69 comments on the street......not half plaid, sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 9:00 am 45 comments friday, august 17, 2007 on the street....graceful, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 3:21 am 140 comments newer posts older posts
