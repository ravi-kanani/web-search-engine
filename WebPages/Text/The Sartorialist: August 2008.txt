(to really get the shot, click on the photo to enlarge the image) in the bottom photo, the snap on claudia's top suddenly broke and she has this surprised/embarrassed laugh that shows just how cool she is and able to laugh-off her own embarrassment. those are moments you can't script or re-shoot but when you see the elements coming together (like the two of them playing nicely with each other) then you just have to place yourself in the position to get the right light and angle. the photo "that moment" posted july 14th was taken with the same idea - i saw the perfect light and the activity of people running into the show so i stayed in one spot and just kinda waited for something to happen. most of the time nothing happens, but the few times it does the reward can be really great. posted by the sartorialist at 9:48 am 82 comments so i found my hat for vacation on july 22nd i did a post about wanting to find a good panama hat. thanks for all the great suggestions of where to find them. i looked at a lot of high-end options and mass-produced options but the one problem that i couldn't get out of my head was the image of my new hat blowing down the beach never to be seen again. in the end i found the perfect hat at (of all unexpected places) marc jacobs on mercer st. it only cost around $40 so if i lost it i was only going to cry a little. what really sold me on the hat was the "fiber" it was made of and how "crinkly/wrinkly" it could get. for $40 i can only imagine the hat is made from recycled styrofoam coffee cups, but i'm ok with that. to be honest, after wearing it for a while i am still debating if it is really me. i love the romantic euro-allure of it but when i'm playing on the beach (and i mean playing hard - like paddle ball with a nine year old) it is hard for me to feel right in anything other than a yankees cap and wrap-stemmed rayban aviator sunglasses. for me, style is about not being afraid to try something new but being honest enough with yourself that even though "it" might be "fashionable", "it" might not be you. posted by the sartorialist at 9:13 am 71 comments thursday, august 14, 2008 on the street.....the stockholm look via los angeles posted by the sartorialist at 8:10 am 82 comments on the street.....poolside at the roosevelt, la more shots from la in the new september gq posted by the sartorialist at 8:02 am 114 comments tuesday, august 12, 2008 vacation days for the next few days i will be on vacation but i will post a few new shots on thursday and friday and then on to stockholm next week! posted by the sartorialist at 9:18 am 49 comments monday, august 11, 2008 on the street.....lucia early evening, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 8:50 am 113 comments next week... back to stockholm! posted by the sartorialist at 8:49 am 24 comments on the street.....two, paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:48 am 106 comments friday, august 08, 2008 on the street... casual friday men's ex style posted by the sartorialist at 1:39 pm 59 comments on the street...crosby st., manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 9:10 am 96 comments let's consider...silk shorts i don't own a pair of silk shorts but the idea intrigues me. i love the color and print potential that only silk can bring to a look, plus the natural sheen of silk would be an additional visual element that you just can't get from cotton. hopefully will will see a few more options in the stores next season. posted by the sartorialist at 8:59 am 103 comments thursday, august 07, 2008 on the street...andre benjamin, florence so it was the last day of pitti, really hot in florence and after being outside all day shooting the heat was starting to get to me. all i wanted to do was stop into a few shops on my way back to the hotel and then spend the rest of the night working on images in my air conditioned room. at around 6:45 i popped into boggi. the place was about to close and there was only one other guy in the shop. now, i had just watched the movie semi-pro on the plane on the way over and the guy in the shop looked surprisingly similar to coffee black. i didn't think it was him because it was just so out of context. i got up the courage to ask if he was the guy in the movie, and just about the time he said yes i remembered his name (thank god!). of course i knew all about him, but again because it was so out of context i was blanking. anyway, i told him i did a blog called the sartorialist and now he was all excited because he said that he loved the blog and looks at it often. now i'm totally blushing - i know a lot of people look at my blog but i never think it is someone like him (or kanye!) (and by "him" i mean any big star) so , of course i ask if we can go pop outside and take a fast shot. we find a great background and the photo above is that moment. honestly, i had to take a few shots because i was still so psyched that this was happening. we went back to the store and he ended up buying the blue knit shirt that i recommended (i'm wearing mine in the style.com video a few post down). anyway, that is the back story of this photo. ps. i will make a prediction now that semi-pro will clean up at this years oscars!! if you haven't seen it yet run to buy the dvd - will ferrell rocks!! posted by the sartorialist at 5:30 pm 160 comments on the street...masha, soho posted by the sartorialist at 8:32 am 62 comments on the street...park ave., manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 8:25 am 88 comments wednesday, august 06, 2008 on the street... mama mia, milan posted by the sartorialist at 10:11 am 161 comments on the street... structured jacket and shorts, paris the other day i posted several guys wearing unconstructed jackets and shorts - i think they all looked great. a variation on that theme is the idea of a very structured jacket and shorts. personally, next summer i think i will try a more structured jacket like the one above when i am wearing my shorts in milan (gasp! shorts in milan!). this summer i wore a lot of unconstructed jackets but i find that for my shape an unconstructed jacket is too shapeless and makes me look square. well, i guess you live and learn. posted by the sartorialist at 10:01 am 54 comments tuesday, august 05, 2008 on the street.....macho man fabrizio, milan posted by the sartorialist at 5:23 pm 98 comments on the street...casual formality, milan i like the idea of the sporty cotton jacket and white jeans with a french-cuffed shirt. even when the milanese try to be sporty it always comes up with just a touch of formality. posted by the sartorialist at 8:30 am 63 comments on the street...graceful steps paris i love the design details i love the harmony of colors but i most love the graceful way she walks. posted by the sartorialist at 8:25 am 40 comments monday, august 04, 2008 here is the gap ad! so, remember when i was shot for this back in april? well, here is the result. even though this blog is very personal it feels like it has grown bigger than me. i used to occasionally post photos of myself, but now i feel much more self-conscious about doing that. however, this is a story that i shared a while ago and this feels like a fitting end on that episode. posted by the sartorialist at 5:30 pm 322 comments on the street...luca rubinacci, milan luca is another guy that deserves to be on this blog as often as possible. as a blogger/photographer i love finding new people to shoot but as a sartorialist i always want to seeing what luca is wearing when i am in milan. i love that you really get a sense of luca's young spirit - a lavender jacket in sober/formal milan is a real statement. can't you just imagine him riding around milan or london on his vespa in this look. i will update the details tonight but i know luca comes to manhattan to see clients about once a month. if you want a bespoke suit with a little attitude then luca should be one of the guys you consider. posted by the sartorialist at 7:46 am 69 comments on the street...young and in paris posted by the sartorialist at 7:43 am 82 comments out of the storm, milan posted by the sartorialist at 7:34 am 31 comments sunday, august 03, 2008 sunday's best posted by the sartorialist at 8:20 am 42 comments newer posts older posts
