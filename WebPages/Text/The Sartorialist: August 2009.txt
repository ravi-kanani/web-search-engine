this month glamour magazine ran this photograph which has created quite a stir here in the us. it seems women desperately want more images that highlight the variety of beauty that the female form has to offer. if that is true, then this should become one of the biggest selling issues in conde nast history. actually it just might become the biggest seller. when we wanted to do a post about this tracy went to three different shops to find the magazine but all three were sold out. we had to scan this from the ny post. when i am shooting on the street older women and larger size women often say "no" to my request to shoot them. actually, much more than any other category of people i shoot. i think they have a real suspicion about how the image will be used. i also think there continues to be a growing disconnect between the fashion community and "average" women in general however, do you think that this economic crisis has forced the fashion community to open it's eyes a little bit to what the customers want?

doesn't it feel like a bit of overcompensation? or does it read like a symbol of success - like a shiny sporty car for your arm (and not much smaller)? posted by the sartorialist at 8:54 am 437 comments wednesday, august 26, 2009 on the street....new york bike, nyc maybe it is all of the new bike lanes (thanks mayor bloomberg), but new yorkers have fallen in love with their bikes again. what i am proud of is that like any real style capital new yorkers are doing it their way - sporty, sexy, and built for speed. just look at the difference between these new york ladies i shot yesterday and the young ladies garance shot recently in amsterdam. i'm not saying one is better than the other, but it is great that something like this can be so reflective of a cultures taste and aesthetics. posted by the sartorialist at 8:37 am 195 comments on the street.... starting the transition mid weight cottons, rich colors, light layers...it is still the dog days of summer, but transition is right around the corner. posted by the sartorialist at 8:35 am 50 comments tuesday, august 25, 2009 on the street.... so simple, florence posted by the sartorialist at 9:31 am 183 comments monday, august 24, 2009 on the street.... well suited, florence posted by the sartorialist at 9:56 am 130 comments on the street.... at pitti uomo, florence posted by the sartorialist at 9:30 am 39 comments friday, august 21, 2009 on the street....garance doré in full summer beauty, paris posted by the sartorialist at 10:58 am 212 comments on the street....grey suit, milan how do they do it? without fail, no matter the miserable weather outside, september fashion magazines make me start dreaming of flannels and cashmere. i guess i am partly to blame. i took this photo of a cucinelli suit in milan recently, for the september issue of gq, and have been thinking about it ever since. shame on me. posted by the sartorialist at 10:42 am 120 comments thursday, august 20, 2009 on the street....seventh ave., nyc posted by the sartorialist at 8:40 am 71 comments on the street....soho bike, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 8:39 am 100 comments wednesday, august 19, 2009 on the street....greene st., new york city it has been so hot in nyc that it is actually refreshing to see a young lady in anything besides denim cutoff shorts. posted by the sartorialist at 8:31 am 286 comments on the street....childish color, new york posted by the sartorialist at 5:33 am 101 comments tuesday, august 18, 2009 on the street....fabrizio against the heat, paris posted by the sartorialist at 10:36 am 147 comments monday, august 17, 2009 on the street...fifth ave., nyc posted by the sartorialist at 2:36 pm 117 comments on the street...ninth ave., nyc with all white the slightest touch of color can be just enough. posted by the sartorialist at 2:34 pm 95 comments thursday, august 13, 2009 on the street...greene st., nyc posted by the sartorialist at 10:47 am 244 comments on the street....slim sleeve, florence i love the simple color story of navy, tan and brown; but what really caught my eye was the slimness of their jacket sleeves. look how narrow they are around the wrist - so many of today's jackets are cut so loose to fit everyone (or at least everyone with fat wrists). posted by the sartorialist at 10:39 am 105 comments wednesday, august 12, 2009 on the street....crisp on a hot summer day, florence posted by the sartorialist at 5:30 pm 115 comments a simple portrait more than the comme des garcons black/green camo jacket, i love the gentle spirit of this young man. for me, the whole shot is about the way he holds his hands and his posture. this is where personal interpretation comes into play - is this heartbreaking? tender? calm? sad? reflective? posted by the sartorialist at 6:50 am 119 comments tuesday, august 11, 2009 the sartorialist via the selby @ lanvin homme my very plugged in assistant tracy found this photograph of lucas ossendrijver's (lanvin menswear) design studio on the selby. instantly she recognized two of my images on his inspiration board. i often hear that designers use my images for inspiration, but i never believe it until i see it, so this is pretty cool. i'm often asked in interviews if my photos have a direct effect on trends. i always say that designers don't really look at my site for direct copying, but instead for a spirit - and the photos that lucas has chosen are a perfect example of this idea. posted by the sartorialist at 5:32 pm 87 comments on the street.... mr. rubinacci, florence posted by the sartorialist at 7:07 am 115 comments on the street.... anna dello russo, milan posted by the sartorialist at 6:09 am 133 comments monday, august 10, 2009 on the street.... summer plaid, florence so i guess the only question about this look is the belt/shoe coordination thing. i didn't even really notice they were unmatched until later, so for me it works because it's not distracting. however, i know a lot of people are very obsessed with things like this. posted by the sartorialist at 5:37 pm 133 comments on the street....the man, milan it's his world and we are just his subjects. posted by the sartorialist at 10:47 am 106 comments on the street.... eva in black & white, milan i know i shoot eva a lot, but come on, when she looks like this all the time how can i not shoot her. posted by the sartorialist at 10:00 am 83 comments sunday, august 09, 2009 style piccoli so finally i get to share the shoot i did for style piccoli with my kids and their friends. claudia (above) is such a ham and a natural model. i would just tell her the concept of the character and she somehow just got it. i used to shoot kids a lot more, but i'm such a big kid that i could never get them to sit still or stop jumping on me long enough to get the shot. posted by the sartorialist at 8:54 am 163 comments saturday, august 08, 2009 on the street.... model style, paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:44 am 150 comments friday, august 07, 2009 on the street.... so simple, so perfect, paris posted by the sartorialist at 4:00 pm 117 comments on the street.... vintage shirt, florence what a great way to make a 50 year old vintage shirt look so new and modern. so often vintage just screams vintage! i think it is a real skill to integrate vintage into a look and keep the viewer guessing if it is a modern piece or very old. i think that is a subtle, but huge part of the success of prada. posted by the sartorialist at 8:36 am 53 comments thursday, august 06, 2009 on the street.... the next step, florence posted by the sartorialist at 5:35 pm 178 comments on the street.... high-top cons and jackets, florence posted by the sartorialist at 8:58 am 104 comments when we first met.... lucy above is lucy, i took this picture when i first met her at a cafe in melbourne. i thought she looked so cool sitting there during her coffee break - so french somehow. i knew the picture wasn't right for the blog, but when the saba job came up she was one of the first people i suggested we shoot. i'm really proud that with each of the people we shot we were able to maintain the true nature of the subject. posted by the sartorialist at 7:45 am 96 comments newer posts older posts
