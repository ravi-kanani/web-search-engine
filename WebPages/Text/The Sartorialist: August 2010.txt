that's tricky. too often it comes off as master champ. i think the real key is to wear polo as sleek as the suit. the next critical question would then be, collar in or out? posted by the sartorialist at 9:00 am 236 comments wednesday, august 11, 2010 on the street....viale piave, milano posted by the sartorialist at 10:14 am 211 comments tuesday, august 10, 2010 my favorite off-runway look, paris posted by the sartorialist at 4:29 pm 127 comments on the street....happy clothes, florence posted by the sartorialist at 8:45 am 172 comments monday, august 09, 2010 on the street....rugged & refined, florence rugged and refined, think steve mcqueen or gene kelly. posted by the sartorialist at 8:59 am 94 comments sunday, august 08, 2010 on the street....sartorial denim, florence posted by the sartorialist at 8:35 am 201 comments friday, august 06, 2010 on the street....country style, milan while i was working on this image garance mentioned that it was the perfect way to end the week that started with the young mennonite girl from last monday's post. posted by the sartorialist at 8:37 am 200 comments thursday, august 05, 2010 the italian fit? try a back dart what makes italians looks so slim? what helps them look so refined when casually dressed? the back dart on their shirts is a big factor. ps. also note how meticulously the sleeves are rolled-up in both examples posted by the sartorialist at 4:32 pm 218 comments on the street....the summer of the blue shoe, new york posted by the sartorialist at 9:46 am 160 comments wednesday, august 04, 2010 on the street....milan in color, milan posted by the sartorialist at 8:43 am 189 comments tuesday, august 03, 2010 on the street....the combination, milano i love the fit and proportion of the suit but ,for me, this shot is really about the super sophisticated tie-to-suit combination. posted by the sartorialist at 4:30 pm 95 comments on the street... thirteenth st., new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:14 am 137 comments monday, august 02, 2010 on the road....route 45, woodward, pennsylvania (click on image to enlarge) posted by the sartorialist at 3:50 pm 202 comments on the road....route 45, woodward, pennsylvania posted by the sartorialist at 8:53 am 216 comments sunday, august 01, 2010 on the street....the rubinacci, milano posted by the sartorialist at 11:07 am 136 comments newer posts older posts
