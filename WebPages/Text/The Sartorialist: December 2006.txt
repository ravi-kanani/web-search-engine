posted by the sartorialist at 4:54 pm 32 comments january gq - deniro cover my new gq page just hit the stands. in this issue i highlight the "no-tie" (or as adam from gq says "air-tie" look) that i have been seeing again on some cool guys on the street and on the runways of paris and milan. also my good friend mory makes an appearance on the page! his part is pretty funny (and racy), you gotta read it - even if it is just while you are standing in the magazine section of barnes & noble. posted by the sartorialist at 9:05 am 24 comments on the street.....martin grant peacoat, soho i love it when an item looks so simple from the front but when it walks past, you're just able to catch a glimpse of the "drama in the back". a buyer once told me "drama in the back" was a favorite phrase of one of her salespeople. i always thought it sounded great and , well, dramatic but i have never found a situation to use it myself. today..(dramatic pause)...is my day. posted by the sartorialist at 8:33 am 59 comments wednesday, december 20, 2006 the contest winner so many great entries! it was fascinating to read about such a diverse world of inspirations. i was a little surprised (pleasantly) that so much inspiration came from the home or personal interaction. i think these entries also said a lot about respect. our respect for others, for family and for those that care for themselves. a lot of grandparents were mentioned and again i think that has a lot to do with love/respect and how love/respect influences our concept of what is beautiful. for the winner i chose the entery below. what really got me was this line " my grandfather’s work bench and tools, where he set the diamonds into the ring i wear every day now and taught me to love the hard, precise labour of making things sparkle..." that line really speaks to me and captures what i love about the craft of fashion, couture and tailoring. for me fashion and style is not about "i'm better than you" or "look what i have " but about the craft of making something beautiful or graceful. i'm a complete sucker for that romantic vision of a artisan in some little dim lit room crafting a pair of shoes or a shirt or ,for that matter, in a darkroom working on the perfect print. that line could also just as easily reflect what we do to present ourselves in the way we feel most expresses who we are. "to love the hard, precise labour of making things sparkle..." perfect! even though i’m by long habit an observer rather than a joiner, i couldn't resist this question - any more than i can this blog! here's a selection of some of the many images that have floated up since i’ve been musing on “what has most inspired your personal style?” my grandmother’s cloche hat and fur-collared coat, which she wears in a photo from the roaring 20s when, appearances to the contrary, she was just a teenage kid from montreal’s saint urbain street... myrna loy in the thin man movies, with her gowns for every hour and her wit for any situation ... my grandfather’s work bench and tools, where he set the diamonds into the ring i wear every day now and taught me to love the hard, precise labour of making things sparkle... my grandmother’s dresser drawers, where sweaters were swathed in tissue and nylons nestled in satin boxes... my great aunt’s silk scarves, which she doled out to me one at a time on holidays and which i have somehow, between then and now, lost... audrey hepburn in roman holiday, when she cut her long hair and rolled up the sleeves of her proper dress, and became herself... my mother’s leather mini skirt, which was a glorious glazed mahogany, her multi-coloured missoni blouse, which was a knock-off, and her appetite for all things lovely and lively, which was and still is her most fabulous accessory... jean seberg’s t-shirt in breathless, which said new york herald tribune and spelt new-world style in the old-world style capital... my school friend martha, who at 16 wore a peruvian poncho as a skirt and looked soignée... my father’s giant box of oil pastels, which at the age of three or four i often played with, arranging and rearranging the rods of colour until my fingers were muddy... posted by the sartorialist at 6:07 pm 26 comments contest update 12/20 i have just posted the entries that had not been verified with an email. that takes the total number of responses to almost 350!!! thanks so much! posted by the sartorialist at 6:01 pm 0 comments the sartorialist on paris vogue.com !!!! anyone who has been watching this blog for a while can just imagine how excited i am to be on paris vogue.com. it just went up today and though i can't read what it actually says, what i imagine it says is just fine with me! check it out here. paris vogue.com posted by the sartorialist at 5:32 pm 43 comments the sartorialist contest w/ the new, signed bruce weber book as the prize i was in miami this weekend for art basel and had the chance to attend the book signing for bruce weber's new book "sex and words". of course i was thinking about my readers and thought "how can i use this opportunity to benefit them and thank them for all their support?" then i got an idea a contest! a really easy contest that everyone can participate in. here it is in the comments section of this post please respond to the following "what has most inspired your personal style?" this could be your grandma, or a movie, a band, a designer or whatever. i think it will be really interesting to read what inspires your style plus you can win a really cool book. important - please leave your response in the comments section and then copy it and email it to me so i can match it up and send the prize to the right person. i will not post a response until i receive the email . please put contest in the subject line the winner will be announced on dec. 20th ( in time for holiday gift giving or receiving) i will begin with my response giorgio armani ads of the 80's were incredibly influential on my early style development. the ads then were mostly shot by aldo fallai and were so beautiful (usually black & white). i could relate to what i was seeing in the ads, they were full of people and place that kinda looked like my life - only better. this is how the bruce weber website describes the book: “sex and words” is a limited-edition book of bruce weber photographs inspired by the writings of d.h. lawrence. in the context of weber’s catalogue of publications, this delicate volume features a unique construction. sixteen black and white and three color plates are juxtaposed with selections from “lady chatterley’s lover,” “women in love” and “sons and lovers.” adjacent pages within the volume are interspersed with illustrated vellum sheets that play off the naturalism and sensuality of the photos and text. this is a limited print run of 2000 books ps for those of you that don't win but still want the book i have two other signed copies that i will auction off especially for the sartorialist readers on ebay. i will place the link here when it is set good luck posted by the sartorialist at 5:00 pm 350 comments on the street...perfect androgyny, part 2 this look is so perfectly androgynous that i will let it be my mens and women's post this morning. labels: men new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:01 am 102 comments contest winner announced tonight! wow! what great participation for this contest! i loved reading all the posts. tomorrow i will post the additional 100-ish posts that i was not able to post because i did not receive the email confirmation (they are also great) i think this contest thing went really well, i think we should do some more! i also bought the new hedi slimane book "portrait of a performer" featuring courtney love. i think it might be a good prize for the next contest. actually, what i really love is that i think most of you really didn't care about the prize but just wanted to share, i could really feel the heartfelt sentiments in your stories. i have a few other questions that might make for interesting responses but if you have any contest questions that you feel might make for good participation please let me know. thanks again everyone scott here is a link about the hedi slimane book "portrait of a performer, courtney love / hedi slimane" posted by the sartorialist at 7:07 am 4 comments tuesday, december 19, 2006 vanity fair january 2007 i saw this shot in the current vanity fair and thought he looked like such an original brooks brothers sartorialist. for those of you that thought american men would never wear thom browne, well, we already have. look at how high the pant leg is on his shin. and look at how high the shirt cuff rides up his forearm. i also thought it was interesting that his jacket sleeve only has two buttons. posted by the sartorialist at 6:19 pm 26 comments momma was a rock n' roller posted by the sartorialist at 6:05 pm 37 comments on the street...57th st, new york it is actually a dark purple jacket which is a nice shot of color for a gentleman's wardrobe. posted by the sartorialist at 8:36 am 21 comments on the street...mercer street, new york reversible daryl k dress posted by the sartorialist at 8:33 am 17 comments monday, december 18, 2006 on the street...at nolita art show, new york posted by the sartorialist at 5:33 pm 39 comments on the street...outside apple, new york marc jacobs jacket posted by the sartorialist at 5:18 pm 31 comments on the street...more flea chic, new york well played sir posted by the sartorialist at 8:08 am 31 comments the sartorialist is 50% bigger!! i listen to you and you wanted larger photos - now you got it! i hadn't done it before because i was a little worried about the amount of disk space i would get from blogger but it hasn't created a problem yet so i'm going for it. i was also a little worried about the larger photos taking longer to load but i haven't had any complaints since doing a few protos over the last week. just click on the image for the larger version. i hope you like it. also if all continues on pace, i will also soon introduce a few new features that i think/hope you will really enjoy. these new features are a direct response to emails i have received from you over the last year. thanks again to everyone for all your support and participation posted by the sartorialist at 8:02 am 25 comments on the street...two chic for soho , new york i couldn't wait to post this shot!
