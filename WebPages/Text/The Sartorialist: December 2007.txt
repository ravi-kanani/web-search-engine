i also love my two pair of vass shoes. some of their styles are a bit clunky but some are perfectly chic and sleek. i know bergdorf use to carry vass but where can i still buy them in the us? just about the only "must have" item for a true sartorialist is a good set of shoes trees for all of their shoes. women, wondering what to get your guy for the holidays - shoe trees!! it is the kind of thing that is not fun to buy for yourself but as a "secret santa" or "stocking stuffer" they are great does anyone have a recommendation for a good online source for quality shoe trees? maybe it is just me but i hate split toe shoes trees, they just look and feel cheap. i have had the solid-toe (above) shoe tree for years and it really does the trick. would you rather have a closet full of wooden hangers or top quality wood shoe trees? for me, the answer is shoe trees posted by the sartorialist at 9:21 am 79 comments on the street..... cdg tailoring, london posted by the sartorialist at 8:11 am 38 comments sunday, december 16, 2007 on the street.....melanie, paris posted by the sartorialist at 12:27 pm 66 comments on the street.....photographer, paris i don't think i have ever posted this photo but i found it again while reviewing images on this grey gloomy sunday. the entire photo is all about that cigarette dangling from her mouth while she focuses the shot. update someone asked if i would still take this photo if she wasn't smoking yes, if she was blowing a bubble with gum! posted by the sartorialist at 12:20 pm 64 comments saturday, december 15, 2007 from the frieze art fair, london posted by the sartorialist at 11:21 am 46 comments friday, december 14, 2007 on the street....sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 6:52 am 81 comments thursday, december 13, 2007 on the street....sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 10:46 am 176 comments on the street....sodermalm, stockholm posted by the sartorialist at 10:44 am 70 comments tuesday, december 11, 2007 from the frieze art fair, london while i am traveling to stockholm i thought it would be a good time to share a few of the images i shot for vogue nippon at the frieze art fair. posted by the sartorialist at 8:09 am 90 comments monday, december 10, 2007 black coat monday......black & brown, midtown look how beautifully that coat is shaped in the torso. ps please no pant length comments phil has lost a little weight so his pants keep sliding down his newly svelte frame posted by the sartorialist at 9:09 am 53 comments black coat monday......madison ave., nyc posted by the sartorialist at 8:12 am 77 comments sunday, december 09, 2007 on the street.....greene st., soho posted by the sartorialist at 8:42 am 69 comments on the street.....mory on madison ave., midtown it was so cold this past week that i spent a bit of time stopping into stores to warm-up. of course, i had to stop in and see mory and ,of course, he looked great. while i was there his uncle "some kinda blue" popped by in all his electric blue glory. again, i guess it runs in the family. posted by the sartorialist at 8:27 am 94 comments friday, december 07, 2007 on the street.....some kinda blue, midtown posted by the sartorialist at 8:06 am 131 comments on the street.....off madison ave., uptown posted by the sartorialist at 7:22 am 68 comments thursday, december 06, 2007 on the street.....park ave., uptown posted by the sartorialist at 6:56 pm 94 comments on the street.....winter white, uptown posted by the sartorialist at 8:37 am 143 comments on the street.....madison ave., uptown posted by the sartorialist at 8:36 am 60 comments on the street.....silver & grey, manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 8:29 am 37 comments the sartorialist jr. one of the few projects i wish i had done better was sartorialist jr. for cookie magazine. it is very difficult to regularly find enough kids to shoot for an almost monthly magazine. i love cookie, they do a great job, but i just couldn't keep up. anyway, here are a few images that probably would have gone into a fall/winter issue. posted by the sartorialist at 8:07 am 49 comments wednesday, december 05, 2007 next week stockholm! what i really love is the yellow, blue and green color combo and the hair. while i was looking for a different image i found this one that i missed posting last time i was in stockholm. this in turn reminded me to mention that next week i will be in stockholm for a few days. posted by the sartorialist at 6:16 pm 44 comments on the street.....karla & amelia, manhattan the enlarging issue seems to be fixed - let me know if it is not working for you posted by the sartorialist at 7:19 am 72 comments silver & brown for men, manhattan i love this menswear silver (light grey) & brown combo, remember the nov. 28th post of the the young lady in silver & brown. the pattern mix of scarf and vest interior is also very well done. posted by the sartorialist at 7:01 am 42 comments monday, december 03, 2007 sartorialist super all-star - bfm, upper east side fyi - blogger changed some photo formatting the other day so the enlarging issue is out of my control right now. i'm not happy with the download thing either by the way. i'm sure/hopeful that we will be able to figure a way around this issue so just hold tight for a few days. for today i have someone manually changing the code so check back later if you want to see todays posts larger. posted by the sartorialist at 10:55 pm 47 comments on the street.....little 20's, little 70's, little pink doc martens, nolita posted by the sartorialist at 10:51 pm 47 comments sunday, december 02, 2007 on the street.....mother & daughter,howard st. posted by the sartorialist at 10:27 pm 130 comments newer posts older posts
