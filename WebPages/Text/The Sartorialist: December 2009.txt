i see they've dropped dries van noten but picked-up amber valetta's new collection...interesting. posted by the sartorialist at 10:19 am 139 comments wednesday, december 16, 2009 on the street....the stillness, melbourne posted by the sartorialist at 12:03 pm 219 comments tuesday, december 15, 2009 on the street....chapel st., melbourne posted by the sartorialist at 2:05 pm 771 comments on the street....melbourne man, melbourne i have heard a few concerns lately that this blog has become too heavily dominated by women's images. they worry about the "direction" of the blog. well, i can say that the direction has absolutely remained the same. i've always only shot what i really love and that sincerity remains intact. last week ,in sydney, i didn't see any guys to shoot,, so....no guys shots. it would have been easy to take a few shots just to keep the mens audience happy but i just can't do that. i'm not saying that there are no stylish men in sydney but that i just didn't run across any while i was there. the honest nature of this blog is that the images are a by-product of the cities i visit. some cities are very strong in womens (paris) and some in men's (milano). i always keep my eyes wide open in every city but that element of chance is what keeps this job fun. anyway, early next month i will be at pitti uomo (in florence) which is the best mens shooting i do all year. so if you're needing your classico fix just hang in there guys. posted by the sartorialist at 10:21 am 172 comments monday, december 14, 2009 on the street....everyday couture, sydney vintage lingerie is still easily available at most good vintage shops. it is always shocking to me the level of handwork that use to go into ,basically, everyday underwear. for our lingerie experts do you think this is just a design detail or a very elaborate mending job? when i was in college i learned a lot of couture sewing techniques. if i had ever turned in a garment with the hand-stitching so visible ,as the garment above, i would had gotten an f! however, the fact that you can see the hand-stitching in a garment like this is what makes it so charming and romantic. posted by the sartorialist at 11:35 am 168 comments friday, december 11, 2009 on the street....the accountant, sydney posted by the sartorialist at 11:09 am 330 comments thursday, december 10, 2009 on the street....the horticulturists, sydney this young lady plants rooftop gardens for a living. posted by the sartorialist at 3:03 pm 155 comments wednesday, december 09, 2009 on the street....the young stockbroker, sydney posted by the sartorialist at 2:15 pm 287 comments tuesday, december 08, 2009 on the street....so simple, so perfect, sydney posted by the sartorialist at 2:38 pm 187 comments monday, december 07, 2009 on the street....the burlesque dancer, sydney posted by the sartorialist at 1:19 pm 173 comments on the street....a very serious young man...., sydney ... who likes wearing his sisters skirt posted by the sartorialist at 8:57 am 171 comments sunday, december 06, 2009 on the beach....red on red, bondi beach, sydney posted by the sartorialist at 3:25 pm 174 comments friday, december 04, 2009 on the street....an american in london, london posted by the sartorialist at 9:13 am 334 comments the sartorialist in australia back to australia!! sass & bide will be hosting my book signing in sydney and melbourne next week. i have also made sure to have at least one day in each city to shoot. i know i will be shooting in sydney on the 6th and 7th and in melbourne on the 11th. i hope to meet some of you in your down under summertime finest. this is the info for the signings - and they are free and open to the public sydney tuesday december 8 6-9pm sass & bide, 132 oxford st, paddington melbourne thursday 10 december 6-9pm sass & bide, gpo, bourke st posted by the sartorialist at 6:06 am 232 comments thursday, december 03, 2009 the master....bill cunningham, paris i was sitting next to mr. cunningham during the viktor & rolf show this past october. it was so charming to see how excited he still gets at a great show. i'm sure it's his natural enthusiasm and not the typical "seen it all before" blase ,so common in fashion, that's kept him going all these years. everytime i think i've accomplished a little something with this blog, i think of him and realize i have another 35 years before i can even start feeling that way. posted by the sartorialist at 5:28 pm 123 comments on the street....brooklyn, new york posted by the sartorialist at 1:27 pm 98 comments on the street....west village, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 8:26 am 193 comments wednesday, december 02, 2009 the sartorialist for gq - outside colette, paris posted by the sartorialist at 5:22 pm 124 comments the sartorialist for gq - outside colette, paris posted by the sartorialist at 1:22 pm 79 comments the sartorialist for gq - outside colette, paris posted by the sartorialist at 10:21 am 83 comments tuesday, december 01, 2009 on the street....so ann d., paris posted by the sartorialist at 5:47 am 143 comments newer posts older posts
