nyc retailers must be drooling over reed krakoffs debut collection. to have a new collection (press!), designed by an already proven (commercially successful!) designer* and backed by a large commercially successful mega-brand (confidence) to offer their customers next fall. yes, retailers will be happy to buy into mr. krakoffs inspired design but they will be even more thrilled to buy into a "new" collection that they believe will be able to deliver on time, not struggle with sizing and fit issues for the first few seasons and be there at the end of the season if things don't work out as planned. unless the prices are through the roof retailers will be buying into the whole package. confidence is something retailers have not been able to buy much of lately. designer, reed krakoff, is in a very enviable position right now. mr. krakoff hit that sweet spot of design that is just aspirational enough while still being something that you can imagine in your everyday life. sometimes creating desire can be so simple....just give us what we want, just slightly better than we could have imagined ourself. that is what this collection seems like to me. *mr. krakoff ,for those of you that don't know, is the man behind the turn around of coach. posted by the sartorialist at 9:02 pm 101 comments on the street.....young parisian, paris posted by the sartorialist at 6:38

mitchell i met elvis a few years back at a thom browne show. i really appreciate his genuine love of style and fashion, he's a real fan. recently we sat down and had a chat for his radio show the treatment. elvis was kind enough to let me post that segment here. i hope you enjoy. also check out the great interview elvis did with jay-z for interview magazine. posted by the sartorialist at 3:18

for a day...can we go back to rio? i tried shooting my march gq page in about 4 different locations but it just wasn't working...and i was running out of time. i had already made the commitment to attend the rio fashion week but i was more than a little nervous that i would find enough in rio to fill my page. after scouting rio for a day (a very hot, uncomfortable day) i returned to the fasano hotel and went straight to the pool. in two seconds i knew that my next page would be all about the pool scene at the fasano in rio. neil barrett, dean caten of dsquared, luca rubinacci and enough local "beautiful people" to fill seven pages of gq. i don't know why but dean caten of dsquared decided to throw a wedding bouquet of flowers to all the "single ladies" at the pool. although this shot is fun, i should have filmed him marching around the pool grabbing the ladies to participate. mr. caten does have an unusual charm with the ladies. i think all you need in rio is a hot bathing suit, cool sunglasses and something to wear to and from the airport. garance also loved the fasano but she loved the fresh coconut drinks even more. here is a link to garance fasano post posted by the

buy gloves right now? it has been snowing all day today....and yet, i can't buy a pair of gloves in new york city. there's something wrong with this system. it seems super ridiculous that the shops are full of spring merchandise right now. do you really want to be buying shorts in this weather? posted by the sartorialist at 2:42 pm 372 comments newer posts older posts
