i thought that, even in paris, you're considered innocent till proven guilty. i always say that sports are so much more evolved in this type of situation than the fashion industry. in sports, when an athlete is accused of something, his teammates and manager usually support the player until the accusations are more deeply investigated. basically, dior just threw their star designer under the bus based on the word of strangers with no "reported" third party eyewitness account of the actual events. that ,to me, is the real issue at this stage of the game. do you think dior did the right thing? i bet the fashion conspiracy theorists are going nuts with potential schemes and dreams about what is really happening behind the scenes of this drama. posted by the sartorialist at 3:41 pm 388 comments prada fall 2011 posted by the sartorialist at 3:19 pm 93 comments on the street....viale piave, milan i love the missoni/zara mix. posted by the sartorialist at 8:31 am 108 comments thursday, february 24, 2011 on the street....modern milan, milan it was only a matter of time before this picture happened. posted by the sartorialist at 4:06 pm 161 comments gucci fall 2011, p.2 posted by the sartorialist at 3:32 pm 110 comments on the street....san babila, milan posted by the sartorialist at 9:08 am 167 comments gucci fall 2011, p.1 gucci, one of the top three shows of the season so far!
