see him in something different it will surprise me a little. posted by the sartorialist at 8:03 am 42 comments tuesday, january 30, 2007 on the street....... saint-honore, paris posted by the

sartorialist at 4:17 pm 34 comments one of my all-time favorite shots this is one of my all-time favorite shots simply because i almost didn't get it. when i am walking on the street i am constantly,constantly, constantly adjusting and readjusting the setting on my camera so i don't have to be messing with them when i stop someone to take their photo. on this morning i knew i walking into the sun for a little while so i did a few adjustments to my setting. it was pretty quiet that morning so i was a little relaxed and not expecting to see much then all of a sudden i see this young lady on her bike. i had no time to do anything but raise the camera and shoot. eight out of ten times i would miss this shot because the focus would be off, or the shot is too blurry or the exposure is overly bright or dark, or i just didn't see the outfit well enough before it was too late. this time it all worked perfectly and i didn't even see the white leather boots she was wearing (to ride her bike!) until i looked at the shot in camera. i love her posture, the bike itself, her hat pulled low, the studious glasses, she just seems so elegant and yet completely sporty. i hate over-preciousness and she seems like the kind of girl that would ride in a convertible with the top and not worry about her hair because she knows she has a great cut. i know i am completely projecting here about what who she is or what she may be like but that is what inspiration is all about. i don't need to know the facts- this unknown woman will live forever in my memory just like this. perfect labels: bicycles, my favorites posted by the sartorialist at 2:02 am 100 comments sunday, january 28, 2007 nick sullivan of esquire click on image to enlarge image. i'm still working on

antwerp posted by the sartorialist at 12:47 pm 30 comments dries van noten shop in paris i hear that dries is preparing to open a new shop in paris. the shop here in antwerp is closed to transition into spring 2007. i will try very hard to get shots of the shop while i am in paris the next few days. most of the photos i am taking here in antwerp will appear on my gq page. i have gotten some great images, a great mix of the cutting edge and the traditional that makes antwerp so interesting. the fashion school here is incredible , it is so inspiring to see how proud the faculty is of their students and how happy the students are to be there. if only project runway could have been based in antwerp! while i was at the school today walter van beirendonck was working very closely with the 4th year students on their final collection. couldn't you just imagine watching him on the students back instead of tim gunn! posted by the sartorialist at 9:54 am 17 comments monday, january 22, 2007 on the street.......goth goddess, antwerp this girl was quite the site walking down a side street with her cape blowing in the wind. what i really like is that she has a goth look but has kept the sweet innocent face. i think that is much more interesting because you don't quite know what you are up against. i was a little ......not nervous....but more guarded when i approached her. i love that this sweet girl was able to keep me a little off-balance. posted by the sartorialist at 10:23 am 92 comments at pitti uomo...pink scarf i notice the pink scarf first but equal to that i also notice his overall well-groomed appearance, but he doesn't seem to fall into the trap of being an over-groomed metrosexual. posted by the sartorialist at 10:00 am 32 comments what????? yesterday i received three hate emails from weirdo's that think i wrote an article about men wearing leggings. personally i don't care if men wear leggings but i feel really sad for the guys that feel compelled to write stupid emails about something so frivolous. are they really afraid that they may soon have to make the decision of which leggings look best with their sportcoats? one guy said i wouldn't last long in his office.....well, i run in leggings, i think that means i would kick his ass twice as fast. sorry for the rant but i hate the fear the runs some peoples lives. if i could figure out how to document it i should wear a pair of leggings with a sportcoat ,like in the marni show, and capture and how people react. i would have to do it in a city like philly or pittsburgh. wasn't that cameo's whole look back in the 80's? has anyone seen the article that these weirdo's are talking about? posted by the sartorialist at 9:58 am 75 comments the sartorialist almost arrested in antwerp!!!! prostitution is legal in antwerp and i think pot is too but don't cross the street against a red light or big trouble! a cop car stopped me today in antwerp because i crossed the street against a "no walk" sign. well, i am a new yorker, sorry but that is what we do. in new york if no traffic is coming and you don't cross the street people will think you may be hurt and will come to your aid. this policeman stopped me not because i had created some type of traffic problem but merely because i had crossed the street against the red "right in front of my nose." he was so mad his hands were shaking while he looked at my id. when he asked for my id i gave him my drivers licenses but he wanted my passport. he really thought he had me when i couldn't find it right away but when i found it he was pissed that he didn't get to take me in to the station house. he asked all kinds of questions like how long i have been in antwerp and why i am here. he was looking for the stamps on my passport and asked why the last one was from 2006. i told him i don't know and that i came here on the train. "from new york by train?" he asked, "no from paris" i said. i was trying really hard not to laugh out loud. "this is very bizarre, let this be a warning!!!"he said and he drove away. that's right, me and 50 cent, we are some bad-ass lawbreakers in antwerp!!! can i come back to new york now? posted by the sartorialist at 8:12 am 97 comments sunday, january 21, 2007 the ralph lauren look at pitti, florence this italian gentleman was the first man i had seen at pitti with worn faded jeans. it is funny when something so common in new york stands out so much in italy. posted by the sartorialist at 11:25 am 24 comments at armani posted by the sartorialist at 11:23 am 30 comments saturday, january 20, 2007 at neil barrett posted by the sartorialist at 1:28 pm 51 comments art basel photos in new gq the new gq with my photos from art basel is out or just about to drop. i saw the issue in milan at a gq party and the page looks great. this time there will be some additional photos available at gq.com posted by the sartorialist at 11:32 am 21 comments thursday, january 18, 2007 at dsquared posted by the sartorialist at 5:16 pm 116 comments at armani posted by the sartorialist at 2:29 am 46 comments wednesday, january 17, 2007 at marni marni's men's show today (their first ever) was really great - right up there with jil sander. ps - please click on image to enlarge and to see a better color version. i have to contact blogger b/c for some reason the images are coming up a little flat on the main page lately. posted by the sartorialist at 4:24 pm 44 comments at valentino posted by the sartorialist at 2:36 am 49 comments tuesday, january 16, 2007 from the car i saw this young lady while i was leaving the dsquared show on the way to valentino. i thought she looked so great i had to try to get a shot. as it turns out, she was headed to the valentino show too. posted by the sartorialist at 5:18 pm 18 comments at bottega veneta posted by the sartorialist at 2:45 am 81 comments monday, january 15, 2007 at burberry posted by the sartorialist at 6:10 pm 40 comments it's her!! after i took this photo carine told me they are using one of my photos of her for an upcoming issue of paris vogue!! posted by the sartorialist at 1:38 am 72 comments the always stylish beppe posted by the sartorialist at 1:10 am 6 comments sunday, january 14, 2007 welcome to milan! at the burberry show posted by the sartorialist at 3:29 pm 38 comments at pitti uomo..studious chic, florence posted by the sartorialist at 1:16 am 35 comments the equestrians......florence, italy i am seeing a lot of equestrian inspired looks in florence for both men and women. posted by the sartorialist at 1:00 am 18 comments friday, january 12, 2007 at pitti uomo...the right amount of cuff this is easily a half inch cuff and it looks perfect....ok, so does everything else. posted by the sartorialist at 1:52 pm 78 comments at pitti uomo...the fur pullover? her top looked and moved like a fur pullover, if it was then it is really cool. it may also be just a fur jacket which would still be pretty cool posted by the sartorialist at 1:20 pm 17 comments at pitti uomo...just adorable posted by the sartorialist at 1:00 pm 24 comments at pitti uomo...florence, italy posted by the sartorialist at 4:10 am 44 comments thursday, january 11, 2007 at pitti uomo...gloves in the chest pocket i have heard about the gloves-in-the-breast-pocket look but i have rarely seen it done successfully. this version, i think, is very well done. click to enlarge. posted by the sartorialist at 1:00 pm 23 comments on the street.......nonna, florence, italy posted by the sartorialist at 11:00 am 45 comments newer posts older posts
