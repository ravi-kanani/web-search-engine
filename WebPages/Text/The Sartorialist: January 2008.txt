anyway, please note that james includes a helmet in is bike rides. apparently the other day he did have a serious spill on his bike and he feels that the helmet really saved him from some major damage. (how dare he do that right before my show!!) james has also recently begun a great blog the year in pictures that gives his unique insight into the world of fine art photography. it's funny when you get to know someone who has a blog because you learn a whole new side of that person that might take years to bring up in normal conversation. dont forget my opening night party for the exhibit the party is open to the public and i hope to see/meet a lot of you there. january 22nd danziger projects 521 w. 26th st 6 - 8pm posted by the sartorialist at 3:50 am 51 comments wednesday, january 16, 2008 at marni...disco helmet, milano posted by the sartorialist at 4:31 pm 67 comments at marni posted by the sartorialist at 1:37 am 31 comments at gucci i love that neck scarf he said it is a regular silk pocket square and that he has a 15.5 shirt size so it sounds very achievable - for the right guys.. posted by the sartorialist at 1:33 am 28 comments tuesday, january 15, 2008 on the street....milanese woman posted by the sartorialist at 12:13 pm 56 comments newer posts older posts
