perfect balance between sporty and proper. fyi - he was wearing black lace-up shoes, but easily could have gone with dark chocolate brown or even a cognac brown shoe. posted by the sartorialist at

thinking of titles for each post, but i thought this one was pretty good. posted by the sartorialist at 5:30 pm 64 comments on the street....the gesture, fabio borrelli, florence i chose fabio to be on my first page in gq two years ago because of total unconscious style like this. "unconscious style" that sounds like a good phrase. anyway, fabio is just full of these little quirks and it is so charming. he almost tries to hide them (if you can hide walking with your hand in your coat?) because he is actually very shy. if you notice i haven't shot him standing still in quite a while because he hates posing for pictures so much. posted by the sartorialist at 8:31 am 84 comments on the street....that smile, florence posted by the sartorialist at 8:30 am 83 comments tuesday, january 13, 2009 on the street.... florence, italy posted by the sartorialist at 5:30 pm 87 comments on the street....for a smaller waist go for strong shoulders, florence we have gotten into a groove of wearing small clothes to portray a vision of a smaller, leaner body. for some people this works, but for most of us we just look like we are stuffed into a "too small" suit. this gentleman creates the illusion of a slim waist by wearing a coat with a slightly extended shoulder. the back belt helps to heighten this illusion. i have to add that this gentleman was very proud of being 52 years old and in great shape due to boxing. if you still have it at that age then flaunt it! posted by the sartorialist at 8:35 am 151 comments on the street....layered greys, florence when you are doing a minimalist look don't forget the importance of texture. here we see one color, but 5 textures of that color - cashmere cardigan, structured base knit, heathered scarf, woven coat and silk lining. each element complementing the others, and yet so subtle that they might individually be missed. i think the key here is that each layer is so thin that they don't create a lot of extra bulk. i hope the guys can also take a little inspiration from this look - i know i have. posted by the sartorialist at 8:30 am 58 comments newer posts older posts
