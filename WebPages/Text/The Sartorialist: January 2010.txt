"manner" or "grace" is not something that you can learn from a book. unfortunately, it is something you just have to be or to develop. a great scene of modern grace on '30 rock' the other day: liz and jack went out to dinner at a very chic restaurant. as they sat down at the table, jack immediately moved the candle from the center of the setting to the side of the table. liz looked at him kinda funny, not understanding why he did that but, not really caring either. later, however, when liz reached across the table to steal some of jack's food (as she always does), she realized he moved the candle so her sleeve wouldn't catch fire when she reached across the table. jack's manner and grace were so attuned to her as a friend, that he knew her moves before she did. that tiny gesture ended up becoming the pivotal moment of the episode and changed the course of their business relationship. i'm telling you guys again, women notice the small stuff. they notice the gentleness/gentlemenliness more than if you use the right fork at dinner. i'm a very lucky man, garance notices every little kindness i offer her, she doesn't miss a thing. knowing that makes it so much more rewarding to do even more little things for her. i'll be honest, my biggest obsession in life right now is not better shoes, more suits or a bigger career but, to simply be a more graceful man for my graceful woman. so women, in the spirit of grace, manner and valentine's day, take a moment and share with us men some of the little kindnesses that your man has done for you that made your heart flutter. us men might learn something and you might gain an even more graceful man, a gentleman. editor's note: for my gay readers, i can only write this as i know it, a man loving a woman. don't let this keep you from joining the conversation. if you have tiny acts of kindness from a boyfriend to a boyfriend, or girlfriend to a girlfriend, please share with us! grace is grace. it doesn't matter who you're lovin', it's how you're lovin'! posted by the sartorialist at 6:16 am 560 comments the mcqueen question. so....now what? i was talking to a retailer yesterday who said that her mcqueen business was growing faster than it ever had before. however, she sees no other option than to close the business of mcqueen. who could take over? should anyone takeover? i'm sure gucci has invested millions in this business but, this isn't the same as finding a replacement for an old house like ysl or kenzo. this is different, very different. i think the closest correlation to this would have to be moschino. and still after all these years, no one has been able to replace him, just a design team. do we really want this to be the fate of mcqueen's business? i mean, come on, who could possibly keep the spirit of mcqueen alive? he was so unique that his replacement could never get out of that shadow. but again, gucci has already spent millions and, in this economy, can anyone just walk away from a growing business? so....now what? posted by the sartorialist at 6:00 am 216 comments friday, january 29, 2010 on the street....after ysl, paris posted by the sartorialist at 10:54 am 258 comments thursday, january 28, 2010 at costume national.....the character, milan posted by the sartorialist at 3:19 pm 174 comments at roberto cavalli....the fashion journalist, milan i actually shot this in milan a few days before i shot kanye in paris . like any artist i follow my inspiration and lately i've been feeling for portraits. i think it started with that "red on red" portrait in sydney. right now i love the idea of a dramatic face surrounded by an equally dramatic fur...a very modern john singer sargent vibe. regarding the kanye shot. yes, kanye is having a tough time right now but i think that makes the portrait all the more moving. for those of you that think the kanye shot was a celebrity grab and a change in direction for the blog, go check the archives. i've shot kanye about ten times over the last two years and his inclusion hasn't changed anything in this blog (if anything it enriches it with a wider stylistic offering). is kanye a sartorialist? who is? i wrote in my book that i appreciate and relate to his struggles to find is own style vocabulary. haven't we all gone through that? am i a yohji or an armani was mine. i know kanye a little bit and that portrait captures something in him i haven't seen before. whether you like him or not is up to you. that shot is just a simple portrait of a man in a difficult moment in his life and as a artist i would be crazy not to react to that moment (especially if it falls within a mood i'm feeling). i love the contrast that these two portraits create. and lets be honest, we can't assume that this woman is any more or less refined or graceful than kanye. i think the not really knowing makes portraits all the more fascinating i wish i had more to say about this lovely woman but she spoke almost no english. my good friend renata (who you'll see in another shot very soon) was the person who really helped make this shot happen. i love the calm poise of this shot even though there are about two hundred people right behind me moving out of a fashion show very very quickly. posted by the sartorialist at 8:26 am 155 comments wednesday, january 27, 2010 at louis vuitton....kanye west, paris posted by the sartorialist at 7:13 pm 548 comments on the street.... so much to see, paris where to start? - the "retro" extended shirt collar - the 3-pc. suit worn without a hint of stuffiness - the simple brown/grey color story - the playfulness of purple socks but the single most important element of this look! - the masterfully/effortlessly rolled (almost punched) brim of his hat. really, doesn't that one element of his look tell you everything you need to know about this gentleman? posted by the sartorialist at 2:10 pm 152 comments on the street....alessandra, milano the thing with alessandra is, when i think of how to describe her style i wouldn't use descriptions of her favorite colors, proportions or genres. i would have to use terms like sexy, approachable, androgynous, playful. funny how someones personality can actually become their style. sounds simply but it isn't. posted by the sartorialist at 7:01 am 211 comments tuesday, january 26, 2010 on the street....after dries van noten, paris posted by the sartorialist at 4:30 pm 110 comments on the street....le marais, paris posted by the sartorialist at 9:28 am 166 comments monday, january 25, 2010 on the street...... tough enough for fashion, pitti uomo posted by the sartorialist at 4:39 pm 205 comments on the street......in grey & red, pitti uomo posted by the sartorialist at 10:25 am 184 comments friday, january 22, 2010 on the street......winter's best, pitti uomo posted by the sartorialist at 8:44 am 156 comments thursday, january 21, 2010 on the street......before armani, milano posted by the sartorialist at 4:34 pm 214 comments on the street......pattern master, pitti uomo posted by the sartorialist at 3:58 am 180 comments wednesday, january 20, 2010 on the street......after d&g, milan posted by the sartorialist at 2:54 pm 230 comments on the street......via montenapoleone, milano posted by the sartorialist at 7:52 am 83 comments tuesday, january 19, 2010 on the street....lapo, florence posted by the sartorialist at 3:37 pm 308 comments on the street....via manzoni, milano posted by the sartorialist at 2:28 am 281 comments monday, january 18, 2010 on the street...mr. hackett, pitti uomo posted by the sartorialist at 4:35 pm 141 comments on the street....manù, milano posted by the sartorialist at 10:37 am 144 comments sunday, january 17, 2010 hi from milano posted by the sartorialist at 6:40 am 413 comments friday, january 15, 2010 at pitti uomo.....turtlenecks & green, florence this shot captures two of the biggest trends i've seen on the gentleman of pitti uomo this season. first, green as an impact color. i don't know if it's just me or if all the really cool guys seem to be working a dash of green into their best looks lately. second, turtlenecks in every proportion. either big and chunky and worn with a peacoat/ parka or slim and sleek and worn with a suit or sportscoat. posted by the sartorialist at 2:51 am 186 comments thursday, january 14, 2010 on the beach..footvolley, rio de janeiro posted by the sartorialist at 9:33 pm 173 comments on the beach....joana,rio de janeiro p.3 posted by the sartorialist at 4:29 pm 194 comments welcome to pitti uomo 2010, florence posted by the sartorialist at 7:24 am 132 comments wednesday, january 13, 2010 on the beach....sometimes this is the only suit you need, rio de janeiro posted by the sartorialist at 4:00 pm 246 comments on the street....joana, rio de janeiro p.2 posted by the sartorialist at 7:24 am 256 comments tuesday, january 12, 2010 on the street....the barber, rio de janeiro posted by the sartorialist at 4:01 pm 141 comments at rio fashion....andrea dellal, rio de janeiro posted by the sartorialist at 7:32 am 173 comments monday, january 11, 2010 at rio fashion...luca rubinacci, rio de janeiro posted by the sartorialist at 2:13 pm 146 comments at rio fashion....joana, my new style star, brazil this is the first moment i saw joana. ok, truth be told, garance and i ran away from the winters cold to rio fashion week in brazil. it's hot down here....i mean, crazy hot!! however we still met several really cooool girls down here. just like eva, or giovanna, or anna della russo, joana is one of those girls that i become instantly curious about. everyday i want to see what she's is wearing. being brazilian, joana is great at color, accessories, prints and just the right amount of sexiness. she has a superior taste level and an undeiniable charm...basically, she is as nice as she looks. i have a few more shot of her to share over the next few days. by the time you read this though, i will be flying to florence for pitti uomo. this week will be an interestng mix of high summer rio style and full-on florence winter chic. ps. i will have a book signing in florence at luisa vis roma on january 14th at 6:30pm. i will do another post about this event tomorrow with more details. posted by the sartorialist at 7:34 am 253 comments friday, january 08, 2010 on the street....26th st. flea market, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 7:03 am 186 comments thursday, january 07, 2010 the girl from that little vintage store on baker street, melbourne posted by the sartorialist at 11:20 am 193 comments wednesday, january 06, 2010 on the street....madison ave., new york city all about the green hat. posted by the sartorialist at 7:13 am 203 comments tuesday, january 05, 2010 on the street....broadway, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 2:09 pm 189 comments on the street....sixth ave., nyc posted by the sartorialist at 8:15 am 214 comments newer posts older posts
