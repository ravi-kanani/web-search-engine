one of the most asked questions to style experts is "should my socks match my shoes or my pants?" the answer you get may depend on where you live. the americans (top photo) advice matching socks to your pants, the italians (bottom photo) seem to contrast with both shoes and pants. the english , always the eccentrics, wear maroon socks with everything! i have a photo to defend this point but i will have to post it later due to problems with my laptop - stupid laptop! posted by the sartorialist at 8:03 pm 67 comments on the street.......white dress posted by the sartorialist at 6:14 pm 18 comments on the street........midtown, new york i guess this goes back to the slim shorts questions. a lot of you mentioned just cutting off pants which is what this gentleman has appeared to do and looks great. another appearance of top-siders in the city. posted by the sartorialist at 9:15 am 42 comments my photo shoot for menswear magazine so yesterday i was on the other side of the camera having my portrait taken for menswear magazine. since they wanted my camera in the shot i thought i would just shoot while i was being shot - confusing? makeup - actually this is not the makeup they used on me. my makeup was by a company called sherwin-williams? i don't know much about makeup but they said it gave me a shiny coat and that it won't chip or peel in the most extreme conditions! this is me after makeup but before changing into my bob mackie original gown! i never go anywhere without my softbox and scrim. didn't veerland say something like "beauty is all in the lighting" ? the lovely photographer deborah feingold and tom beebe quietly discussing how to get out of this shoot after reviewing a few of the first shots the doggy that did wonders to bring a sense of calm and joy to the shoot. posted by the sartorialist at 8:32 am 11 comments thursday, july 27, 2006 at the collective - the new american banker i loved this guys take on the "american banker" look. i had seen him later in the day and his bowtie was still perfectly askew. posted by the sartorialist at 6:23 pm 25 comments another great seersucker suit for summer i love this seersucker tie posted by the sartorialist at 9:01 am 23 comments on the street........meatpacking district, new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:58 am 28 comments wednesday, july 26, 2006 question from the sartorialist email - slim shorts for men i have not done this before and i'm not really an advice guy but i often get emails asking style questions so i thought it would be fun to post this one. dear sartorialist i love your blog ts. it's just wonderful! it's really a gift! can you help me. i'm trying to find men's shorts that are tapered like italian slacks. thin in the leg instead of the ridiculous blouson shorts made by every single american manufacturer (and many european ones as well). i buy most of my suits/pants at eredi pisano. they have shorts in their catalog but you can't get them here. burberry's has some thin ones but they are only so so. borrelli's are wide (surprising). any ideas? dear reader i don't know where to find truly tapered shorts (some of the madras seem a little more slim if you like madras) but shorter shorts are on the horizon which will have a more slimming effect. think tennis shorts - i saw a few editors in europe during the mens shows doing it and i'm now seeing realistic versions in the showrooms. here is a guy at the junya watanabe show wear the shorter short successfully photo courtesy the sartorialist on men.style.com thanks for the question, i hope it helps. do any of the readers have a suggestion on slim shorts? posted by the sartorialist at 6:52 pm 40 comments on the street........paris on bleeker, west village, new york i don't know why this feels like the kind of shot i would have gotten in paris. posted by the sartorialist at 6:28 pm 16 comments at the collective - green seersucker suit first of all, great cut and great fit on this suit - pant length just about perfect this is this gentleman's second time on the sartorialist (i also featured him during fashion week back in feb, he was wearing a great bowtie then also) i love that his style is just this side of dandy. the cut and shape and quality are all very respectable but he makes this look outstanding by choosing a reasonable shade of green and then pairing it with high-quality, serious accessories. in the wrong hands this could have gone clownish but he really pulls it off. he has also created a signature for himself with his elegant bowtie. if you think about it most guys with great style have something that is their signature, (a color or brand or an accessory) it may be subtle but it is always there. do you know what your sartorial signature is? mine is always having a camera stuck to my hand! he really could have messed up the whole look with the pocket square choice but instead of going outlandish he went subtle and choose an edging that complimented the tone of the green and even compliments the tone of his shoe color. very well done - and a nice way to advance seersucker past just blues and tans. posted by the sartorialist at 8:53 am 35 comments the sartorialist on slate.com justin shubow just wrote a really great piece on slate.com that gives an overview of the "street fashion blogs" from all around the world. here is a link better than a park bench posted by the sartorialist at 8:48 am 13 comments on the street........fashion insiders working wardrobe, new york what do you wear when you work in a creative field but maybe not in the creative department? this woman was walking out of the #1 fashion building on 7th ave (nyers will know which one) and she really looked great - so well put together. i have no idea what she does but i thought she doesn't necessarily look like a designer but a designer would love to have someone that looked like her (or should i say has her type of style) managing his/her business, or pr, or whatever. ps. the dress comes up a little darkin the photo but there is a great pleating detail at the center of the neckline that really makes the dress pop. posted by the sartorialist at 8:00 am 15 comments tuesday, july 25, 2006 on the street........grey denim, new york maybe i'm not a big denim guy but i haven't seen a lot of dark grey unwashed(?) denim. this is one of those pure inspiration posts - i don't know if i would wear this look but i love the dark grey denim with the brown leather boots. it makes me want to find some dark grey denim (maybe apc) and work it with brown shoes, socks (maybe), blue button down-shirt, navy blazer, and a crisp white pocket square for fall. a younger, sportier alternative to grey flannel pants. it is like 100 degrees in new york and i'm already thinking fall!! a lot of times when i shoot something it is because i'm trying to figure out how i can use a detail from that look to effect my own wardrobe - this is a great example. posted by the sartorialist at 5:50 pm 22 comments on the street........the marais, paris posted by the sartorialist at 4:57 pm 18 comments monday, july 24, 2006 at the collective - cotton suit posted by the sartorialist at 5:58 pm 18 comments on the street.... 39th street flea market, new york posted by the sartorialist at 5:00 pm 15 comments at the collective - navy jacket w/ matching navy tie notice both are wearing spread collars shirts, both wear white pocket squares and both have the tie slightly darker than the jacket and both stand in an almost identical manner. birds of a feather. here is how to tell them apart - don't you think this could be a perfect example of how a person chooses to fold their pocket square can speak volumes about that persons personality?
