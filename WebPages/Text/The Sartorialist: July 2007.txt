i have tremendous respect for that. the guy is in his 70's and is still sweating all the little details. posted by the sartorialist at 8:02 am 75 comments introducing - the sartorialist women's i am happy to begin the sartorialist women's same concept as the men's sartorialist plus two additional services. as with the men's list i will try to get a good mix of ladies from varied income levels. i am currently efforting responses from women in new york, milan, paris, london and stockholm (berlin?). i will be updating the sartorialist as i receive answers but quite a few will be going up in the next two weeks. of course, i had to start with a few of the coolest women i know. carine roitfeld hair salon romain color -

all tall and still wearing their pants at their waist (with very successful results) posted by the sartorialist at 7:46 am 23 comments thursday, july 26, 2007 sartorialist lesson #1 - wear your pants on your waist not your hips the easiest and least expensive way for any gentleman to look much better in his clothes is to pull those pants up. both of these gentleman look more refined ,even while dressed in just shirt sleeves, because they are wearing their pants at their waist and not at their hips. i think it also visually drops about ten pounds on a guy because your shirt doesn't blouse-out and hang over your belt as badly. posted by the sartorialist at 9:26 am 108 comments on the street.......yohji femme, soho posted by the sartorialist at 9:20 am 28 comments wednesday, july 25, 2007 at valentino....leopard tie, milan posted by the sartorialist at 8:53 am 72 comments on the street.......bold is beautiful, harlem posted by the sartorialist at 8:52 am 51 comments on the street.......sunday's best 3, harlem posted by the sartorialist at 8:51 am 72 comments on the street.......go-to summer dress, milan posted by the sartorialist at 8:49 am 31 comments tuesday, july 24, 2007 on the street.......spring street, soho posted by the sartorialist at 8:57 am 60 comments on the street.......sunday's best 2, harlem posted by the sartorialist at 8:55 am 33 comments update congrats to michael bastian -new designer for bill blass for my august gq page i talk about the particular to manhattan look of guys running out of the office on "early friday's" in rigs that are somewhere between manhattan and the hamptons a.k.a manhattan beach. posted by the sartorialist at 5:48 am 45 comments monday, july 23, 2007 live and let loose p2 i know i'm fickle but all it takes is seeing a guy like this (looking really cool in in a loose silhouette) to reconsider my my love of the slim italian classics. you have to admit that this guy looks pretty cool and comfortable. posted by the sartorialist at 6:02 pm 62 comments on the street.......summer knits, greenwich village posted by the sartorialist at 5:53 pm 36 comments on the street.......sunday's best, harlem posted by the sartorialist at 9:19 am 77 comments on the street.......bleecker st., west village simple summer black dress taken to a whole new level with the artfully layered necklaces posted by the sartorialist at 9:16 am 31 comments on the street.......shades of denim, paris posted by the sartorialist at 7:42 am 27 comments sunday, july 22, 2007 some kinda blue posted by the sartorialist at 11:36 am 37 comments at marni, p2 posted by the sartorialist at 11:07 am 35 comments saturday, july 21, 2007 live and let loose posted by the sartorialist at 9:18 am 32 comments at marni posted by the sartorialist at 9:15 am 20 comments friday, july 20, 2007 fabrizio in paris as we saw yesterday -

considering ribbon belts variation on a theme i really love ribbon belts. i think they add a nice touch of color to a casual summer look and replace the element of color you might lose not wearing a tie. the gentlemen below do a great job working them into their looks in a way that is not too obvious and that harmonize well with the other colors and patterns they're wearing. personally ,in the summer, i wear a lot of solid colors - navy, white, khaki, grey - so i am always looking for accessories that can add a little color to my look but ,again, in a subtle way. remember those color bracelets michael macko was wearing? unfortunately for me i have always found ribbon belts too wide for my size. that is, until i found this belt at brooks brothers which is a typical ribbon (or actually woven tie silk) belt but it is unlined so i can scrunch it down a bit to make it much thinner. it takes the effect of fred astaire and his tie-as-belt look. i will probably remove the d-rings and tie the belt kinda like astaire but i think it will read more sporty and not too precious. posted by the sartorialist at 7:38 am 55 comments newer posts older posts
