i'll be in toronto tomorrow (wednesday the 22nd) and i'd love to meet some of my readers! i will be at holt renfrew on bloor street from 12:30 pm - 2 pm (on the menswear floor) on wednesday afternoon. also tomorrow evening we will be having a very non-organized gathering at the bar in the drake hotel (1150 queen street west), starting around 9:30 or 10pm. posted by the sartorialist at 8:45 am 125 comments on the street......beaded vest, milano posted by the sartorialist at 8:00 am 93 comments monday, july 20, 2009 on the street......eva, paris during the men's shows in milan and paris i did a little double duty and shot a story for italian elle with eva. she is truly a charmer and the only woman i know that can wear the kookiest hat (or bunny ears) while working very hard and not give the hat a second thought all day. i'll post a few of the "behind the scenes" shots from the shoot in the evenings this week. posted by the sartorialist at 7:31 am 163 comments the book has arrived! well what can i say - the book is starting to roll off the presses. penguin just sent me one of the first printed copies. it is so crazy to actually be holding the book i have been working on since january. i know i took all of the pictures, i remember taking each one, but i still can't believe i took all of the photographs. tracy is holding the paperback version, and soon i will have a copy of the limited-edition hardcover with slipcase to show you. this has been a labor of love. taking the pictures, editing the pictures, arranging the pictures, doing most of the writing while i was still in phoenix after my dad died. it's hard to put into words how one feels looking at their own work presented like this - so i won't even try. i hope you enjoy the book and i will keep you posted about the book signing tour, the sartorialust pop-up shops, and any other events surrounding the launch of the book. below are links to some sites where you can pre-order the book. it comes out august 12th in the us, and worldwide by early september. amazon (us) amazon (uk) amazon (fr) barnes and noble bol borders (us) borders (uk) foyles indie bound waterstones posted by the sartorialist at 7:03 am 316 comments on the street......the character, bologna i only had one day in bologna, but i made it work for me. i think bologna is a really beautiful city and i look forward to making it a regular stop on my way from florence to milan. it is so easy to take the train between these cities, but next time i think i will take a car. from the train it looks like the most perfect region of italy. posted by the sartorialist at 6:47 am 79 comments thursday, july 16, 2009 on the street......jump, paris posted by the sartorialist at 11:52 pm 167 comments on the street......legs, milano posted by the sartorialist at 11:50 pm 102 comments on the street......mid-summer white, paris posted by the sartorialist at 5:10 pm 102 comments wednesday, july 15, 2009 on the street......marais, paris posted by the sartorialist at 9:00 am 199 comments on the street......brown & blue, florence yes, the suit is very nice but it's really about the hair, right? posted by the sartorialist at 8:35 am 265 comments tuesday, july 14, 2009 on the street......black & white, milano posted by the sartorialist at 10:10 am 150 comments on the street......tonal, paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:15 am 75 comments monday, july 13, 2009 on the street......paris in bloom posted by the sartorialist at 8:31 am 219 comments on the street......american classics, paris we have all seen this type of look before, but rarely done so well. this is all about execution. posted by the sartorialist at 6:32 am 70 comments saturday, july 11, 2009 on the street......waiter at caffe florian, venice it seems every time i return from italy i want to watch "the talented mr. ripley" to see if my italy was as beautiful as the italy in that movie. in one of the final scenes of the movie marge has coffee with dickie's dad at caffe florian on san marco square in venice. that spot is still so beautiful (if you can block out the tourists). this young waiter was standing at the cafe and instantly i thought of the movie and how this "type" of young man has probably been working the cafe florian for the last 100 years. posted by the sartorialist at 8:46 am 83 comments friday, july 10, 2009 on the street......balman, paris posted by the sartorialist at 5:45 pm 210 comments on the street......ninth ave., nyc posted by the sartorialist at 8:41 am 134 comments on the street......belted jacket, paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:40 am 32 comments thursday, july 09, 2009 at prada....cut-off shorts, milano i loved the cut-off dress pant shorts at prada. a great way to take the cut-off khakis to the next level. i had a great seat at prada, but by the time i realized how cool the shorts were i couldn't change the settings on my camera fast enough to get a great image. (photo brazenly stolen from men.style.com, sorry) wouldn't this cut-off idea be a great way to update those prada pants from last summer. posted by the sartorialist at 5:35 pm 83 comments on the street......milano goes green, milano posted by the sartorialist at 8:55 am 92 comments on the street......summer black, paris it is so tough to make an all black outfit not look oppressive in the summer heat. i think the subtle fact that darcy has a very open neckline really makes her look feel more open and easy. "makes her look feel," that's a funny phrase. i think a lot of times we decide how much we like a "look" based on how it must "feel" to wear it. posted by the sartorialist at 8:47 am 43 comments wednesday, july 08, 2009 at dior i really loved the idea of the sheer jackets at dior. with the transparency of the jackets it would have been interesting to play with contrast colors for the layering pieces. at least that is what i would do if/when i buy this jacket. posted by the sartorialist at 5:32 pm 99 comments on the street......silver top to toe, paris posted by the sartorialist at 9:51 am 64 comments on the street......lino of milano! i don't know how he stays so cool in the heat of milan. posted by the sartorialist at 8:00 am 78 comments tuesday, july 07, 2009 something in the air? lanvin, paris another great collection from lanvin - one of the top shows in paris this season. like bv, a mix of bold reds and purples played against a tranquil desert of neutrals. i am very happy that the david letterman-style of db buttoning has been picked up by lanvin this season. mark my words, next season lanvin will replace the current patent leather sneakers with patent leather wrestling shoes, circa letterman 1985. posted by the sartorialist at 5:14 pm 47 comments on the street......short cycle, paris these rental bikes are changing my relationship with paris. before i felt so trapped by the lack of taxis and a challenging subway system (those connecting tunnels are the devil). this past men's season i started using these bikes, and now i feel a power of control over getting from one place to the next easily. new york is aggressively expanding it's bicycle lanes all over the city. does anyone know if we are scheduled to get rental bikes? anyway, i hope if we are that we can look as chic as this young man. posted by the sartorialist at 7:06 am 133 comments on the street......raider nation, paris posted by the sartorialist at 7:04 am 44 comments monday, july 06, 2009 bottega veneta.... best of milan? i really thought bottega veneta was the best show in milan. the use of color (both bold and neutral), the prints and the surface textures were superb. there are very few shows i see that (at some point) stop being a show, and start being a personal shopping preview. posted by the sartorialist at 5:30 pm 93 comments newer posts older posts
