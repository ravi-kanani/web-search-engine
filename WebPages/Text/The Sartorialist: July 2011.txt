the subject line of the email should read "vintage photo" - the photos will only be posted here on the blog, so the file size can be very small (no bigger than 700kb). i do not need hi-res images, they take too long to download. - writing a little something about the image you send will make your entry much more interesting for all of us. - email your photos to: sartorialistvintagephotos@gmail.com posted by the sartorialist at 9:07 am 75 comments saturday, july 16, 2011 vintage photos posted by the sartorialist at 4:10 pm 49 comments vintage photos i love the old school swimsuits posted by the sartorialist at 10:07 am 52 comments friday, july 15, 2011 on the street....houston st., new york posted by the sartorialist at 3:30 pm 93 comments on the street...elizabeth street, new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:42 am 118 comments thursday, july 14, 2011 on the street....before pringle, milano posted by the sartorialist at 4:30 pm 84 comments on the street....via turati, milan posted by the sartorialist at 3:30 pm 60 comments on the street......via fogazzaro, milan posted by the sartorialist at 8:39 am 145 comments wednesday, july 13, 2011 on the street....all blue, florence posted by the sartorialist at 4:30 pm 83 comments on the street....retro blue, florence posted by the sartorialist at 3:30 pm 87 comments on the street....via del fossi, florence posted by the sartorialist at 8:15 am 76 comments tuesday, july 12, 2011 on the street....simone, florence posted by the sartorialist at 4:30 pm 84 comments on the street....angelika, milan posted by the sartorialist at 9:37 am 135 comments monday, july 11, 2011 on the street....urban explorer, florence i love the simple urban explorer feel of this look, the slate green shirt with the classic but slightly fuller cut khakis is perfection in its stealth. however, i think the photograph - and the look itself - is made measurably more refined by its juxtaposition with the rugged grooming. it is such an art to be well-groomed but not manscaped. this is one of the best examples i've seen in a while. posted by the sartorialist at 5:12 pm 120 comments july 4th weekend in capri over july 4th weekend, tod's invited garance and myself to capri for the opening of their jackie onassis photo exhibit. as you can imagine, the images are beautiful, inspiring, and poetic; see garance's post, here. mr. della valle and crew were incredible hosts and allowed us to see a side of capri that a first-time visitor rarely experiences. for a location as famous as capri to live up to decades of hype seemed impossible, and yet it was even more enchanting than i had expected. this rugged landscape has been tamed by the luxurious italian lifestyle: food, architecture, the highest standard of living. capri will be high on my list of favorite locations, going forward. a big big thanks to diego, andrea, sarika, and mariacristina. the bougainvillea flowed down the architecture and mountainside like a beautiful floral fog. super-host diego della valle. lee radziwill at the exhibit's opening party. walking around capri, you really have to keep your eyes open. every corner you turn there is a new tableau. aerial view (well, actually - from just really high up the mountainside!) of the world-famous la fontelina lido. this shot is really for garance. a native corsican, she has taught me to appreciate the diversity of flora and fauna a mediterranean island can offer. the smells are just incredible. scenes from the "deva," easily one of the most beautiful sailboats on the mediterranean. jose miguel antunez, joining us on the crew. he is a legendary basketball player. i don't really know anything about boats, but every detail i saw on the "deva" was beautiful - here, the leather-covered rings on the main mast. posted by the sartorialist at 11:58 am 106 comments newer posts older posts
