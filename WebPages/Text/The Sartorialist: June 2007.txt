- casual but still just enough design - i really like the extra wide cuff on the more casual pants - double-monk strap worn casually - sleeves pushed not rolled - shirt is open two buttons but still very closed at the neck - his look is all thom browne, it is great to see thom worn in a more casual way. - love the smaller aviators posted by the sartorialist at 1:43 am 68 comments effortless, milan posted by the sartorialist at 1:41 am 48 comments monday, june 25, 2007 renata!

i also think the ankle bracelet is a perfect way to f*up a pair of wingtips in a good way this is the same guy that had the bandanna as a pocket square last summer. posted by the sartorialist at 2:11 am 67 comments slim suited p.2, pitti uomo posted by the sartorialist at 2:10 am 27 comments thursday, june 21, 2007 calling mr. onassis....your yacht is ready posted by the sartorialist at 6:00 pm 19 comments long & lovely, pitti uomo posted by the sartorialist at 5:02 pm 26 comments shades of blue, pitti uomo notice another sartorialist wearing dark brown suede loafer posted by the sartorialist at 2:22 am 40 comments slim suited, pitti uomo posted by the sartorialist at 1:24 am 68 comments wednesday, june 20, 2007 guess who i ran into today... her name is albertina marzotto, a journalist, and as you can see she is a woman for all seasons posted by the sartorialist at 2:25 pm 68 comments does it get much better? i took two shots because both are equally important. - the jacket fits great - nice twist with the single breasted peak label. - cuff perfect, drop perfect - americans should not be afraid of linen suits, just bad quality linen suits. it was two in the afternoon by the time i took this shot and he looks no worse for wear. - love the dramatic spread of the shirt collar. perfect pant cuff and perfect slimness to the pant bottom i was wearing brown suede loafers ,very much like his, today and they were so comfortable in the brutal florence heat. next summer i'm buying them in several colors. posted by the sartorialist at 1:35 pm 57 comments tuesday, june 19, 2007 pitti uomo tomorrow tomorrow pitti uomo starts, then on to milan and paris for mens collections. the last two days have been the quiet before the storm so if everything goes well i should have my first post up tomorrow by 4pm and will start posting twice a day (morning & evening) until early july. i read that gianfranco ferre died. he was one of the designers i always wanted to shoot because he had such great personal style. i hope his company is able to keep his name and work alive for a long time to come. posted by the sartorialist at 6:14 pm 13 comments monday, june 18, 2007 hello from roma so i just spent the late afternoon in rome but unfortunately this is the best dressed guy i found. i expected some tourists but rome is all tourists right now. tomorrow i will be in florence for the beginning of pitti uomo , the big menswear trade show, which is like the super bowl of style for men. when i was there in january i got some of my favorite shots during pitti. posted by the sartorialist at 2:15 pm 77 comments sunday, june 17, 2007 coffee with avner so i'm making my way through the marais toward the left bank for the zucca fashion show when i come across this very elegant gentleman, avner gruzow, 83 years young. i ask to take his photo and he agrees on one condition: i sit and have a coffee with him, and tell him about new york (although i knew i would really be the one asking the questions). now, i wanted to go to the zucca show, but how do you pass up a chance to sit and hear a little about the life of a gentleman like this? guess what he did? deep-sea diving! "i was mad for diving," he said, more than once. the years have not been so kind to avner's ablity to communicate and he had trouble remembering certain words, but from what i could make out, he spent some time living in the middle east with the bedouins, he owned a camel, he and his wife own a country house in the south of france but currently live on the left bank. he travels every year to antwerp to visit the area where he grew up. before we said good-bye, he gave me his address and promised that when i return to paris he will show me photos of when he was young in the middle east riding camels and of his diving adventures. his handshake is still strong (stronger than i expected) so my guess is that although he is 83, we will still have quite a few more coffees together, hopefully soon. posted by the sartorialist at 1:37 pm 174 comments saturday, june 16, 2007 on the street.......soho, manhattan love the wide, clear plastic belt. posted by the sartorialist at 9:34 am 60 comments friday, june 15, 2007 on the street.......prince st., soho posted by the sartorialist at 8:51 am 83 comments governor's island roaring '20s dance and hot jazz picnic - 4 posted by the sartorialist at 7:11 am 24 comments thursday, june 14, 2007 on the street.......soho, manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 7:49 am 93 comments on the street.......lafayette st, downtown the patent leather shoes are the perfect finish posted by the sartorialist at 6:44 am 45 comments wednesday, june 13, 2007 is it still "vintage" when it looks this good? posted by the sartorialist at 7:52 am 46 comments newer posts older posts
