the first show that i really liked was junya watanabe. the humor and quirkiness of junya were still evident this season, but they were toned down to a point that made the collection even more desirable. some junya diehards commented afterward that the collection seemed "too commercial." i know they didn't mean it in a good way, but that commercial element made the collection so much more desirable for me. posted by the sartorialist at 3:48 am 96 comments friday, june 25, 2010 on the street...first day of summer, florence posted by the sartorialist at 1:49 pm 114 comments on the street...eva, florence posted by the sartorialist at 1:45 am 224 comments thursday, june 24, 2010 on the street....multi-functional belt, florence posted by the sartorialist at 1:30 am 189 comments wednesday, june 23, 2010 not hiding behind her uniform, florence this young lady was one of the cleaning crew at pitti uomo. she wore the same green uniform as all the other young cleaning ladies but, as you can imagine, she was the only one that really stood out in that crowd. of course i really don't know anything about her but her stylistic choices for her hair, piercings, etc. give us a good place to start. uniforms are, by nature, an attempt to make people conform to a code. i always find it interesting when people are able to play within the set boundaries of a code while still not totally losing their own uniqueness. posted by the sartorialist at 1:13 am 218 comments tuesday, june 22, 2010 on the street....the sartorialist mix, florence i love this mix of adidas shoes and a chic linen jacket worn by a refined gentleman. to wear the expected loafers or espadrilles would, in this case, make his look somehow less interesting. posted by the sartorialist at 1:58 pm 115 comments on the street....giovanna, milano posted by the sartorialist at 1:23 am 155 comments monday, june 21, 2010 at emporio armani, milano posted by the sartorialist at 5:19 pm 95 comments on the street....via della vigna nuova florence posted by the sartorialist at 7:40 am 93 comments sunday, june 20, 2010 top looks....prada, milano this is easily one of the best prada men's collections i've seen in a while. gone are the sometimes over-the-top design details replaced by a very desirable collection based on color and proportion. i think one of the few positives of this economic turbulence has been a shift away from designers trying to seduce us into what they think we need and instead offering clothes that we simply want to wear. i'm showing more images from the runway this season (so far, anyway) because i'm actually seeing lots to love. i'm keeping my fingers crossed that this will continue in paris.
