the sartorialist: i made the sartorialist because i kept seeing guys on the streets of new york or that worked in the fashion industry that i thought were just as fashionable as the models i would see in a gq photo shoot f: what is a sartorialist? s: a gentleman that has developed a style that helps express his personality. f: how did you become one? s: my style icon was giorgio armani growning up. in college i majored in costume construction and i did marketing for valentino. i also owned a showroom that promoted young designers like peter som. f: so what is personal style? s: i like to mix modern and classic items, however i don't like items that are to precious. f: what rules do you follow and which do you break? s: i don't worry about the rules. f: which stores do you like? s: 10 corso como in milano, bergdorf goodman and the apple computer store in new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:37 am 50 comments wednesday, march 29, 2006 on the street...love the mix, soho, new york posted by the sartorialist at 6:49 pm 11 comments meatpacking district, west village, new york this photo was taken at one of the last remaining meatpacking businesses in the meatpacking district. what i like about the photo is that about two hundred yards to the right are the posh boutiques of jeffrey, mcqueen, and mccartney. posted by the sartorialist at 6:45 pm 5 comments on the street...nolita, new york people tell me i have an "open face", what ever that means. maybe it is what i see in this young lady, her relaxed and confident style really seems to highlight what appears to be a very pleasant nature. posted by the sartorialist at 6:26 pm 9 comments duncan quinn i did a preview of duncan qunn's collection for fall 2006. i wanted to take a few shots but he asked if i could wait - he didn't want anyone to knock-off his idea for shirts and ties. usually when someone says that it is rarely an idea that anyone would want anyway but i give duncan credit the idea is pretty cool. overall the collection is a nice step forward, especially in the color palette which is slightly darker and a little more sinister. it will probably give his established customer a reason to update their wardrobe and a reason for new customers to give him a closer look. posted by the sartorialist at 8:49 am 27 comments on the street...soho couple, new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:26 am 17 comments tuesday, march 28, 2006 on the street........19th st., nyc posted by the sartorialist at 6:59 pm 15 comments on the street........39th st. flea market, nyc it is all about the little details - suspenders, leg-warmers worn low, and old school sneakers. posted by the sartorialist at 6:57 pm 24 comments on the street........spring street, nyc i love the hair and the nonchalant way she wears the fur. has there ever been an indie fur designer?

"he was very interested in clothes and had very good taste, very good, i didn’t really realize how good until i got involved in the industry." "he would wear a black cashmere sport jacket, grey flannel pants, white brooks brothers button-down shirt, grey lile socks with garters, black tassel alligator loafers, white handkerchief, club tie - black and white and yellow with a club figure, and a white ground with gold and black tattersall vest – if you can imagine all that, very classy but if i ever saw someone wearing that today i would fall over." "from my background he was clearly the best-dressed man around and he thought fred astaire was the be all and end all. he was a brooks brothers aficionado and a fred astaire fan, so to have brooks brothers and fred astaire as your references, at least initially to look at, they were the right references." posted by the sartorialist at 9:00 am 6 comments on the street..grey jeans so i can't decide what is more adorable, the grey jeans with matching pale grey short boots or the dog peeking out of her black bag. posted by the sartorialist at 8:47 am 13 comments friday, march 24, 2006 on the street..hard-ass pink isn't it funny how something as innocent as miss buttoning a jacket can make a look with so much pink seem so jarring and almost aggressive. i don't think he meant to miss button but i don't think he really cared if he did. bravo! posted by the sartorialist at 5:15 pm 25 comments on the street..back interest from the front the look is nice but all the real fashion detailing is in the back. -the stitched down pleating on the the skirt of the coat -red soled shoes, which can really only be seen from the back posted by the sartorialist at 4:45 pm 8 comments how much cuff? i think we are all pretty much in agreement on how much shirt cuff to show under a jacket but ,as seen on this blog, the amount of jean cuff to show is still widely variable. the amount shown here seems to work for me. posted by the sartorialist at 9:30 am 14 comments on the street... high collar coat posted by the sartorialist at 8:25 am 12 comments home-made beauty - i mean the scarf posted by the sartorialist at 8:20 am 9 comments thursday, march 23, 2006 a coat that frames the face if you don't want to wear a scarf (personally, i can't imagine it) then a coat that frames the face is a great alternative. posted by the sartorialist at 6:15 pm 12 comments on the street... 9th ave. , nyc posted by the sartorialist at 6:02 pm 32 comments jim smiley vintage clothing boutique the first time i went into jim smiley's vintage boutique i started flipping through a rack of beautiful 50's ball gowns. from a nearby desk i heard a polite voice say "please handle the dresses by the hanger". i guess i heard what he said but it didn't really sink in so i kept flipping. a moment later a gentleman (jim smiley) came over and explained that the dresses were very fragile and he would appreciate if i handled the dresses by the hanger. of course i was completely embarrassed and a little put-off but i quickly realized that he wasn't saying this to be pretentious or precious but because he truly respected and cared for his vintage collection. the more i thought about this later the more i realized what a breathe of fresh air jim brings to retail. when was the last time you were in saks and you got the feeling the salesperson really respected the work that went into making the piece and its ultimate historical importance. it sounds weird, but tomorrows fashion history books will be filled with the work of todays prada and armani. though jim's work must be difficult, i think it must also be a bit romantic - hunting through musty old attics for forgotten couture, hearing the stories about the people that owned the items originally and then ( hopefully) selling them to people that will care for them into the future. jim specializes in women's but is growing his mens offering (the cufflinks are a sight). of course not all the items are hands off, so if you are in or plan to visit new york and love high-quality vintage i recommend a visit. posted by the sartorialist at 5:19 am 10 comments wednesday, march 22, 2006 nana boateng i try to make this blog more about style than fashion. nana boateng is a fashion designer with a very well developed style. i cannot really speak about his designs because i haven't seen any but when i met him the other day he just struck me as a guy that loved life and used his clothing as a way of expressing that joy. the clothes he is wearing in the picture above real capture the bold, vibrancy of his personality. nana spent his early years in ghana but grew up all around the world (rome, london, new york) and has such an honesty and refreshing enthusiasms for being in america and beginning his career in fashion. i asked him if his cousin ,oswald boateng, had been a big influence on him growing up. surprisingly, nana said his biggest sartorial influence was his uncle. he remembers his uncle's collection of exotic fragrances, how he had his shoes all made in germany, and when it rained his uncle would wrap his shoes and walk barefoot through the streets of north london. isn't funny the little things we remember from childhood that end up having a huge influence on our lives?
