i shot the story all though fashion week(month) in nyc, milan and paris. the issue is just now hitting the stands and i couldn't be more happy with the results. i ended up getting the cover(!) of this model supplement and a very large number of shots inside. as you can imagine this is a big day for me. ps thanks to everyone that turned out for the met panel discussion yesterday! pss i am in nyc for the next three weeks so get ready for some (hopefully great) new york area street style shots. i might end up in princeton and yale in the next two days (hint) posted by the sartorialist at 8:12 am 116 comments on the street..... blue & black, paris i think introduction of black jeans have pretty much shattered the "rule" that blue and black don't work together. posted by the sartorialist at 8:03 am 52 comments friday, march 28, 2008 on the street..... kanye west, paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:25 am 146 comments the sartorialist at the met this sunday! i am very excited to participate in a panel discussion about fashion and blogging that will be hosted by harold koda and the costume institute and the metropolitan museum of art this sunday. cathy horyn of the new york times and diane pernet will also be part of the panel. the event is free with admission to the museum. i would love to see some..no...all of you at the event, if possible. the event will be held at: the grace rainey rogers auditorium at the museum on sunday, march 30, 2008 from 3:00-4:45pm. posted by the sartorialist at 8:24 am 37 comments on the street..... the grand palais, paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:21 am 88 comments on the street.....the loosely tailored , paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:15 am 60 comments thursday, march 27, 2008 on the steps.....the cut, milan & paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:03 am 128 comments on the steps...pale pink sneakers, paris i love the cut of the jacket and where can i get slim khakis like that?

these are the kind of images and inspiration that i am most proud of posting on the sartorialist posted by the sartorialist at 7:54 am 134 comments on the street....the dramatic match, nyc personally i love everything about this combo of scarf and pinstripe suit but don't let yourself get bogged down in the specifics. this is one of those great abstract inspiration images - "dramatic scarf for a serious suit" i think it shows how a simple ,but well chosen, accessory can liven up a typical 9 to 5 suit. a men's version of "day into evening" the idea would work just as well with contrasty, bold colors and can be just inspiring to both men and women. posted by the sartorialist at 7:44 am 22 comments monday, march 24, 2008 on the street....eve, paris posted by the sartorialist at 10:34 am 73 comments lino on video! the great people over at men.style.com have posted a very good video profiling lino and his store al bazar in milan. you will also see sartorialist regular gianpaolo doing a little english translating for lino. of course tim blanks does another great job capturing the essence of cool that is lino. here is the link lino on men.style.com posted by the sartorialist at 10:16 am 27 comments on the street....pink, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 10:15 am 39 comments on the street....lengths & layers, paris posted by the sartorialist at 10:13 am 31 comments thursday, march 20, 2008 a different day, a different mood for silver eyes, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 6:22 am 134 comments at lanvin. paris posted by the sartorialist at 6:21 am 45 comments wednesday, march 19, 2008 on the street.....early evening, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 7:53 am 237 comments on the street...wes anderson, paris posted by the sartorialist at 7:48 am 96 comments tuesday, march 18, 2008 on the street...in grey & purple, milan posted by the sartorialist at 5:00 pm 77 comments on the street....in blue, paris posted by the sartorialist at 4:57 pm 54 comments on the street....stones, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 10:00 am 50 comments tomorrow exhibit reception in washington dc - open to the public wednesday, march 19th 6:30 - 8:30 p.m. please join us for a special reception with scott schuman (aka the sartorialist), on wednesday, march 19th from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. at adamson gallery. adamson gallery 1515 fourteenth street nw washington dc / 20005 202.232.0707 adamson gallery.com posted by the sartorialist at 9:59 am 17 comments on the street....red & blue, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 9:49 am 25 comments vetiver oil, new delhi my favorite purchase in new delhi was this small bottle of vetiver oil. the gentleman created the entire package for me while i waited. it seemed so old-school cool especially since it only cost $600 rupees which is about $15. later that day i was interviewed by a woman from the times of india. i told her about my purchase which she thought sounded like a lot of money. i guess she decided to take things into her own hands and the next day she quoted me in her paper as saying. " the only thing that i have picked up was an attar bottle ( do you really think i knew it was called an attar?), which was hugely expensive and yet value for the money." basically she quoted me as saying the exact opposite of what i actually said. i confronted her about that the next day and she said "no one will read that anyway" and something to the effect that she made it sound better for me. she didn't seem embarrassed at all by this and never said sorry. the rest of the article is made up of bits and pieces of things i said, taken out of context, and jumbled together as one long quote. most of the time i wouldn't care about something like this but when it is done in one of the biggest papers of dehli and done so outrageously incorrect i get a little miffed. rant over. i still love my new vetiver oil though posted by the sartorialist at 6:09 am 75 comments sunday, march 16, 2008 on the street....silver eyes, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 10:51 pm 114 comments new delhi in black & white and color posted by the sartorialist at 10:50 pm 55 comments on the street....layering, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 12:44 am 45 comments tough way to start saturday morning, new delhi i knew i was going to see things like this but it still doesn't prepare you for when it actually happens. further down the road i saw an even younger girl playing on a 6 inch wide lane divider like it was a balance beam in the middle of a gym. traffic was flying by her on both sides. it leaves me a little numb, more than a little numb - you know it was like that yesterday and it will like that tomorrow. posted by the sartorialist at 12:30 am 126 comments on the street....red & yellow, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 12:27 am 29 comments on the street....purple & orange, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 12:21 am 32 comments friday, march 14, 2008 the shave, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 7:14 pm 46 comments fromthe back window of my taxi, new delhi posted by the sartorialist at 7:12 pm 35 comments thursday, march 13, 2008 world class style from new delhi, india the last thing i want to do on this trip to india is water-down my eye and take a lot of touristy "exotic" pictures. i'm sure i will take some pictures of "great color" blah, blah but i am really happy that so far i have found looks that i would shoot whether i was in nyc or milan or anywhere. this young lady , for example, is as cool as any young lady i have ever met in manhattan. the real genius behind this look is that she is very petite, (maybe) 5' 2" and yet her long dress actually real lengthens her entire frame. the sleevelessness is a huge factor in pulling this off. what i also love is that she is very "put together" and yet extremely sporty. even though the dress was very long and very slim she was running around like she had a track suit on. i rarely use the word effortless because i think it is a messy and mostly unattainable concept but she is about as close to effortless as i have seen in a while. (regarding the bag, because i know it will be commented about, it was more ,for her, about function than form. it was stuffed with paperwork) posted by the sartorialist at 10:39 pm 214 comments on the street....extreme chic, paris posted by the sartorialist at 12:02 am 108 comments at dries van noten posted by the sartorialist at 12:02 am 44 comments wednesday, march 12, 2008 traditionally caped, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 10:04 am 96 comments at marni posted by the sartorialist at 9:45 am 85 comments inspiration in high techno posted by the sartorialist at 9:41 am 22 comments just arrived in india just arrived in new delhi after a very long journey. i hope to have some photos up by tomorrow. i have no idea what i will find so wish me luck. posted by the sartorialist at 9:37 am 45 comments on the street....anna piaggi, milano posted by the sartorialist at 9:34 am 96 comments monday, march 10, 2008 from the sartorialist in march gq don't forget that you can click on an image to see a larger version posted by the sartorialist at 9:58 am 182 comments newer posts older posts
