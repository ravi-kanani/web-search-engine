(read her blog here.) i loved that she's a bigger, curvier girl than most of the other bloggers who you see in the press and tend to represent the genre. the subtle thing she achieves so successfully in these two looks is to complement the sturdy but beautiful shape of her legs with an equally strong shoe. a daintier shoe would be overpowered but these shoes create a beautiful harmony for the lower half of her body. tomorrow i'll post an image of a different young lady i met in paris with a similarly curvy body type but a different method of creating body harmony. update i love a post like this. it creates a real and important conversation. a number of the commenters are upset by the word "curvy." they feel i should have used the word "normal." however, normal is relative. there is a young lady on my team who is 5'0", and another who is 5'9". which would be "normal"? look at the man walking across the street in the first image, and the height of the umbrella in the second - and angelika relative to each. this girl is taller than most, and has the bearing to match. regarding the curves...just because you don't see them does not mean they are not there. is there a minimum degree of curviness to be considered "curvy"? remember, curvy is a body shape, not a weight. to be honest, you can't really see in these photographs most of the curves - chest, stomach, hip - this woman has. i get emails all the time from self-professed curvy girls who want to see representations of their size on the site. what sucks is that when i try to put a photograph up to talk about these issues, the post is hijacked over the political correctness of the words. so help me understand; what is the modern way to speak about size? i'm not married to the word curvy. i'm just trying to describe her in the best way i know how. let's not hide from this issue; i don't want to be afraid to talk about it on my blog. help me describe this young lady without using the word "normal," but in a way that addresses her body size and still references my point about the size of her legs relative to her shoes. last week i did a post of older women every day, and i was proud of that. i am proud to be a blog that is showing women of different sizes. i don't want to lose the potential power of the post by being caught up in wordplay. posted by the sartorialist at 9:20 am 1773 comments sunday, march 27, 2011 on the street.....elisa, milan posted by the sartorialist at 8:10 am 169 comments saturday, march 26, 2011 on the street....before ferre, milan posted by the sartorialist at 8:35 am 172 comments friday, march 25, 2011 on the street.....winter white, florence posted by the sartorialist at 5:02 pm 151 comments on the street..... lee radziwill posted by the sartorialist at 3:29 pm 148 comments on the street.....via bergognone, milan posted by the sartorialist at 7:53 am 94 comments thursday, march 24, 2011 on the street.....piazza degli affari, milan posted by the sartorialist at 5:33 pm 87 comments on the street.....via manzoni, milan this woman was such a vision in her monochrome look. her sole splash of color - a vintage red hermes kelly bag. i tried to communicate with her after the shot but the language difference was too much of a barrier. posted by the sartorialist at 3:28 pm 131 comments on the street.....doyer st., new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:18 am 217 comments wednesday, march 23, 2011 on the street.....piazza oberdan, milan this is one of my favorite shots in a while. i love shooting older people not because i think they are more stylish than any other age, but rather because they have different design references than someone 20 or even 50 years old. for instance, i have never seen a scarf rolled under the chin like this milanese woman has done. so chic and so subtle; i love the waves of fabric cascading over her shoulder. maybe in her younger days all of her girlfriends wore their scarves this way but i've never seen it. this is pure inspiration for me, and inspiration at its most powerful because it doesn't cost money for anyone to recreate that element. posted by the sartorialist at 3:34 pm 200 comments on the street.....via sant'andrea, milan posted by the sartorialist at 8:16 am 164 comments tuesday, march 22, 2011 on the street.....after louis vuitton, paris posted by the sartorialist at 4:37 pm 148 comments joan burstein, browns london posted by the sartorialist at 3:30 pm 233 comments on the street.....via bigli, milan posted by the sartorialist at 7:57 am 102 comments monday, march 21, 2011 costanza pascolato of vogue brasil costanza is a great example of how to mix style and fashion; she has an incredible way of maintaining a consistent personal style while always updating her look with the "it" items of the season. posted by the sartorialist at 3:30 pm 229 comments on the street..... via luca beltrami, milan posted by the sartorialist at 8:44 am 122 comments the sartorialist on twitter i'm now on twitter!!
