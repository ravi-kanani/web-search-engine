"i got this suit in 1990, i was dealing drugs then and one of the girls i sold drugs to threw this suit at me as payment. she would usually steal $20 or $30 bucks and give me that but this time she just threw this suit at me" i can't make this stuff up, i can only hope to remember it until i can write it down. his story was not hard to remember. posted by the sartorialist at 7:40 am 38 comments on the street.... the long of it..., new york this young lady's dress was the most beautiful soft shade of lilac. the color is what caught my eye from about a block away. posted by the sartorialist at 7:37 am 16 comments tuesday, may 30, 2006 on the street.... black summer, new york this is a great example of how to wear black in summer. the fabric weights were spot on but more important was the overall fit - shorter, slimmer and more athletic makes black seem less oppressive in the warm months. posted by the sartorialist at 5:56 pm 14 comments on the street.... daisy of a dress, new york posted by the sartorialist at 5:04 pm 20 comments adam kimmel last week i saw adam kimmel's collection for the first time. he really has hit the trifecta of accounts with colette in paris, dover street market in london and bergdorf's in nyc. if he gets 10 corso como he should just quit because it is all downhill from there. adam's collection is based on real workwear fabrics (the kind the super in my building wears), and he has played those against super luxe fabrics like cashmere or fur. one of adam's smartest moves was knowing that if you are going to use very basic fabrics then production has to be very good, so the manufacturing is done in italy. the outerwear is particularly good - think stylized carhartt (the heavy cotton coat with a squirrel fur lining was very interesting), and the jackets and suiting have a deliberate quirkiness to the cut. i can see why his collection appeals to the more advanced stores. i asked adam about the prices and he said, in a mater-of-fact way, that they were "all over the board". he felt no need to overprice the workwear fabrics just so they fell in line with the cashmere groups. as long as he stays mostly with speciality stores this strategy should work. only when he begins to court the more price structured department stores will he begin to have to deal with the questions of where do they place him. with such a wide price range he could be placed in designer in some stores, or contemporary in others, all depending on which part of the collection they buy into more. he could even have to move by season within an existing account depending on the buyer's presentation, but that would really be a pain for everyone so it will be a challenge for him. with that said, adam has set himself up in a really great position for future growth. he has been able to charm some of the worlds most discriminating stores with a collection of very proletarian fabrics and the most luxe fabrics. going forward he has the whole world of fabric (at all price points) to begin layering into his collection. if he continues to build a reputation as a "quirky fabric guy" he can add everything from denim to super 120's and still have it fit his aesthetic without seeming like he is selling out or stretching to get a lower price point. a designer like thom browne, for instance, has set such a premium on luxe and tailoring that he has given himself very little room for expanding into new fabrications or price points. if he begins to add layers to his collection that are anything less than the original, won't it seem a little like "thom browne lite"? to me adam has really set himself up with an almost perfect business model. sure, anyone could think of it but to actually do it is so, so difficult. this is another one of those dance-of-the-young-designer that i think is so fun to watch. it will be really interesting to see what choices adam makes and if he can turn this early success into a "big time" or at least "long time" business. after all who am i to say that "big time" business should be his goal? maybe mr. alaia has had it right all along. not to put more pressure on you adam but we will be watching. posted by the sartorialist at 7:42 am 20 comments memorial day white dress, nyc i don't know who this is but she just looks famous. posted by the sartorialist at 6:12 am 13 comments monday, may 29, 2006 on the street....happy memorial day, new york posted by the sartorialist at 9:35 am 9 comments old man style....washington square park posted by the sartorialist at 8:44 am 7 comments on the street.....nolita, new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:35 am 22 comments sunday, may 28, 2006 on the street.....midtown, new york notice no crease in the pants posted by the sartorialist at 10:43 am 13 comments on the street.....uptown, new york posted by the sartorialist at 10:21 am 17 comments saturday, may 27, 2006 on the street.....west village, new york posted by the sartorialist at 9:08 am 29 comments on the street.....soho, new york posted by the sartorialist at 9:01 am 23 comments friday, may 26, 2006 on the street.....the navy blazer and layer, new york posted by the sartorialist at 7:34 pm 5 comments on the street.....bleeker street, new york posted by the sartorialist at 6:39 pm 40 comments on the street.....fat bald man always looks great, new york the key to the entire look is the perfect lenght of the suit jacket posted by the sartorialist at 8:26 am 36 comments on the street.....retro in shorts, new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:15 am 41 comments thursday, may 25, 2006 style profile.....simon kneen, vp & creative design director, brooks brothers one of the first posts i did on the sartorialist was about how surprisingly good the brooks brothers fall 2005 advertising campaign was. the store is also looking really good lately - they seem to be finding and good balance between classics and modern fashion. i guess it helps that so many of the classics brooks brothers has introduced through the years are so fashionable right now. i sat down with one of the main men behind the brooks brothers revival simon kneen ,vp & creative design director, to find out a little more about his personal style. best sartorial advice from your dad?

vanity fair cologne, skincare? creed eurofla – been wearing it forever and i always moisturize with anything available after shaving posted by the sartorialist at 8:30 am 18 comments human game - a sartorialist take on sports & style two of new yorks top sartorialists , nick sullivan of esquire and stefano tonchi of new york times have contributed on a new book called human game. the book explores the relationship between sports and style. if you read the recent article about thom browne by sandra nygaard in dnr it is easy to see how dramatically sports can inspire even the highest echelons of fashion. the book will premiere at pitti uomo in florence so as i figure it the book will cost about $9,000 - once i pay for the plane ticket, hotel, and food. i guess i could check b&n.com before i go through all that but that wouldn't be nearly as much fun. posted by the sartorialist at 6:22 am 2 comments wednesday, may 24, 2006 on the street......karim rashid in all white posted by the sartorialist at 6:24 pm 15 comments on the street......brown dress #2, new york so simple, so sexy! posted by the sartorialist at 4:02 pm 38 comments on the street.....madras pants, new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:38 am 24 comments on the street......brown dress #1, new york so fresh, so simple, so sweet. posted by the sartorialist at 7:57 am 17 comments tuesday, may 23, 2006 on the street...blue moleskin jacket, new york this makes the second time in a week that i have seen a blue moleskin jacket look really good. here he has paired it with tonal cords. posted by the sartorialist at 6:23 pm 15 comments on the street...scalloped-edge coat, new york the cold snap we have had in new york the last two days has fed my need for scarves! posted by the sartorialist at 2:19 pm 12 comments on the street....madison ave, new york this look falls under the "not something i would wear " but it is a perfectly executed expression of personal style. so many great elements - the loafers, the club collar, the db jacket w/ only the inside button buttoned. bravo posted by the sartorialist at 7:59 am 14 comments on the street....that hair, that smile, new york ok, i have come to realize that women with great hair usually have a great smile. is it the hair that is giving them such a joyful smile? here is a hint to the gentleman - try giving your wife/girlfriend a gift certificate to a top notch hair salon for her next birthday/anniversary/getting-out-of-the-doghouse gift and see if you don't end up with the biggest smile by the next day. posted by the sartorialist at 6:45 am 43 comments monday, may 22, 2006 on the street.....for hedi, new york posted by the sartorialist at 5:17 pm 28 comments on the street.....spring street, new york posted by the sartorialist at 5:00 pm 20 comments on the street.....seersucker sunday, new york could there be a better example of the two ways to wear a seersucker suit than these two gentleman? i love the shoes on both guys - i would probably wear jack purcells but thats just me. actually, the gentleman in the top photo is the creative director for j.press, the gentleman in the lower photo is wearing a j. press seersucker suit and probably has been wearing them since before mark was born. posted by the sartorialist at 7:15 am 22 comments sunday, may 21, 2006 on the street.....westside, new york so what would we call this style? it is not american or italian or even modern jil sander or dior-ish, i'm leaning towards a retro french late 50's thing - i think it is the shape of the coat that is giving me that vibe posted by the sartorialist at 4:14 pm 38 comments saturday, may 20, 2006 on the street.....headphones, new york both the pants and jacket are moleskin - i love that fabric for clothing. you really have to make sure the fit is just perfect because it is not very forgiving and the stiffness can look very bad on a shorter man but if tailored correctly it can look great - like in this example (notice it is a tall guy) i also love that i shot him in his old=school headphones right outside the brand new apple store on fifth ave. posted by the sartorialist at 6:46 am 13 comments on the street.....3/4 sleeve princess, new york i'm a complete sucker for a 3/4 sleeve. whether it is done as "straight-up princess" like this or even when is is vintage and layered over a hoodie. posted by the sartorialist at 6:00 am 17 comments friday, may 19, 2006 style cue - part 2 "scusi" i saw the young guy i posted earlier and this fine young gentleman only a few blocks apart the other day. they both share the very italian style of wearing the back of the tie slightly longer than the front. so italian ,in fact, that i find it easier when approaching these guys to say "scusi" first, in my very limited but decent italian accent. i find that this gives the subtle clue that i completely recognize they are italian by their style alone - it has worked everytime so far. the down side is that they start speaking to me in italian and i have to quickly explain that "scusi" is one of the few italian words i know. this gentleman happens to be an executive at saint andrews. besides the tie, i also wanted to point out that he is wearing a buttondown shirt with his suit. i see buttondowns on italians much more than americans even though the buttondown is so essentially american. thom browne has done a great job working the buttondown back into our suited wardrobe but i would love to see versions done by some other houses like ,maybe, hickey. fred astaire wore a lot of buttondowns, i would love to see that look modernized. posted by the sartorialist at 5:00 pm 27 comments on the street.....prince street, new york posted by the sartorialist at 4:11 pm 31 comments style cue when i approach someone to shoot ,especially if they don't seem like new yorkers, i often look for some type of style cue that may help break the ice. can anyone tell the style cue with this gentleman and how that might help me approach him?
