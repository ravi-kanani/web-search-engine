all the best, alejandro posted by the sartorialist at 9:06 am 177 comments friday, may 21, 2010 on the street....white heat, florence posted by the sartorialist at 1:00 pm 130 comments men of moscow i had to save these shots from last trip to moscow until they appeared in my gq page. the thing that impressed me about men's style in moscow is that it's really unlike that of any european city. this young moscow generation is really pushing againist the city's image of blinged-out versace-ism and is looking to make a new statement for themselves. the haircuts are different in moscow too, i mean, when was the last time you saw a guy wearing an updated beatles shag that actually looked pretty cool? i think this push against bling has most affected the young designers in moscow. it seems that fleece has replaced cashmere as the primary fabric of choice. i saw it worn colorblocked (as above) and mixed with leather (below). with fleece as a core fashion fabric, young designers can afford to take more chances with design, color, and assortment. it was great to see the high-end fashion boutiques in moscow hanging collections of small, local designers next to the big international brands. it was also funny/cringy to see amercian west done as a fashion statement in a super cool shop like kuznetsky most 20. i'm betting the moscow retail scene will become one of the best and most daring over the next ten years. rents are still low, the people are hungry for fashion and there is a deep history of great artistic expression in the russian people. now if they can just get a few more cool hotels and restuarants. posted by the sartorialist at 8:34 am 82 comments wednesday, may 19, 2010 degand, brussels easily one of the best men's shops i have been to in a long time. the hats, the canes, the shoes, the pajamas, this is a shop where a man goes to become a gentleman. housed in a 5 floor 1911 townhouse on the edge of the main shopping district in brussels, this is not a shop that a tourist would easily fall into, but it's worth the hunt for any true sartorialist. brioni and kiton are the shop's main clothing labels, but i would go for their special edit of edward green shoes. in fact, they will be opening an entire separate shoe shop in september if everything goes according to plan. one of the elements of degand's selection that i was most surprised by was the extent of the formalwear that they offer. i think that says a lot about how the residents of brussels have retained a sense of old world elegance and respect for certain public events like weddings, operas and funerals. thanks to my good friend gianpaolo of al bazar for tipping me off about this great shop. degand is located at 415 avenue louise, brussels posted by the sartorialist at 6:09 pm 134 comments tuesday, may 18, 2010 on the street....rue de la cle, brussels a very good friend of mine challenged me last week because i didn't post on friday. he cautioned me that i had trained the readers to check the blog 3 times a day based on my posting over the last few months. i tried to explain that the human element of the this blog, i'm not a big corporate magazine, is always the at the core of each post. if i have a lot of images to post i will, but if i don't have an image i won't post something just to keep an audience happy. that is very much the case with this image. i knew i didn't have any images in reserve for today but instead of going for the easy shot in a city i didn't know, i took a chance and just let myself get lost. sometimes getting lost and taking chance can result in finding a completely surprising and a very rewarding shot like this. i won't get into the religious and political issues of this woman because the romantic in me wishes that we all could just get along. i hope we can discuss her style and self-expression for the its genuine nature and celebrate the differences that keep this human family so interesting. posted by the sartorialist at 6:00 pm 310 comments monday, may 17, 2010 on the street....the dancer, berlin posted by the sartorialist at 3:00 pm 163 comments asking for a little help! i've had this razor for years. i love it. i love the weight of it, the look of it, and the fact that i've been able to hold onto it for so long. however, i haven't been able to use it for years because they just don't make blades for that type of head anymore. so i need a little help. where can i get the head of this razor reworked to fit the new standard blades? and for the ladies, a great father's day gift might be a classic, reworked razor. all of us guys need some type of razor and today's options are usually less than chic. posted by the sartorialist at 7:54 am 183 comments sunday, may 16, 2010 gotta be prada, vintage photo this is a picture of my grandmother taken in 1956 on her honeymoon in cairns. i think the whole shot is fantastic, the old snorkel, bathers and flippers - it simply captures her personality; colourful and slightly wild. it was taken on what would be the first of many exotic trips in which my grandfather would force my grandmother to experience all there was to experience. what attracted me firstly to the photo was the amazing bikini which just seems so stylish and secondly the fact that my grandparents, now 83, are still going on similar trips -sailing down the dalmatian coast of croatia this year! i hope you like the picture as much as i do. -iona posted by the sartorialist at 12:05 pm 127 comments brussels monday! monday i will be in brussels!! below is the information for the event. monday 17th may book signing chic outlet village maasmechelen village, belgium 4pm till 6pm it's my first time there so i am very excited. any suggestions on what i shouldn't miss?

"biarritz_1936" they lived normally in reims, north-east from france. this photo was taken just before the war in 1936 in biarritz. they are on their honeymoon. i like this photo a lot because they just feel happy and they look incredibly elegant and stylish even if they are at the sea... it would never happen nowdays ! my grand-father was half english and until his death very elegant, a real gentlman. i also like the contrast of the perfect hair for my grand-father and the wind blowing through the hair of my grand-mother. i could not resist sending you a photo of them both in bandol on the same vacation because i find them so beautiful even though they are just wearing the minimum: a swimsuit. the photo reminds me a little bit of man ray photo. best regards, alexandra posted by the sartorialist at 7:50 am 69 comments thursday, may 13, 2010 garance's birthday at wolgan valley resort and spa recently, when we were in australia we spent garance's birthday at a really great resort. the rooms, the spa, and the food were all wonderful, but all that interested me was mountain biking around the resort's grounds. when we told our australian friends we were gong to the "outback" for the weekend, they laughed when we told them that it was wolgan valley and said that the real outback was another hour away. after a few more incidents like this we stopped calling it the "outback" and started calling it the "halfback." (click on image to enlarge photo) this is chris, garance's assistant. everywhere we turned was another photo-op. with the landscapes, animals, and food, this place truly made me fall in love wth the idea of photography outside of the big city. i took this picture while riding my bike very fast, too fast in retrospect, on a bumpy dirt rode. i'm surprised that i got even one shot in focus. self-portrait of my shadow at sunset. the great/scary thing about these little grass-covered paths is that your bicycle moves so quietly that you can sneak up on a group of kangaroos before they even notice you. i wasn't particularly interested in surprising any kangaroos, so we spent a lot of time singing very loudly while we rode. human league anyone? i know that i'm a total city kid and i'm sure that some of you have wrestled bears and hunted dinosaurs, but for me, being this close to wild animals while on a mountain bike was pretty cool. my primary reading material while flying to berlin was a book on shooting better landscapes. hopefully i will get a chance to shoot a few more soon. maybe the amish countryside could be cool? posted by the sartorialist at 6:11 pm 141 comments wednesday, may 12, 2010 on the street....claude, berlin i'm in berlin right now shooting an ad campaign. yesterday i met claude, her name is claudia but she hates that name. as you can see, claude is a beautiful example of a young lady that knows how to play up her best assets. we cast her because she has the figure of a real, everyday girl: she stands about 5'1" and she is very curvy. you can't really appreciate her curves because of her coat, but they're there. it has actually been a little difficult to find samples that fit her correctly but really, who could get past her hair, lips and those legs? she knows that these are her best featues and works with us to find looks that suit her best. to me, this is such a great reminder to stop obsessing about my own personal imperfections and start highlighting the little gifts. tomorrow i'm cutting the sleeves off all of my guy rover shirts and showing off the guns!
