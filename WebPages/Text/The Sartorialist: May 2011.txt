i know a lot of girls would throw on a big cotton dress like this and call it done...almost a "fashion day-off." alessandra, however, adds a dramatic necklace and a thoughtfully executed hairstyle and it elevates the entire look. the hair in this look is so important. i think the reason the girls i saw in savannah looked so great, even as casually dressed college kids, was because they all seemed to have great hairstyles. i think this shot is a great example of clothes as a plain canvas for the fashion in the rest of the look...as roasted chicken is to a complicated french sauce. on this look, let the summer games begin!! posted by the sartorialist at 8:26 am 130 comments monday, may 23, 2011 on the street.... prinsengracht, amsterdam posted by the sartorialist at 4:32 pm 224 comments my cleverley cordovan shoes in progress my personal last sitting on top of the fitting sketch. george from cleverley sent me these snapshots of my cordovan shoes in progress. i'm both excited and nervous about having them finished. the design process is a lot like making a photograph - technically, it's not that difficult - however, does the finished image/product convey what you originally envisioned? i want these shoes to look great with grey flannels but also dark navy denim. the more i think about it, the success will lie in the sole of the shoe (wow, that's kind of a play on words). if the sole is too thin and refined it will miss the ruggedness that is a hallmark of cordovan. if the sole is too thick and clunky (which is currently the trend) it will miss the whole reason for creating my own vision. even though the process is more than halfway done, it seems the most tricky decisions are yet to be made. i'll keep you posted. the cordovan leather specially ordered for this pair of shoes. i was nervous about finding the perfect color, but we were able to nail it. posted by the sartorialist at 3:30 pm 50 comments on the street.....eva, milan posted by the sartorialist at 10:02 am 180 comments sunday, may 22, 2011 vintage photos this is a photo of my maternal grandparents, taken while they were dating in the late 1940's. -beca posted by the sartorialist at 11:49 am 184 comments saturday, may 21, 2011 vintage photos - may posted by the sartorialist at 4:30 pm 52 comments on the street....runstraat, amsterdam posted by the sartorialist at 9:16 am 70 comments thursday, may 19, 2011 on the street.....danish navy, copenhagen posted by the sartorialist at 4:34 pm 114 comments young ladies shot on their bike from my bike, amsterdam, milan & copenhagen amsterdam milan copenhagen posted by the sartorialist at 7:37 am 238 comments wednesday, may 18, 2011 on the street.... runstraat, amsterdam posted by the sartorialist at 9:39 am 176 comments tuesday, may 17, 2011 on the street.... luca r., milan posted by the sartorialist at 4:30 pm 136 comments on the street.... red light vintage, amsterdam posted by the sartorialist at 11:51 am 84 comments monday, may 16, 2011 on the street.... via manzoni, milan posted by the sartorialist at 5:04 pm 214 comments on the street.... prinsengracht, amsterdam it was a little crowded shooting in amsterdam yesterday. apparently, the local football club won a big championship game and everyone was out to celebrate. posted by the sartorialist at 5:25 am 305 comments sunday, may 15, 2011 vintage photos i could not resist sending you this piece of "old fashion photography". this photo was taken by my grandfather in new york, probably in 1968. he spent most of his life travelling around the world, and sparked my own passion for photography. - giulia posted by the sartorialist at 4:03 pm 86 comments friday, may 13, 2011 vintage photos my father is a gentleman, brought up in an era when one dressed for occasion and where clothes were cared for and tended. this photo was taken about 1954 when he was posted to japan in order to assist with the return of australian troops from korea. my mother, not wanting to miss out on the adventure, jumped on a freighter and managed to get herself to hiru where they found a traditional japanese house and embraced the experience together. i should add that my parents were extremely tall for their generation, my father at 6'2" and my mother 5' 10" so they would have created a stir within the local community in which they lived so perhaps he felt he could be bold in a foreign land. - alison posted by the sartorialist at 9:38 am 85 comments thursday, may 12, 2011 on the street....via del carmine, milan posted by the sartorialist at 9:40 pm 243 comments wednesday, may 11, 2011 on the street....state st., savannah posted by the sartorialist at 9:07 am 137 comments tuesday, may 10, 2011 amsterdam! thank you so much for the info about copenhagen - i didn't realize it would be so quiet there over the weekend! so, i've taken your advice. i will be in copenhagen on the 16th and 17th. that weekend, i will instead go to amsterdam. where can i find really cool cultural events there? the equivalent of a bullfight in madrid; something that resonates as a tradition. something that is "amsterdam." posted by the sartorialist at 6:14 pm 271 comments on the street....tompkins square park, new york i saw this gentleman playing basketball yesterday at tompkins square park. the mix of the black tights, the long (almost skirtlike) shorts, the wave cap pulled tight over a low bun at the base of his neck, the tight white tank, had me thinking more of a givenchy men's collection than the knicks. i mean really, just change his tank to a white poplin shirt and it could be a rick owens or raf simons look. i've always said that sports is at the forefront of what "real men" (read: macho men) would wear. there's a very simple reason...men will do or wear anything to win a game. they will shave off all their body hair, they will wear skintight lycra bodysuits, they will wear shorts that look like skirts if they think it will help them win or fit in with the team. i know a lot of young designers and design students look at the site. a great self-challenge is to step outside of the fashion world and go to a basketball game or football game without any preconceived notions and just see it for the actual design elements. the advanced sport-specific fabrics, the color themes of team jerseys, the proportions, the graphics; they all are fertile material for modern design inspiration. i remember back in the eighties, football players like running back greg pruitt of the browns wore tear-away jerseys. they would go through several jerseys a game. just imagine how goth warrior those guys looked in there heavily padded uniforms with jerseys covered in slashes, tears, and gaping holes. just think how those uniforms helped reinforce the imagery of alpha masculinity that they wanted to portray. as i was working of this photo it reminded me of a shot i took in sodermalm, stockholm a few years ago. this shot is evidence of the very direct influnce sports can have on even the most advanced street/runway looks. august 2007 posted by the sartorialist at 8:12 am 145 comments monday, may 09, 2011 on the street....mott st., new york posted by the sartorialist at 4:30 pm 96 comments copenhagen! hi guys, thanks so much for all the great info about philly and boston. between my schedule and the weather a day hasn't worked out yet, but it's very high on my priority list. in the meantime, i have plans to visit copenhagen next week. i think i'll be there the 14th and 15th. where should i go?
