"abercrombie & fitch will make its european debut with a bang on savile row. industry sources here say the american retailer will move into the jil sander flagship at 7 burlington gardens, on the corner of savile row." maybe it is my generation but i relate everything to tv. doesn't this sound like a setup for a tv sitcom? is john cleese really that busy, couldn't he do a show as the stuff but down-on-his-luck tailor that is forced to rent a room to the slacker american manager of the new abercrombie played by skeet ullrich. i'd watch. maybe tara reid is the ditzy daughter of cleese that can't stop drooling over skeet. ok, i'm calling nbc right now, they need to make up for couples and the office (american version) and this is their chance. posted by the sartorialist at 5:51 pm 21 comments window shopping.......bergdorf goodman 11/19 posted by the sartorialist at 10:37 am 7 comments on the street.... 58th street, midtown posted by the sartorialist at 12:10 am 16 comments on the street.... hickey freeman executive, midtown posted by the sartorialist at 12:03 am 9 comments tuesday, november 29, 2005 on the street....central park, manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 7:10 am 4 comments window shopping.......bergdorf goodman 11/19 posted by the sartorialist at 7:05 am 6 comments flea market find.....the portrait i love finding these old paintings at flea markets: faded, holes, chipped paint, all the better. posted by the sartorialist at 7:00 am 6 comments monday, november 28, 2005 the sartorialiste posted by the sartorialist at 9:27 am 8 comments sunday, november 27, 2005 the sartorialist visits julians in chapel hill, nc i stopped by julians in chapel hill, north carolina while traveling for thanksgiving. great old store with a very long and celebrated history. i was a little underwhelmed by the selection, maybe i was expecting too much. i guess i was looking for preppy or trad to out do ralph but ralph's rugby store opened across the street and has more energy, color and variety. it is frustrating when a relative newcomer like ralph (julian's has been open 65 years) can out prep an original. of course the sales staff were true southern gentlemen. posted by the sartorialist at 9:45 pm 12 comments the young tailor posted by the sartorialist at 8:17 am 9 comments saturday, november 26, 2005 the new skate style....less formal than before posted by the sartorialist at 7:17 am 7 comments sunday morning....brooklyn, new york posted by the sartorialist at 6:16 am 4 comments friday, november 25, 2005 slim coat if you can posted by the sartorialist at 9:42 am 6 comments window shopping.......bergdorf goodman posted by the sartorialist at 8:30 am 4 comments hint ,my favorite online fashion website, has the best fashion-centric links page on the internet. designers, magazines, retailers and miscellaneous sites that every sartorialist should have at their finger tips. posted by the sartorialist at 8:00 am 1 comments thursday, november 24, 2005 alone in a crowd i hope everyone that makes it home for thanksgiving realizies just how lucky they are. have a great day. labels: my favorites, scenes of new york posted by the sartorialist at 9:44 am 34 comments wednesday, november 23, 2005 on the street....farmer's market, union square posted by the sartorialist at 9:32 pm 11 comments window shopping.......luigi borrelli shoes posted by the sartorialist at 11:00 am 6 comments the coolest hoodie i've ever seen posted by the sartorialist at 1:20 am 13 comments window shopping.......calvin klein posted by the sartorialist at 1:15 am 0 comments why are fashion designers afraid of their own salespeople. why is every salesperson in jil sander, gucci, prada, fendi, and louis vuitton dressed almost exactly alike? black suit, white shirt, black or somber tie. while i was shopping in these stores on fifth avenue today, i could not tell the difference between the salespeople and the security guards. when you consider that these designer brands represent the heights of fashion self-expression, why don't they let their sales staff join in on the fun ? i base my choice of which salesperson's i work with on their personal style (which is difficult to say the least when they are all dress in a uniform). david anicich from borrelli is a perfect example, on first seeing him i immediately knew he could help make me look better. if you ask management, they would say the "uniform" allows the salespeople to wear the clothes without spending a ton of money on designer clothing. nice try. most of the salespeople work because they love the clothes. basically management is afraid their own salespeople just don't get it. granted ,in alot of cases they are right; it is very tough to find great salespeople with equally great personal style to work retail, but some stores have learned how to successfully exploit their staff as walking, talking mannequins and they are reaping the rewards. who gets it? ralph lauren abercrombie & fitch bergdorf goodman not only do these companies have great ads and store displays, but by dressing the staff in a variety of the clothes, customers can better imagine how real people might look in the clothes. not that the hotties at abercrombie are real people but you get the idea. posted by the sartorialist at 1:10 am 13 comments window shopping.......santoni posted by the sartorialist at 12:01 am 4 comments tuesday, november 22, 2005 truth is stranger,no..more fantastic, than fiction the first official nominee for sartorialist of the year. labels: my favorites posted by the sartorialist at 1:05 am 32 comments the mannequins time forgot...orchard street, new york labels: scenes of new york posted by the sartorialist at 1:02 am 7 comments monday, november 21, 2005 window shopping.......etro posted by the sartorialist at 11:18 pm 1 comments window shopping.......burberry posted by the sartorialist at 10:49 pm 1 comments sunday, november 20, 2005 a sartorialist at heart posted by the sartorialist at 9:40 pm 11 comments on the street....flea market, sixth ave, posted by the sartorialist at 9:36 pm 2 comments window shopping.......barneys new york berluti shoes at barneys new york. posted by the sartorialist at 6:29 pm 1 comments the new skate style....tompkins square park, les a little slim, a little color, a little nerdy, a lot of attitude. labels: scenes of new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:37 am 4 comments window shopping.......polo ralph lauren posted by the sartorialist at 1:55 am 2 comments what's mory wearing today?

will this make a difference at bergdorf? posted by the sartorialist at 8:02 am 4 comments thursday, november 17, 2005 coffee with gabor halmos of vass shoes telling me that vass shoes are exquisitely well made is like telling me that natalie portman went to harvard because she is really smart. that's great, and i'm sure that helps in some way, but i just can't get past how beautiful they both are. the great thing about meeting with gabor halmos to preview the vass collection is that he doesn't have an office in the city. instead we have to meet at incredibly chic places like pastis to discuss toe boxes, hidden welts, and the complicated matter of harvesting cordovan from a horse's ass. almost every waitress at pastis came over to our table to advise us on which styles they thought would be good for me. is it true that the way to a woman's heart is through your feet? all kidding aside, it is very interesting to listen to gabor discuss the challenges of growing a luxury shoe business (on the level of lobb or a lattanzi) in the us. i was surprised gabor said that the perception of a luxury product "made in hungary" was the biggest obstacles for some retailers. when you hold the shoe it is so easy to feel and see the quality. unfortunately i'm shallow, so what makes the vass shoes on par, if not surpass, lobb and especially berluti is the design. of course my favorite store, bergdorf goodman spotted the potential of vass and secured exclusive rights for new york city. vass can also be ordered through another favorite store of mine, louis boston luckily, as gabor spreads the gospel of vass to stores around the u.s., one of the best tools available to him is the incredible book written by laszlo vass called handmade shoes for men. it reminds me of the borrelli booklet on how their shirts are made. each page of the vass book makes you appreciate the craft of shoe making, but it also make you want the shoes more. posted by the sartorialist at 7:05 am 4 comments tuesday, november 15, 2005 window shopping.......luigi borrelli posted by the sartorialist at 9:00 pm 1 comments style profile...duckie brown i love it when i meet a designer (or in this case, two) and they are as funny, relaxed and as full of personality as the clothes they design. steven (left) and daniel's (right) views on personal style are as quirky as the duckie brown collection they design. best sartorial advice from your dad?
