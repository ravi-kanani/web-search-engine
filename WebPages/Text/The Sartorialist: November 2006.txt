i imagined he was an artist stopping by his madison ave. art dealers gallery to discuss an overdue masterpiece or a modern day ernest hemingway. (wow, i just googled hemingway and found a fantastic photo of him that i will post tomorrow!) later that day i asked someone i thought might know who he was and he said "that's the guy that heads ralph lauren's vintage department." apparently this gentlemen travels the world buying all the great vintage items (frames,books,fixtures etc) that you find decorating ralph's stores. (pardon me if i don't have the job description perfectly correct) to me, that is almost as romantic a job as being a famous artist. labels: men new york posted by the sartorialist at 7:54 am 90 comments on the street.... comme des garçons, chelsea i shot this young lady a few days after the "modern hemingway" shot above - i thought she would make such a perfect companion to his look and maybe it could illustrate how a young lady might interpret that look. i love the plaid shirt working back to the zip sweater and the overall slouchiness. i think this might be the first time i have been jealous of a girls outfit (not that there is anything wrong with that) posted by the sartorialist at 7:35 am 48 comments absolut nomination i am proud to announce that the sartorialist has been nominated for the absolut 100 (in the blog section) apparently absolut is creating a top 100 list covering all types of fields like designers, chef, bar or band etc the other blogs are big-time like the huffington post or engadget or boing boing - i am just happy to be included (but i really want to win!!) if you want to vote for the sartorialist just click the link below (but do it quick because voting ends soon) absolut 100 posted by the sartorialist at 5:50 am 63 comments sunday, november 26, 2006 on the street.....mixed proportion, manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 10:02 am 47 comments best of season.....girl in milan posted by the sartorialist at 9:59 am 52 comments saturday, november 25, 2006 on the street.....just off madison ave. , manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 10:23 am 50 comments best of season.....emmanuelle alt of paris vogue posted by the sartorialist at 10:00 am 38 comments friday, november 24, 2006 barbour coats - just about the best value in menswear barbour coats are just about the best value in menswear. the quilted jacket above is the liddesdale model and sells in the us for about $145. i love mine, it is lightweight and keeps me perfectly warm and works well with both business or casual wear. i also have the bedale waxed jacket in original green. i bought mine almost 10 years ago and wore it until it was literally in shreds. i simply took it to the barbour store in new york and they sent it to be repaired. unfortunately, now it looks just like new - crap! i should have had them only fix half of the rips. now it will take me another 5 years to get it back into bad shape! posted by the sartorialist at 4:50 pm 42 comments on the street.....madison ave, manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 8:44 am 71 comments on the street.....66th st., manhattan i love how well the subtle textures of her dress, tights and socks all work together. her look could almost be called minimalist but there is actually so much going on here - jil would be proud. posted by the sartorialist at 8:07 am 40 comments thursday, november 23, 2006 vintage bike man is back!!

posted by the sartorialist at 9:21 am 49 comments on the street......the details, nolita griege, black, brown - it is often difficult to get those colors to work together well but this young lady does a great job vintage ferragamo shoes. she said the main attraction to the shoes was that they were brown/black spectators. i love the scarf detail - it is two scarves tied together making one large circle scarf the secret to her scarf detail is that she buys several of the $5 street pashmina scarves. i guess when they are $5 you can affor to buy in bulk. posted by the sartorialist at 9:05 am 77 comments sunday, november 19, 2006 on the weekend......richard chai shopping with friends, nolita posted by the sartorialist at 10:01 am 47 comments on the street......the student, chelsea posted by the sartorialist at 9:13 am 18 comments saturday, november 18, 2006 one year ago i took this photo a year ago (the weekend before thanksgiving) and it is one of my all time favorites. posted by the sartorialist at 9:41 am 28 comments on the street......milan posted by the sartorialist at 8:46 am 25 comments newer posts older posts
