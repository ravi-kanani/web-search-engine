i was wondering if anyone got the shot - the hand on the right is me catching one of the girls as she fell. the young lady in this photo had already fallen three times before she reached me and fell again about five steps past me. i have never seen a more terrified girl on the runway - it was very difficult to watch. finally she took the shoes off and walked in bare feet the rest of the way. a lot of people had thought that the reason the girls kept falling was because the heels were too high. actually, it was the little cotton socks that were inside the shoes. the girls couldn't keep their heels in the shoes correctly. if you think lara stone looks stern in her everyday life, she looked five times more serious trying to make it around the maze/catwalk in those shoes. did miuccia ever explain her side of why the girls kept slipping? maybe the samples were late and they were not able to check them correctly? posted by the sartorialist at 8:24 am 100 comments wednesday, november 19, 2008 on the street....student milanese, milan posted by the sartorialist at 5:10 pm 83 comments on the street....student parisian, paris posted by the sartorialist at 5:09 pm 53 comments signs of life, paris i was chit-chatting with susan after i took this picture and mentioned that i thought her hair was sooo beautiful - her best feature. she said thanks and added that she had lost her hair once because of cancer. she now purposely keeps it long because she feels it is such a gift to have it back and, for her, a sign of life. posted by the sartorialist at 9:44 am 105 comments the new sprezzatura? it seems the italians are dying to find new agnelli-isms. apparently leaving the strap of your monkstrap shoes undone is all the rage. usually i only see it done with double monkstraps, but this brave italian was throwing caution (and safety) to the wind and had the straps on both shoes undone. i'm not condoning, just reporting. posted by the sartorialist at 9:26 am 55 comments what i love about carine i love that carine is always happy to stop and talk or have her picture taken with her fans. carine shows a genuine interest - carine asked this young lady where she was from. the girl walked away just beaming. posted by the sartorialist at 7:54 am 54 comments tuesday, november 18, 2008 gq preview - boots & suits, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 9:43 am 108 comments on the street....shirt & skirt, paris posted by the sartorialist at 9:18 am 63 comments on the street....astrid, rio posted by the sartorialist at 9:03 am 66 comments monday, november 17, 2008 the gentlelady & gentleman biker, paris & milan posted by the sartorialist at 9:47 am 79 comments on the street....aya #1, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 9:44 am 51 comments on the street....near le marais, paris posted by the sartorialist at 9:41 am 75 comments on the street....elegance, rio posted by the sartorialist at 9:31 am 48 comments friday, november 14, 2008 on the street....blue eyes, rio posted by the sartorialist at 10:21 am 85 comments cement barbells, rio posted by the sartorialist at 9:43 am 24 comments on the street....color, rio posted by the sartorialist at 8:45 am 43 comments thursday, november 13, 2008 beach party for michael roberts' new book "saved", rio posted by the sartorialist at 4:17 pm 82 comments newer posts older posts
