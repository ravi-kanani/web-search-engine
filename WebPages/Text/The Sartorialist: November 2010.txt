run by gianluca bocache (above) and andrea luparelli, the shop is super chic and specializes in custom suits and shoes. i hate to admit it but i always judge a shop by the owners and these guys are cool. i love a peak lapel suit, however the question is always one or two-button. i always go peak with one-button but i'm swayed by gianluca's two-button swagger. unfortuneately my shooting schedule in rome was so tight (made worse by the never ending rain) i wasn't able to shoot the shop but it will give me a reason to return to rome asap. if you find yourself in the eternal city here is their shop info. sartoria ripense: via di ripetta, 38 00186 roma +39 06 323 3727 info@sartoriaripense.com sartoria ripense posted by the sartorialist at 4:03 pm 96 comments clic gallery & bookstore, new york clic gallery & bookstore down on centre street is really fantastic. i hardly ever get out of there without finding a book i cannot live without. recently i bought a great book, space project by vincent fournier. i have no idea what the book is about but i love the photographs!

**location of casting has been moved. please see address below as a lot of you know, last summer i shot the campaign for ovs in milan. well it was a big hit and ovs have asked me to shoot their upcoming summer 2011 campaign in rome. as a great way to update the campaign and be more reflective of what i do, i have conviced ovs to let me cast a portion of the campaign from you, my audience. so here's the deal... i want casting that looks like my blog - men and women, all ages, all races, all sizes... with one commonality, great style and charisma. the casting will be held november 7th 10am - 2pm l'hotel cicerone via cicerone 55 roma the room's name - sala cesi-valadier. the people should be from rome or the surrounding areas. you must be available for the shoot dates november 8th - 11th the people selected could be used as main subjects or as extras. secretly, i'm really excited to be able to meet some cool sartorialists whilst in the eternal city and have a chance to celebrate some of my audience in an italian national ad campaign. s. posted by the sartorialist at 8:00 am 111 comments thursday, november 04, 2010 on the street....glove hat, paris posted by the sartorialist at 4:30 pm 188 comments on the street....university place, new york posted by the sartorialist at 8:24 am 171 comments wednesday, november 03, 2010 on the street....bowery, new york posted by the sartorialist at 4:35 pm 117 comments on the street....shoeshine, buenos aires i watched this typical "street shoeshine" scene from my car while we drove to an appointment in buenos aires. nothing particularly special...until!...the shine administrator wrapped a plastic cuff around the left sock of the client to protect the client's sock from the shoe polish. so thoughtful! this might be common practice in some communities but i, personally, have never seen that maneuver. recently there has been a big, bordering on huge, trend towards old school barber shops opening in new york city. i would love to see an equal re-emergence of shoe shine stands. maybe they should be inside the barber shops (hint, hint). i mean, i'm doing nothing but looking at old magazines while i wait for my turn anyway, why not get a shine!
