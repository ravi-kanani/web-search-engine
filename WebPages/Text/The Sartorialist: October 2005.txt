think about it, with tom ford gone from gucci and prada now predicting $1.83 billion in sales by 2010, didn't bertelli come out the big winner? can't you imagine a "ripped from the headlines" l&o with glen close as a fatal attractionish jil sander going murderess on a dennis hopper's patrizio bertelli. posted by the sartorialist at 9:01 am 7 comments sunday, october 30, 2005 chess king....greenwich village, new york the village chess shop is one of those only in new york places. opened in 1972, its history is written on the faces of its long-time members and on the yellowing newspaper articles that decorate its walls. the village chess shop is one of those places that is a world unto itself. when a regular enters, they are greeted like norm at cheers. pick-up games are played day and night (until midnight!), every day of the week. i mean really, where but new york would you to able to support an all-night chess den, let alone two. the chess forum opened six years ago across the street and runs a similar schedule, if only slightly less steeped in history. labels: scenes of new york posted by the sartorialist at 2:53 pm 6 comments friday, october 28, 2005 the coolest cat in williamsburg labels: my favorites, scenes of new york posted by the sartorialist at 10:55 pm 23 comments savile row tailor thomas mahon in new york thomas mahon ,savile row tailor and author of the blog english cut, was in new york recently taking orders from his growing american clientele. the sartorialist asked thomas a few questions before the beer started flowing. how is your american customer different from your english or french customer? the americans appreciate that i travel to see them. because london and paris are closer, there it's taken more for granted. my traveling is especially appreciated on the us west coast. has your blog had an effect on your business? if so more in the uk or the us? the blog has helped my business considerably, especially in america. where it has proved particuarly helpful is bringing new people into the savile row experience, which has always been a problem for us tailors.. how has the aura of "savile row" shaped the expectations of your american customers. do they insist on a very traditional "english cut". very much so. my customers are particualarly looking for something to differentiate themselves from the far more common italian style, which i'm happy to do for them. what would you like to see more american men wearing? more bespoke, from anyone- italian, english, hong kong, it doesn't matter. what is the most satisfying element of your work? a delighted customer, and maybe a shared drink afterwards. brad pitt or johnny depp which would you most like to dress? i have no preference. however, if i could choose an actor, it would have to be daniel craig, the new james bond. he's got a bit of an edge to him. posted by the sartorialist at 6:20 pm 9 comments thursday, october 27, 2005 on the street.... midtown, manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 9:07 pm 13 comments tuesday, october 25, 2005 you heard it here first...bocce ball!! i don't know what surprised me more, seeing someone under 70 palying bocce ball or seeing someone chic playing bocce ball. posted by the sartorialist at 7:13 am 12 comments monday, october 24, 2005 style profile...jay kos the sartorialist asks jay kos ten questions about his personal style. favorite store?

brooks brothers sits on an incredible company history and a library of truly iconic styles, plus some of the most beautiful stores to house them in but can they make the store exciting in a consistent way?. i'm still not blown away when i walk into the madison ave store, but sometimes the fastest way to turn a company around is through image advertising (see abercrombie). i can't wait for next season. posted by the sartorialist at 9:10 am 5 comments milan fashion week party central style.com is right on top of the fashion week party scene.. here one of the fashion industries top sartorialists ,diego della valle, at a party he hosted for "the snippy world of new yorker fashion artist" michael roberts. photo by stephane feugere posted by the sartorialist at 8:28 am 2 comments tuesday, october 04, 2005 on the street..jay fielden, men's vogue editor in chief posted by the sartorialist at 8:27 am 4 comments pleats please! interesting article this week in the new dnr by sandra nygarad on the return of pleated pants to the runways of europe and new york. as to be expected the most insightful comments are by a member of the bergdorf team. michael bastian, fashion director bg men, explains ”the men’s wheels turn so slowly that you get this weird overlap where the least fashionable guy overlaps with the most fashionable guy. so you’ll have the guy who never left pleats and the fashion-forward guy who’s just rediscovering them.” bastian also notes “we’re desperate for a change of proportion” he feels that it will only take one designer to present the pleated pant in a truly fresh way that will turn the pleat from trendy to directional. posted by the sartorialist at 8:10 am 0 comments sunday, october 02, 2005 just bought the new paris vogue homme international edited by new creative director bruno danto. the new direction is much more sartorially savvy plus all text is in english so i can actually read my $10 magazine! if you only look at one page it has to be the photo of hollywood producer robert evans! trust me once you see it you won't be able to look away. bruce weber continues to prove he is the best photographer in the business with a huge 24 page editorial "what was, still is...". paul mather styled two very good editorial stories "all the presidents men" and "young blood". arena homme plus can you hear the footsteps?! what did you think of the new paris vogue homme international? posted by the sartorialist at 10:43 am 3 comments watch out j.crew here comes ralph's rugby ralph lauren has just opened new york's first rugby store on university place in greenwich village. rugby is priced for direct competition with j.crew and ralph's other more modernist club monaco chain. the collection retains all of ralph's signature styling but adds a slightly sinister element with its skull and cross"bones" logo embroidered on pants, as graphics on tailored dress shirts, and as patches that can be sewn on for a small additional charge. does that count as mtm?. the overall look is ralph meets the libertines( a jeffery's designer label favorite). uptown, downtown, eastside now westside. ralph will soon give his vintage inspired rrl collection another try in the west village. this time rrl will join two recently opened ralph lauren collection stores (men's and women's) on the newly chic bleecker street. construction crews are busy "aging" the site to perfection right now. posted by the sartorialist at 10:03 am 2 comments saturday, october 01, 2005 patrick mcdonald at new york fashion week i don't even know where to start with this look. i'm just glad we still have truly, literally colorful characters like mr. mcdonald still dandifying our streets. posted by the sartorialist at 11:01 pm 13 comments newer posts older posts
