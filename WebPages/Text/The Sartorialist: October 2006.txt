answer i went into the shop and asked the owner - without a second of hesitation and with a slight look of surprise that i didn't already know he said "one pocket square for each, of course." i'm not saying it is right or wrong but i love how many different opinions were left in the comment section and that several of you left very sounds reasons as to why or why not. i love when i get an idea like this and we get such strong reader participation. i will really try to get a photo this winter of the italian guys that put their gloves in the breast pocket of their overcoat. some of you thought it seemed a bit over-the-top to put a pocket square in your overcoat but i bet if you saw a guy on the street with one you would barely notice it which ,to me, makes it a perfectly subtle sartorial detail. thanks everyone!!!! posted by the sartorialist at 10:15 am 107 comments saks fifth avenue event with michael bastian thanks to everyone who braved the rain and came out to saks for the michael bastian event. it has been really wonderful to meet so many of my readers and have an opportunity to conduct these events with saks. the setting was very intimate and i think michael really opened up about the excitement and challenges of being a young designer. i thought it was interesting when michael discussed how a designer can have an inspiration, sketch it, build a collection around it and after working it for a while eventually realizing it isn't right and then have to start over. i think that takes a lot of courage to start over ,especially on a tight time schedule, but that is the kind of thing that helps designers succeed. posted by the sartorialist at 9:39 am 25 comments saks fifth avenue windows for the sartorialist i am humbled by the fantastic windows saks fifth avenue has dedicated to the sartorialist this week. we had a few general conversations about ideas for the display but i was pleasantly shocked to see what a wonderful job they did. thanks tim, and ,as always, thanks imac. posted by the sartorialist at 9:28 am 55 comments on the street.......meatpacking district, new york posted by the sartorialist at 9:12 am 43 comments sunday, october 22, 2006 at the saks event in san francisco i love the exuberance of this young girl's look. she is not a size 4 and she is not making excuses. posted by the sartorialist at 9:43 am 45 comments newer posts older posts
