i really like hong kong but beijing rocks!!! hong kong really is just like new york in the feel of the city but beijing really feels like china. it was such a challenge to shoot on the street in a city where people not only don't speak english but they don't speak a language anywhere close to my language. at least in italy i can say a few words in english or bad italian and the subject basically understands but in china they had no idea what i wanted to do. most people thought i wanted them to take a picture of me with my camera. i have never been turned down for taking a photo in my life but i guess i understand the reasons. anyway, eventually i got the hang of it and got some really great images in both hong kong and beijing that i will be posting this week. i also look forward to writing a little more to help explain what i was seeing. sorry not many (any) men's photos on this trip, the men's style ,in general, really lags behind the women's. that will be my big challenge next time. i guess it is safe to announce now that i will also start doing a page every month in vogue china starting january or february. this came up before i went on this trip. of course i was excited to do the page but after this visit i am now double, extra excited about being involved with vogue china. i will talk more about the team at lane crawford later in the week but i want to thank them again for sponsoring this trip and taking such good care of me. i would like to say i was shocked by just how good the lane crawford stores are but ,honestly, wasn't that shocked because i knew they were good but i had no idea they were that good, that level of good. i spent 15 years in sales and marketing dealing with department and specialty stores all around the world before i started this blog. during that time i developed very strong opinions about what makes a great store and what a great shopping experience should feel like. the fact that i don't write about stores very often should tell you that ,more often than not, i am rarely excited by most shopping experiences but this trip to the lane crawford at ifc and beijing was really inspiring. more than the beautiful stores and great locations, i was really impressed by the edit of the buy for each designer and the depth of strong fashion pieces. no safe, watered-down presentation of marni or dries that often happens in stores solely driven by the bottom line and lacking in a clear long range vision. ok, i can feel i'm starting to get worked up here and i could write at length about this but i have to catch my plane back to new york. i will continue this thought later in the week. thanks sarah!!

i will be in hong kong & beijing this week to attend the opening of the new lane crawford store in beijing. i have never been to asia so this will be quite an adventure. i will try to keep things on a regular schedule but just keep checking back because i have no idea what will happen. i understand that blogspot might be blocked in mainland china so i might have to email images to a friend for them to update etc. either way, i will try very hard to create some images that capture the essence of this trip and what i see. thanks to sarah rutson (a sartorialist regular) of lane crawford for making this happen. stay tuned posted by the sartorialist at 10:04 am 129 comments on the street......most chic, paris posted by the sartorialist at 9:58 am 54 comments at dries van noten posted by the sartorialist at 9:56 am 40 comments friday, october 19, 2007 a new personal favorite posted by the sartorialist at 11:24 am 160 comments on the street......near colette, paris posted by the sartorialist at 11:23 am 55 comments at chanel posted by the sartorialist at 10:18 am 83 comments thursday, october 18, 2007 at junya watanabe posted by the sartorialist at 6:45 pm 81 comments on the street......right bank, paris posted by the sartorialist at 6:45 pm 14 comments on the street......recropped, paris i think shots like this tell you almost as much about the subjects as a regular portrait posted by the sartorialist at 6:42 pm 23 comments on the street......"is she havin' a laugh?, is she havin' a laugh?", paris posted by the sartorialist at 6:39 pm 36 comments scene at the louvre posted by the sartorialist at 8:35 am 90 comments newer posts older posts
