it all is just so well played - the "unstyled" stylish haircut, the slightly rumpled wool suit, the casual dark navy knit tie, the sporty watch, and i would be willing to bet that he is wearing a brooks brothers buttondown (unbuttoned-down notice!) shirt. as i keep looking at this image the only thing that i can keep coming back to is the fact that his clothes just fit him so perfectly. he could wear exactly all the same items but if they didn't fit on him as well as they do then this would not be such an inspiring photo. you can do it guys, you can get this look with a $500 suit -just make sure to spend the extra on having it altered. posted by the sartorialist at 9:43 am 77 comments thursday, october 16, 2008 on the street.... certain elegance, milan posted by the sartorialist at 4:37 pm 83 comments when two sartorialist photographers meet on the street...there's gonna be a shoot-out mr. michel comte posted by the sartorialist at 8:52 am 45 comments on the street....photographer style, nyc posted by the sartorialist at 8:31 am 57 comments the sartorialist & gant exhibition now open the photography project i have been working on with gant is now on display at their new fifth ave flagship store. when & where: gant fifth ave @ 51st street the exhibit will be open until october 30th the exhibition is open to the public, and i would really enjoy your feedback. for more information about the project go to http://www.gant.com/thesartorialist posted by the sartorialist at 8:25 am 72 comments wednesday, october 15, 2008 on the street....jeans & jacket (part 2), nyc posted by the sartorialist at 5:05 pm 89 comments on the street.... biking beauty, milano posted by the sartorialist at 8:33 am 76 comments on the street....jeans & jacket (part 1), nyc herringbone seems tailor-made for denim. posted by the sartorialist at 8:29 am 81 comments tuesday, october 14, 2008 on the street....little star, paris posted by the sartorialist at 5:06 pm 178 comments on the street...shades & layers, paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:55 am 71 comments on the street....shoulders, paris posted by the sartorialist at 7:57 am 92 comments on the street...greys & color, milano posted by the sartorialist at 6:58 am 58 comments monday, october 13, 2008 on the street..... deep left bank, paris posted by the sartorialist at 9:17 am 86 comments on the street..... adorable, milano posted by the sartorialist at 9:15 am 65 comments sunday, october 12, 2008 personal silhouette & color story, milano posted by the sartorialist at 9:35 am 110 comments friday, october 10, 2008 on the street..... in the air, nyc & paris posted by the sartorialist at 8:11 am 260 comments newer posts older posts
