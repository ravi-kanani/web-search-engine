great turnout and really cool people. dallas was also really cool, but i forgot my stupid camera so you will just have to take my word on that. a big thanks to all of the people who waited in line for hours. i took this picture out of the window behind my signing table. it must have taken these people another 2 hours before they got to the front of the line. don't let this scare you though, while i was in d.c. three different couples told me they had met at my gallery exhibit two years before. i guess it is not such a bad formula to bring together well-dressed men and women in a cool setting with a few free drinks. again i'm so proud of the variety of people - vintage, trads, glams... all across the board. posted by the sartorialist at 7:03 pm 94 comments on the street....via borgonuovo, milano posted by the sartorialist at 5:09 pm 127 comments on the street....the driver, san francisco one of my favorite encounters on this book tour was my driver in san francisco. as you can see he was very elegant and practically oozed self-confidence, dignity and pride in his work. i love people who show pride in their work, regardless of the job. this man's car was spotless, his shoes were shined and he knew exactly where he was going. he wasn't dressed like that for me, he had no idea who i was, this was just another day and just another ride done in his own stylish way. i've said this so many times before, and recently in the intro of my book. even though this blog is about fashion i don't really think about fashion when i look at this photo. i think about how he is communicating his sense of pride and self-worth; not by how expensive his clothes are but by how he wears his clothes, his posture and his politeness. this man is pure style. posted by the sartorialist at 12:52 pm 257 comments on the street....commerce st., dallas i was so impressed by all of the cool people i met on last weeks book tour. young, old, rich, less than rich. in d.c. they kept saying, "wow, i've never seen so many fashionable people in one place in d.c." my only regret is that i didn't get a chance to shoot more of the people at the events. however, i did find two people that may end up working for me in the future (i always have my eye open, even if it's not behind a camera). we will be announcing some new tour dates shortly, and we are looking for the right partners to host an event in boston and philadelphia soon (while garance is in town). i can say right now that it looks like i will be taking my first trip to madrid and barcelona very, very, soon. thanks again everyone!
