(1:22 pm) : i mean of course she is wildly hot. but i dont think it is that "fair" or in the full spirit of the place. to be clear, i am not trying to be politically correct. just laying it out there. is she a babe ? yes. is the grey/orange mix classy ? sure are the short shorts the major impact point ? i think so ! roxie said ...

(1:47 pm) : i love the photo and the kjacques!!! anonymous said ... (1:49 pm) : not feelin' this one. i think the weight of the short's fabric doesn't work for me. or the matching collar color? maybe if the bottom half had a little more power-something from the waist to the tops of those sandals seem a little too anemic for my taste. reeftraveler said ... (1:52 pm) : nice contrast between the grey and the peach, but a cable sweater in the middle of a heat wave? alexa said ...

(2:22 pm) : re: the "isn't she too hot in this?" question-- maybe she layers clothing for work. the air conditioning in my workplace is so freezing that i have to wear a sweater everyday. i often go outside just to warm up for a minute. if this is the case for her, perhaps when she's done with work, she'll take the sweater off and romp in her romper. ;) lipstick sunshine said ... (2:22 pm) : this is so fabulously chic! the outfit looks so put together and on trend, and i love how effortless the whole image is, with her hair just thrown up. she's a lady who knows style. anonymous said ... (2:24 pm) : sydney edmonds?? anonymous said ... (2:30 pm) : great sweater & nifty color combination, but i do believe that a general acceptance of rompers as a fashion item is a sign that the apocalypse is nigh. re: the comments about the weather/the look's "realism": the shadows suggest that this photo was taken early in the morning. many east coast mornings are fairly cool, even in hot weather, so layering with an open-knit sweater (note the amount of coral visible between the stitches) could very well make sense. also, if she's heading off to a place that's heavily air-conditioned, a light sweater would once again make sense--i know i'd wear or bring one. in short: people experience temperatures differently. the fact that you'd be sweating in her outfit doesn't make her "inappropriate" or a fashion victim. unknown said ... (2:37 pm) : stunning anonymous said ... (2:38 pm) : love the look, but makes me sweat just looking at it. it is soooo muggy in nyc today! j said ... (2:39 pm) : a very sweet look. but all i can think is that she must be an alien because there's no way i would be layering cable-knit anything in this weather! lollipop4598 said ... (2:52 pm) : i love those sandals. i absolutely love sandals that have a bit of toughness to them. you need them to balance a cute outfit so that it doesn't become cutesy. plus, sandals like that are very flattering, actually. the color combination is amazing, of course, and her face is beautiful. i like the hair too. everything looks perfect. marcela said ... (2:59 pm) : i like her look, it is the kind of thing tha my mother would never approve, she would not understand why the top is covered while leaving the legs exposed. i love it, it is young and cool, and jumpsuits are great especially in a shorts version. leonie said ... (2:59 pm) : beautiful outfit! love the pink and gray together :-) http://thesignaturebow.blogspot.com/ new post: vintage living project curve said ... (3:03 pm) : since i don't know about the weather of the place she is in i won't remark on that.but this is a bit odd as in different..love her styling otherwise though. http://flysongbird.blogspot.com http://twitter.com/debi_songbird yogaspy said ... (3:03 pm) : those sandals are gonna wreck her feet. she has flat arches and they're collapsing. not too attractive (both sandals and collapsing arches). regarding the key piece here: her cable-knit sweater is making my skin feel prickly, even thousands of miles away in cool, breezy, fresh vancouver. overall: no. chichiloves... said ... (3:06 pm) : great outfit and great photo! http://fashionqamar.blogspot.com/ remy said ... (3:10 pm) : the combination of grey, silver and pink is great, the sandals are ugly. the sulking expression of the professional model and the desolate environment are depressing. and yes, yes, yes, by now we all know it's hot in ny. greetings from a rainy amsterdam. marisa alma said ... (3:32 pm) : gorgeous girl! a very unusual combination of fabric and color (a cable knit sweater in a heat wave), but it works. i like the salmon and grey together. great shot! anonymous said ... (3:39 pm) : i would hand-knit a very simple pullover in this color of linen yarn before i would grab an old sweater like this to put on at the end of july. the cables pattern in the sweater are thick & bulky and made for winter! unknown said ... (3:41 pm) : the grey and colar colour combination works incredibly good! also the use of these very different fabrics look amazing! really nice outfit! x je suis sophie anonymous said ... (3:46 pm) : while i think it's a lovely outfit and she is undoubtedly a very beautiful woman, i really wish she had a different expression on her face. if i look a couple photos down... now, that's a beautiful woman -- yes, she is physically beautiful but it's the smile that takes it over the top. it shows that beauty is as much about a woman's physical beauty as it is about her expression,. evan said ... (3:48 pm) : adorable..miss nyc http://mysocalledboringlife-evan.blogspot.com/ anonymous said ... (3:55 pm) : the sewater is vince-i got it at barneys. unknown said ... (3:58 pm) : love this pink and grey, brilliant mix http://elenavasilieva.blogspot.com/ x byemma said ... (3:59 pm) : perfection from the hairdo till the shoes anonymous said ... (4:12 pm) : this sassy lady is obviously "man repelling." i love it. lou said ... (4:16 pm) : i agree this is cute, and very up-to-date with the cable sweater, the coral pink, the sandals and the cuff bracelet. she's very aware of what's hot and what's not: which takes at least *some* effort and a specific interest in fashion. therefor, here as elsewhere i'm a bit amazed at how often commenters find the looks "effortless." effortless is a myth surrounding chic and in particular, though not exclusively, french chic. none of the looks that sart photographs ever seem effortless or 'carelessly thrown together' to me. they are all calculated for effect by people who care quite a great deal about how they look, however naturally beautiful they are (or are not). and it pays off in these examples, so good for them!! mon sac by me said ... (4:23 pm) : absolutly awesome !!! http://monsacbyme.com nakedqueen said ... (4:28 pm) : great look! love this suit and jumper caribbelle said ...

(7:32 pm) : fashion that conflicts with the seasons has always bothered me. i enjoy a happy medium of fashion sense and practicality. when the two are in direct competition with one another, well... that girl is wearing a sweater in the middle of summer. the nation is hotter than hades and this chick is wearing a sweater. anonymous said ... (8:09 pm) : to all the people who say she is a model; she is very attractive. but i have never seen a model that is short, long waisted, and with size c at least in the bra. i do like her expression however. i like smiling, but not all the time. the reason i noted this is i wish there were models like her. her body type is a lot more attainable then the typical model with a 44 inch inseam. in fact thats sort of my body type. glenn said ... (8:12 pm) : a wonderful image of a very beautiful woman, but i'm also impressed by the fact that you actually had some shadow in which for her to stand. that gave the soft light that she deserved and shows her and the outfit quite well. good eye scott... :-) margaretbeth said ... (8:34 pm) : she is gorgeous. but how come her legs think it's beach-time and her top thinks she's heading for the snow? anonymous said ... (8:37 pm) : the sweater is vince and it is a cotton yarn. she's not crazy... anonymous said ... (9:05 pm) : beautiful woman. i like the way the colors come together. sweater in the summer? if she likes it, i love it. however, for people who are unfamiliar with summers on the east coast of the u.s. they are not the type of heat that people in the western states have (the kind where it's cool in the mornings and evenings). no! no! no! east coast heat is a mixture of high temperatures and stifling humidity that feels like having a heavy, damp, wool blanket over you anytime that you're outside (doesn't matter whether it's 4am or 11pm). last week the temps hovered in the 100 degree range plus humidity above 70%. makes death valley feel like a cool breeze on a tropical island. it's the humidity, not necessarily the heat per se, that makes east coast summers so oppressive. yes, people experience temperatures differently, but even in the coldest office, you'd warm up in 3 minutes in the nyc heat/humidity that is common in the summer. and that is what makes a photo like this appear to be staged. again, if she's comfortable, i'm happy for her. anonymous said ... (9:45 pm) : i think she's beautiful. take her beauty out of the equation, and the outfit isn't flying for me, though i do love the color combo. it's 90 degrees where i am on the east coast, and i'm trying to understand the sweater, which is making this getup more odd. anonymous said ... (9:47 pm) : fyi - her sweater his banana republic - currently in stores - i just bought it myself recently... feels as amazing as it looks! candi said ... (9:51 pm) : cute cute cute! adj said ... (10:28 pm) : wow, this woman is stunning. i mean really incredible. and i love the color combination. the photograph looks as if it was taken in a park in europe. gotta love nyc the chameleon. www.greeneggsandglam.blogspot.com sofi said ... (10:32 pm) : love the simplicity of the outfit...and the fact that her hair is up in a messy bun rather than looking like she tried to hard. sometimes you just need to pull your hair up and she executes this gracefully. thanks for sharing! anonymous said ... (10:53 pm) : it's time to do a study and take a look at the women who turn in their toes, and the ones that don't. clothing, nationality, hair length...i'm fascinated by the body language of it. anonymous said ... (11:53 pm) : love this, not for the middle of the summer, but great inspiration for sept/oct outfits. maya said ...

(12:53 am) : i like join these colors. nice! stella said ... (1:28 am) : she looks utterly chic, but who is crazy enough to wear a sweater during this summer in the city. madness! i'm totally jealous sweating in a tank. anonymous said ... (1:39 am) : to anonymous 9:05--since you were obviously responding to me, let me clarify: i grew up in new england and spent years on the mid-atlantic/chesapeake seaboard, so i know my east coast weather. :) i was one of those people who often did wear loose cotton sweaters early in the morning, especially when i was heading for work--the same humidity that makes most people feel overheated actually often made me feel chilly, dank, and gross until it really warmed up, and intense ac always makes me feel chilled. that's why her outfit looks realistic to me--been there, done that (but not as chicly). but i see your point, defer to your first-hand knowledge if it's been far too hot recently for anyone to possibly feel chilled, and thank you for your thoughtful and civil disagreement. :) shivani gakhar said ... (2:53 am) : looks nice, but i never understand how someone can wear a sweater with shorts? is it warm or cold? make up your mind! anonymous said ... (3:17 am) : omg i'm in love ! mike said ... (4:18 am) : i love this vibe the outfit diaries said ... (4:34 am) : cool outfit! love her sweater rhiannon_rattray said ... (4:53 am) : gorgeous! xxxx anonymous said ... (5:00 am) : this woman is stunning...a vision...gloriously gorgeous. there's no doubt she could make any garment look amazing; i'm sure she'd take my breath away in a simple white t-shirt and jeans. still, this style of seemingly conflicting clothing weights amuses me as if she was thinking how chilly her torso would be outdoors while opting for the shorts to keep her legs cool. nevertheless, a lovely sight and an altogether tolerable incongruity. beesandbugs said ... (6:03 am) : i totally fell in love with that look! don't know if it's a romper or shorts and a shirt, but it looks great! and the girl is soo beautiful! maybe she makes the clothes look so good altogether :) adriana said ...

(9:25 pm) : how funny. the same people that loved the velvet jacket over a short tan skirt on the page before seem to not like shorts with a light cotton sweater, yet its the same covered on top bare on the bottom thing. really its no different then jeans and a tank top. can anyone tell me what she has on under the sweater. i looked for a jumper like this, but found nothing matching. its got to be one piece. is it a one piece? pensive pumpkin said ... (10:26 pm) : i love the juxtaposition of these disconnected elements. then again, i am fond of contrast in lots of forms. the nonchalant hair makes it for me. thehaflife said ...
