(4:19 pm) : that pale brown/tan color is perfect for this guy's hair and beard color. and the slightly rumpled looks of the wrinkles works oddly well for him! - david top 10 aloe vera juice benefits holistic nutrition and health tayler worrell said ...

(5:00 pm) : i am enjoying the juxtaposition between the formality of the suit's cut with its informally wrinkled state cynthia fox-giddens said ... (5:12 pm) : sharp look and very well-groomed. i did a double take on the wrinkled suit, it's ok ;-) sandy scott said ...

(8:13 pm) : the wrinkled jacket doesn't bother me as much as the placement of the buttons. he looks like an inverted triangle. christian durango said ... (8:36 pm) : i saw this guy in the tate. the first time i passed him i said out loud to a friend that he was a famous person, and he winked at me. then i saw him again and it looked like he was writing down every name from a huge list of famous artists on a wall near the escalators. he looked exactly the same except he was rocking a blue blazer, some rolled up khakis and i think some sneakers. his head is truly large, and it doesn't help that he is actually rather short. claudia albuquerque said ... (8:46 pm) : nice this guy in camel!!! original and fashionable! xoxo www.brazilianhighsociety.blogspot.com anonymous said ... (8:54 pm) : i don't mind natural wrinkles in fabric, but the sleeves look forced and trying to hard wrinkled. he's still quite a dapper guy though. anonymous said ... (8:54 pm) : his jacket's wrinkled. i love his attire. it's so masculine-o-chic. http://daniimodafolli.blogspot.com anonymous said ... (8:55 pm) : you've featured him before, haven't you? i like his style. the good: 1. the shades 2. the beard (i hope the trend lasts, i wish his was a little trimmer though) 3. the hair (nice length, & guys look good in slick styles, as the vintage photos prove) 4. the colors (suit, tie, shirt, etc. they suit his face, his hair color, the background and the sunny day.) 5. the tie 6. the tie/shirt color combo (i like the whole tone-on-tone thing, even if it's not cool to like it) 5. the double-breasted suit 6. his profile 7. his attitude the imo not-so-good: 1. the wrinkles (sorry, just a little too much) 2. the cut of the suit (a little too baggy for my taste, though in my world there would be room for all type of cuts: slim/skinny, wider/more relaxed, etc.) the interesting: 1. his tie is slim and his lapels are wide. that goes against conventional advice (i.e. match tie and lapel width) but here it works. maybe matching the tie color to the shirt helps. sorry for rambling. great blog! anonymous said ... (9:03 pm) : brown-paper-lunch-bag-chic! anonymous said ... (10:18 pm) : great suit, great color. his head seems disproportionately large for body and size of hands. anonymous said ... (10:24 pm) : i think i'm in love --<3---> anonymous said ... (10:39 pm) : i love his hair. and his glasses. the rest is great too though. the end said ... (11:02 pm) : fantastic shades... love how the green pops where the light hits the frames. marc said ... (11:29 pm) : seriously folks: poplin in the summer is a wrinkly suit. it's supposed to be that way. jesus, were all of you raised wearing nuke-proof polyester? he's stylish, fashionable, and the embodiment of sprezz... enjoy it. ana g said ... (11:32 pm) : trenchcoat style. lazycatstyle anonymous said ... (12:48 am) : the shirt/tie tone-on-tone allow the focus to be on the suit, where it should be! lisa (aka sweetie) said ... (1:03 am) : this guy is very chic with this double breast look. xo lisa anonymous said ... (1:10 am) : i don't care for this shade of brown in the summer. autumn-yes. spring-yes. summer-no. leaves are waaaaaaaay too wrinkled. they look like tobacco leaves. suit jacket looks ill-fitting. his beard looks too hot (as in temperature-wise, not coolness) for this time of year. anonymous said ... (1:15 am) : this is not fashion, it's a wrinkled mess me said ... (1:31 am) : not a fan of the wrinkles. my mother would disown me if she saw me outside the house in a suit as wrinkly as that one. http://ccmcj.blogspot.com/ anonymous said ... (1:38 am) : not working for me, too much fabric in a suit that should be tightly tailored. the casual wrinkles don't bother me. the hair does though.. how you say: douchey... barcelona m'enamora said ... (1:52 am) : nice suit! it's perfect or people who don't like ironing!!! isn't it? regards from barcelona! brendan said ... (2:10 am) : i like the bold black buttons on his jacket, especially with the black polka dots on his tie. subtle coordination in the details. http://oecodomic.blogspot.com/ william turner said ... (2:36 am) : hey looks so cool, really very fantastic shades..... thanks to share, leather jacket anonymous said ... (3:20 am) : my, what an effect the tan crinkle has — almost cardboard-like. psh said ... (4:15 am) : gorgeous look! and the photo, too! even the wrinkles look awesome. were they made on purpose? fashionthroughtravel said ... (4:19 am) : i love his sunglasses! don't know what to say about those wrinkles on the suit though... fashionthroughtravel.blogspot.com bring it back to me. said ...

(5:33 am) : beards are deadly. should be more of them. he wins on beard factor alone. suit - meh. tikkitiboo + ahka vintage enter our $200 giveaway here! anonymous said ... (5:37 am) : compelling shot...the light gleaming off his hair is spectacular...but, there's something wacky about this image. maybe it's his remarkably large head, accentuated by the cropped up the nape hair cut, contrasted by a rather petite body and hands. i don't find the wrinkled suit nearly as off-putting as the distractingly dark buttons. pusat tas branded impor said ... (5:45 am) : wow! nice! greencoat said ... (6:42 am) : he's a good-looking guy but the suit is just silly. it looks as he's wearing a paper bag. antique engagement rings said ... (6:44 am) : just as i may say... fantastic! anonymous said ... (6:45 am) : the fabric is very casual..... double breasted...structured ......shirt and necktie....not with this fabric... anonymous said ... (7:38 am) : do you guys love everything? this is a disgrace on wearing a db suit with such ugly creases. mr s said ... (8:21 am) : he looks like a caricature drawn on (very crumpled)brown paper. personal opinion, but i'm not sure this look works - the shirt and tie look far too formal for the suit, and the glasses look a little too thick rimmed for my liking. the thing about comments though are that they are one's own personal thoughts - one man's brown bag, is another mans personal statement great blog n steve said ... (8:24 am) : wore hard and put up wet. wrinkles are not to be worn. steve schnier said ... (8:32 am) : very stylish. he looks like an aristocratic character out of a tintin comic book. itsthenewblack said ... (9:10 am) : love the list 'anonymous'!!! great blog as always- like this guy's poise. x christina simon said ... (9:32 am) : i am not sure about the beard, but hey, he looks great. very stylish. honestly, we need more men in suits. seriously. the world would be a better (looking) place. :-) luciana steckel said ... (9:43 am) : i'm absolutely proud of him! a real gentleman. anonymous said ... (10:18 am) : i like the suit! i'd like it better with a t-shirt, though, or a less tailored shirt and tie. it'd still be a juxtaposition, but a more summery, comfortable one. anonymous said ... (10:40 am) : relaxed, yet a classic look. anyone know what kind of glasses. sharp. anonymous said ... (11:23 am) : love the wrinkly suit look and his silhouette, head, hair, beard, boxy suit. but he jacket doesn't seem to fit quite right, especially on the right shoulder. still amazing@ beauty lies in imperfection... bibi said ... (11:34 am) : he's just trying too hard. the hair, the glasses, the beard, the suit, the buttons...the wrinkles! any one of these would have made a statement. fabrizio rollo said ... (11:45 am) : thank you all! love, fabrizio* fabrizio rollo said ... (11:47 am) : many thanks! grazie mille! love, fabrizio* marília said ... (12:48 pm) : wonderfull! patrícia favalle said ...

(5:13 pm) : super! marilia martins said ... (10:33 pm) : gorgeous!! art deco engagement rings said ... (10:33 pm) : again i love linen.. his look is so wonderful. anonymous said ... (11:25 pm) : it's like he went swimming in his suit, and it dried a bit snug and wrinkly... ceramic tile said ... (4:11 am) : so nice style laurence john said ... (4:45 am) : from what i've seen of fabrizio's other outfits, he wouldn't be happy unless he was pushing the boundaries of conventional taste. anonymous said ... (4:53 am) : fear the beard!! anonymous said ... (7:44 am) : when a supposedly relaxed look becomes ostentatious is not good. anonymous said ... (8:05 am) : crease clothe not a fashion trend for sure! my god! anonymous said ... (8:42 am) : he would be cool in a fitted linen suit. jordana @ white cabana said ... (9:52 am) : the paper bag prince. miguel said ... (10:25 am) : lovin the wrinkle suit, not sure if i would wear it myself but i would get out of the house faster. the tie and shades are sick and are what make him such and interesting specimen. hfreemansons.blogspot.com subtropical zone girl said ... (12:44 pm) : i am not loving it. the wrinkled look seems contrived. anonymous said ... (1:03 pm) : no. rumpled is one thing. the unlikely vertical creases along the sleeves make me think this is calculated. back to remedial maths class for this guy. kimberley california said ... (2:17 pm) : i'm loving those frames... anonymous said ... (2:46 pm) : love the wrinkly fabric of the suit--it's perfect for a hot, humid summer day & looks great with the classic shirt and pale tie, and he's sharp enough that the look is clearly intentional. the fabric would look even better and summery-er, though, deployed in a single-breasted jacket with lighter buttons (preferably worn open). i think that tightening the line of the beard (specifically by shaving the neck & bringing the cheek line down a bit) would highlight his features & balance the above-the-neck proportions a bit better. sophistafunk said ... (3:48 pm) : great shot, great suit. anonymous said ... (4:30 am) : jaws! simon brown said ... (9:05 am) : a very pleasing combination. nice to see a fellow beard wearer too, even though i keep mine like simone's. that full set looks way too hot for a summer in paris. just a pity the gentleman appears to know neither his suit size nor how to use an iron. it has however let me hear my ex-royal navy officer father's voice in my memory when he was still hale. stern design said ... (9:56 am) : fun shades! me and my friends said ... (10:31 am) : cool... anonymous said ... (10:33 am) : if only his suit was ironed. his glasses are awesome! silvia said ... (1:31 pm) : the wrinkle outfit is...strange, but his haircut makes me want to get my scissor! anonymous said ... (12:16 am) : he looks like a paper bag. en mode fashion said ... (3:42 am) : great suit, great color. alastair said ... (7:13 am) : the suit is too much for me! even if it might be linen, i am not digging the wrinkles, especially the sleeves. also the lapels look huge to me! pretty 'thought-provoking' shot anyway, cheers scott. marilândia marques rollo said ... (4:14 pm) : a charming man... love. zuccotto said ... (6:24 pm) : i've posted before on this, but probably a couple of years ago. i'm fine with wrinkles, and i think the fashion world and thus fashion followers are way too wrinkle avoidant. as a wrinkled linen wearer (i think it's stupid to iron a linen shirt/blouse and wrinkle it within seconds of putting it on), i've noticed disapproving stares. luckily, i'm old enough to shine that all on. anonymous said ... (11:56 pm) : hilarious. what a way to enjoy summer.nice tie. post a comment newer posts older posts
