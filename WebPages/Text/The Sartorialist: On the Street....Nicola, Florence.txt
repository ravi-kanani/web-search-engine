(7:42 pm) : oh, these dapper italian men bring back memories! i went to italy in 1980 with a youth orchestra - the style of the men was worlds apart from angel flights and feathered hair! at certain points they decided we needed a little 'security' and sent in the caribineri - even they were peacocks. sigh. of course, when i grew up i married man of sicilian descent and now i iron his tee shirts for him ;) steph marcel da chump said ... (8:03 pm) : boots not cap toes with a blue blazer and contrasting slacks, for me at least. i once worked for a garment center executive who owned two pair of exquisite boots, custom made in italy. he wore them with a similar ensemble as nicola's, but to a much more refined effect. brittany matthews said ...

(11:43 pm) : would really like to get a closer look at that timepiece. its hard to find a classic with a cream/yellow face like that. im dreaming that the number on the face are roman numerals....if they are, perfection ! feefee said ... (12:14 am) : wow. aaron said ... (12:40 am) : the watchstrap makes the look fall just short of perfect. but 98% is still an a+ gabriel said ... (12:41 am) : beautiful example of sophistication through understament and subtlety. while i wouldn't wear a jacket with a peaked lapel that wide or with vents that are that deep, i'd love to steal the rest of this look, or to at least adopt some of the ideas behind it. it's a beautiful balance of casual elegance: playful without being showy or loud, laidback but not rumpled, modern yet timeless at the same time. i also admire how even the wispy beard and the tousled hair don't diminish any of the look's sharpness. love the micro-patterned shirt with the tie, the overlapping ticket pocket, and those particular shades of blue and khaki together. and, of course, he had to be italian! outinsight said ... (2:07 am) : what a gent! i love his shirt! joannalogue said ... (2:27 am) : no one ever made the sock striptease look this good before! anonymous said ...

(3:39 am) : wowww the milanese gentleman! or the firenze gentleman! or the milanese lady! why all the italian men have the same haircut style? mysterious, repetitious behaviour kisses from villaconejos (spain) anonymous said ... (3:49 am) : "ladies. look at your man. now look at my hair. back at your man. now look at my socks. oh yes. polka-dot legwear love surprise. your man can't dress like me. but if he wears long socks his ankles could look like mine. i'm on a horse." anonymous said ... (3:57 am) : another anonymous person above wrote, "there are so many photos of people wearing this exact blazer." oh no, there are not. if only that were true. it's in the details: two sleeve buttons spaced apart just so; side vents; fearlessly wide peaked lapels; the slightly-lighter-than-navy hue of the cloth. a front shot would be nice, but from what can be seen, this is an uncommonly handsome blazer, not a sleep-inducing number churned out by polo ralph lauren. this is outfit is what it should be. well-dresed men build their style on the accumulation of small details. betty said ... (4:05 am) : absolutely perfect . selina. said ...

(11:42 am) : yessss new generation of dandy... nicola have a magnetic flux! hey mister. said ... (11:45 am) : yay. i love when boys know how to dress!! anonymous said ... (12:01 pm) : anonymous@3:57 wrote "well-dresed men build their style on the accumulation of small details." well said, and this is an example of why. if he'd chosen plain socks, shirt and blazer he would still look very good and elegant but the added details give his outfit an extra dimension and a subtle edge. the patterned socks add a witty note to his outfit. the details also give us more to talk about :) i love the colors, especially the color of the blazer. any man would look good this summer in a jacket and trousers in these shades. is this it? models review said ... (12:46 pm) : love the details especially - so the shirt and the socks are amazing... :) http://www.isthisitmodelsreview.com/ briony said ...
