(12:32 am) : i have been trolling etsy for similar cotton shirtwaist dresses from the 50s/60s -- this is why! they are perfect, modest for summer. i have an ancient one, green, that i've patched together so many times it's really not decent to wear anymore, though i still do -- the sartorialist would not approve! it's beyond grunge; the fabric has worn off the buttons, etc. i had another, in blue, dropped it at the drycleaner's, and someone stole the buttons off it! anyway, that's my story; love this look. yogaspy said ... (12:38 am) : cute hair, beautiful skin, indie retro style, classic dress and keds, slim build. but she could really use some iyengar yoga for her posture. anonymous said ... (12:41 am) : it's all good, but it's the shoes that make the look 'pop'. sexy, innocent and sophisticated all at once. priceless! anonymous said ... (12:50 am) : she is perfect! tempting wax poetic about this look but "perfection" sums up my thoughts. nomi lubin said ...

(12:45 pm) : i love not only what she is wearing (the word 'swell' comes to mind) but the expression and pose you have captured here. simply lovely. m.edwin said ... (12:52 pm) : this makes for a stunning portrait shot - the light, sunlit greenery framing her torso and face and the shaded tree providing a nice backdrop to her wonderful expression. kibbles 'n knits said ...

(8:12 pm) : great evidence that you don't have to rely on short shorts and tank tops to stay cool in hot weather! love the length of the dress. just-below-the knees hems do wonders for elongating the figure (not that this slim gal needs it) and just looks so put together. ivory said ...
