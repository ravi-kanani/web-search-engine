recently i discussed the vf best dressed list, though i wasn't a big fan of the vf list i have to say that the gq list of 50 "most stylish men" is very good. the choices are well done and the images chosen to illustrate those choices are superb. ok, enough gq for the day posted by the sartorialist at 6:05 pm 51 comments on the street.......carolina herrera, manhattan posted by the sartorialist at 9:26 am 90 comments gq @ 50 party gq had it's 50th anniversary party last night in new york and what a bash!! kanye west performed a private show that rocked (would "rocked" be correct for hip-hop singing?) i didn't bring my regular camera because i just wanted to have fun but once the show started the photographer in me took over and i broke out the cellphone camera. anyway, the cover of the oct gq that i got is really cool. it has an old image of paul newman which is shocking in it's perfection. i'm asking if i can scan it and post it today. i'm telling you, it will be the first thing you see this month when you walk into barnes & noble or kroger's (indy supermarket) or any newsstand. the old covers and review of the last fifty years inside is really incredible - it would have been perfect beach reading or long plane trip to europe reading!
