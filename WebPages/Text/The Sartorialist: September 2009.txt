bike ride. he was dressed so elegantly for a sunday ride, but i guess i should expect that from milanese by now. our conversation was very brief and i forgot to get any of his contact information. i was very happy with the shot, but thought i would never run across him again. well, as i was shooting around the versace show i see just the floating head of this gentleman glide by (his body and bike were hidden by a car). traffic was heavy so as he slowed to navigate the cars and fashionistas i caught up to him and asked to take his photo. i was surprised when he instantly recognized me, "yeah, you are the sartorialist!, cunningham!" that bill casts a long shadow. this time i got his info, so hopefully we will be seeing more of mr. alborghetti on future milan trips. posted by the

all about his umbrella (one of the 20 in his collection) and how he uses it as a perfect prop in this photo. this is grace, this is dignity, this is real style. ps. i know the collar sits away a little, but i think that it is more a process of aging than of the original fitting. posted by the sartorialist at 8:03 am 58 comments on the street....erin o'connor, london posted by the sartorialist
