what was something that i loved that they almost always universally make everywhere in the world? i thought about it long and hard but ultimately couldn‚Äôt come up with anything. i mean, i love beef chow fun, but do i really want to eat beef chow fun everywhere ‚Äì even potentially in egypt? it was mike who came up with chocolate chip cookies. and it was perfect! i deeply, deeply love chocolate chip cookies. and we see them almost everywhere, from humble mom and pop bakeries in the middle of america, to high end patisseries in paris. and so, my search begins. i‚Äôm going to try to eat a chocolate chip cookie from every city we visit. i‚Äôm on a search for the best chocolate chip cookie in the world. let me know where your favorites are and i will definitely search them out. is it crazy to travel for chocolate chip cookies? yes. am i crazy? yes, for cookies! a note on my perfect chocolate chip cookie: my perfect chocolate chip cookie is thick, with crisp caramelized edges, soft and chewy insides, a slightly gooey center, and pools of melty chocolate. the cookie part needs to have that caramelized hint of toffee and i like larger pools of semi sweet dark chocolate rather than small milk chocolate chips. warm is always better but a good cookie is a good cookie. a great cookie even tastes good they next day. each cookie will be rated on a 25 point scale, 5 points each for edges, middles, chocolate, cookie, and taste. please let me know your favorite chocolate chip cookies. with luck, i hope to try them all!
