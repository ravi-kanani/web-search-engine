to listen to the garyvee audio experience on google home, simply say “ok google, listen to the garyvee audio experience podcast.” the same works for the amazon alexa, amazon echo and amazon echo show. 😉 leave a review on itunes and let me know what you think <3! in my opinion and with help from my team, here are a few episodes you should listen to first. 1. the difference between a winning and losing mindset if this episode of my podcast doesn’t give you even the slightest glimpse of a better perspective on how you can create opportunities everywhere and always be on offense, you’re out of luck. i’m super humbled that the one of my fans, the mulligan brothers, was willing to take the time to make this in video format, which my team then took and repurposed into an episode of my podcast. 2. advice to a young man that many of you need by far, this is one of my most viral clips. this episode of the podcast is advice that i gave to a great young man on how he can grow his personal brand, social media influence, and self-awareness. if you’re looking to get your self-awareness up, you need to listen to this. do you know yourself, or do you aspire to be something you might actually no be? 3. tips and strategies for small businesses a mashup of some of the best moments from different episodes of the #askgaryvee show! as many of you know, i’m super passionate about small businesses; from helping grow my dad’s wine store to launching vaynermedia as a small business, i’ve lived and breathed this world. being said, in honor of small business week, i decided to release this episode specifically for other small business owners. i hope you enjoy! 4. 7 reasons why i give away my content for free & why you should too no one else’s success is coming out of your pocket. if you really want to understand what i mean when i say that, listen to this episode of the podcast because it will completely change the way you look at creating content on the internet. i think that this is especially important because it’s a topic that so many people overlook. if you give value constantly, good things happen. 5. a keynote: haste and hustle, toronto 2018 this keynote is all-time when it comes to practical business advice and self-awareness! if you want to hear why i think so many entrepreneurs are in way over their heads before they even start and why i think that’s dangerous, this one may be for you. i also touch up on some business strategies for any entrepreneur that is wanting to start or grow a business; hint, you need to have a really good understanding of the marketing tools of today. 6. 4 fire rants to get you started when i’m on, i’m on. if you need some monday motivation or just something to get you going in the morning, this is exactly what you’re looking for! wanting to start that business, finally start going to the gym, or just go out and crush it? these four classics are a combo that will get you fired up to go and absolutely dominate life. 7. finding your motivation and passion i seriously get thousands of emails from people everyday and so many of those people ask me “gary, how do i find my passion?” or will tell me that they want to give up on what they’re doing because they haven’t seen the results yet… look, if you don’t love what you’re doing every single day, and you feel like quitting or giving up, this is for you. 8. no excuses if you have made a single excuse in the past month, regardless of the context of the situation, you need to hear this. i’m always empathetic when people have “real shit” going on and have had a rough start, but you have to understand that you’re 100% in control. don’t believe me? hear me out and listen to this episode of the podcast. 9. advice to millenials millenials have been given this reputation of being lazy and a younger generation negatively dominated by technology. so, if you were born between 1981 – 1996 or you know someone who thinks of millenials in a negative light, this is an absolute must-listen! this is specifically targeted at the young women and men that will are the business leaders of tomorrow. p.s: there’s a reason why i’m pushing my kids to get more screen time, not less… 10. a keynote: live your legacy hero series at draper university total fire in this keynote that i gave in san francisco at draper university! the era that we’re living in truly is about as great as it possibly could be – yes, i know that there are wars, and political disagreements, and all sorts of other minute issues, but in the macro, this is the greatest era to be alive. the internet truly changed everything and gave us all sorts of possibilities. want to hear my full pov on what the internet really has done for us? give this episode of my podcast a quick listen 😉 11. overcoming anxiety and the fear of losing one of the biggest reasons why people don’t start is because they fear the loss. people are scared of losing, especially in entrepreneurship, because they’re worried about what other people will think about their loss. please, please let me help you understand why you shouldn’t fear the losses and why your losses actually give you leverage and allow you to rise like a phoenix and stick it to the faces of all of the people that judge you. 12. an all-time keynote at sxsw 2016 this keynote really put me up, so i wanted to put it out there as a quick throw back. when i say all-time, that’s an understatement. i still believe this keynote to be one of my best pieces of content, which is why so much great advice and many viral videos have come from it. if you’ve ever seen the clip where i said “nobody gives a f*ck about your feelings bro” and wanted to get the full context, here you go! 13. a keynote: prsm 2018 in nashville, tennessee this is a keynote that i gave in nashville that really hones in on retail, restaurants, and facilities. to give you a taste of what this was all about, i talked about how social media is not just “a cool thing that college kids use” anymore, and frankly, we’re at the point where it’s so massive that the government is having to hop in to enforce certain regulations. times are changing, don’t get stuck in the past. 14. diving deep into my background and beginnings i already know that a ton of you are going to get fired up by this interview that i did on drama’s short story long podcast. we take a really deep dive into the humble beginnings of my career and what my long term strategy is for buying the new york jets. if you want to really understand why i always tell people that i’m going to buy the jets in 20 years and not in 2, watch this interview – i promise it will change your perspective on what patience really is. 15. the knicks, tom brady, & jordan sneakers this interview on barstool’s kfcradio was fire. it had a bit of a twist to it in comparison to my typical interviews, but i loved it. if you want to start to love losing and, more importantly, understand why i love losing, this is something that you need to hear. the principles that i cover in this interview nearly set the foundation of how i keep my mindset in such a good place 24/7. this was definitely a special interview 😉 16. #askgaryvee with hasan minhaj i can confidently say that hasan minhaj isn’t only an amazing comedian and correspondent on the daily show, he’s one of my biggest fans and one of the best guests i’ve ever had on the #askgaryvee show! this all-time episode is one that i really, really don’t want you to miss out on. diving into topics like his origin story and coming up as a first-generation immigrant, i would be super happy and humbled if you checked out this episode of the #askgaryvee show. 17. the last podcast you should listen to in 2017 even though we’re nearly at the point of entering 2019, this podcast is extremely important. i want to drive you to all become self-aware, find out what makes you happy, and what will drive you to become successful on your own terms. self-awareness is by far the pillar concept that i push in this podcast, but it’s also one that is timeless. so, regardless, if you’re reading this in 2017, 2018, or even 2050, i would highly encourage you to check out this episode of my podcast because it could be the one piece of content that you need to hear to start living a happier and more successful life. 18. my honest opinion on hard work, hustle, rest, & sleep this podcast is crucial for anyone who thinks that i preach the idea of not sleeping, having no social life, or working just for the sake of working. if you’re truly doing what you love, it won’t feel like you’re actually working… even though i talk a lot about hard work and hustle, i still take some time off on the weekends to spend with my family, watch jets games, and rest. just because i put so much emphasis on working hard doesn’t mean that i’m remotely trying to say that you shouldn’t be sleeping or not resting… i’m trying to say that you should be using the time that you have while awake wisely and productively. 19. #askgaryvee special small business edition i’m really pumped that i got to team up with chase, a vaynermedia client, and create this episode of the #askgaryvee show in honor of small business week. i absolutely loved getting to sit down with brian reinhard, marketing and product executive at chase business banking, and speak to the 3 different small business owners about things that could help them take their business to the next level. if you’re a small business owner and looking for insight on what you can be doing to scale, this episode is for you 😉 20. why becoming a practitioner is so important have you ever been curious as to why i’ve decided to spend so much time creating content on a daily basis across multiple platforms? it’s all in an effort to be a practitioner of my craft. i see so many people selling services, giving advice, or even forming opinions on things that they’ve never actually experienced or tested. if you want to be a master of your craft and really be the best, you need to listen to this episode of the podcast to find out how you can get there. i’m really looking forward to bringing more fire content to my podcast updated daily which is available on all major platforms including itunes, spotify, soundcloud, sticher, google play & more. it’s the platform i have been preaching for the last 12-24 months and i feel like i am just getting started when i think about delivering the most value to all of my listeners old and new. if you haven’t tuned in, i think the podcast delivers the most for those commuting or consuming at work and on the go. i hope you enjoy and it saves you time. leave a comment or a review on itunes to tell me which episodes brought value and how i can improve. i would really appreciate your $0.02 thanks for listening ❤️ i am wishing u all the best 2018 please say hello on: instagram | facebook | twitter | snapchat subscribe to my newsletter here share #podcast check this out #business share how to make 64 pieces of content in a day 4 months ago · 2 min read in my continued efforts to bring the most value to the entrepreneurs, operators, and marketers of the world, today on my 44th birthday, i’m releasing a deck that the team and i have worked on extensively over the last couple of months. ... read more >> subscribe for access to exclusive content. lorem ipsum dolor test× subscribe must read the rise of audio branding feb 03, 2019 read now >> must read the top 20 podcasts from the garyvee audio experience sep 21, 2018 read now >> upcoming events may 05 integrity events presents – gary vaynerchuk london, uk info may 05 the sasha group’s digital discovery+ deep dive london, uk info may 07 social media week new york new york, ny info jun 12 e2 summit park city, ut info get notifications × × gary vaynerchuk home blog podcast events garyvee search engine recent press books hire me to speak my story press kit first time here wallpapers keep in touch lorem ipsum dolor test× get all my best stuff in your inbox. subscribe ©gary vee ip, llc 2018 privacy policy | terms of use × ×
