skip to content the virtual stoa a weblog eulogy for henry brooke (1936-2018) henry brooke died on 30 january 2018. his funeral was held at st luke’s, chelsea, on 20 february. this is the text of the address that was delivered on that occasion by his son christopher and subsequently published in the inner temple yearbook [pdf]. henry “labour[ed] night and day”, as we’ve just been singing. he didn’t work hard because he had to–and we know that because he went on working for more a decade after he “retired” (with “retired” in inverted commas). he didn’t work to get away from his family, because he liked them, and they liked him–more on this a little later. i don’t think he was motivated primarily by guilt, either, relating to the privileged life that he led. and he wasn’t really working as a way of distracting himself from the anxieties we all have from time to time about whether anything means anything at all. karl marx–who once lived a few minutes’ walk from here, on anderson street–says that when we work on our own projects (these are his words), “the result is the self-realization and objectification of the subject, therefore real freedom, whose activity is precisely labour”. continue reading “eulogy for henry brooke (1936-2018)” author christopherbrookeposted on february 21, 2018march 2, 2019categories friends and family3 comments on eulogy for henry brooke (1936-2018) doctors in the house, again one of the less-remarked on aspects of the 2017 general election is that it made my post, below, about mps with phds out of date. of the old guard, john pugh (lib dem) stood down in southport, and both of the snp phds lost their seats–paul monaghan in caithness, sutherland & easter ross, and eilidh whiteford in banff & buchan. and tristram hunt (labour) had earlier quit his seat in stoke-on-trent central, of course. i’ve now scratched around with the new boys and girls, and here is some fresh information about the more academic end of the new house of commons–as before, a pleasingly all-party affair. three new doctorates have come to light: continue reading “doctors in the house, again” author christopherbrookeposted on august 17, 2017march 3, 2019categories academics, british politics1 comment on doctors in the house, again doctors in the house so last night, on a whim, i started collecting links to doctoral dissertations written by members of the house of commons, and posting them on the twitter. with some assistance from the hivemind, i found a dozen then, and eight more this morning [update: and then another came to light in the evening]. here they all are, for ease of reference, in alphabetical order, in many cases with more stable links than i managed to post before.

[this is page four, continued from pages three, two and one.] quite apart from the quantitative aspect, have the refugees who wish to stay here proved an asset or a liability? on the basis of the evidence which will be discussed in these pages, there is only one conclusion it is possible to draw. by and large refugees have proved a valuable element in our society: they have made contributions to our national life in industry, in the universities, in the arts and in the world of science. during the war they have acquitted themselves well. continue reading “what have been the effects?” author christopherbrookeposted on september 2, 2015march 3, 2019categories british politics, life in britain, serialsleave a comment on what have been the effects? how many will be left after the war? [this is page three, continued from page two and one.] we do not, of course, know precisely how many further arrivals there will be. but the foreign secretary, in his report on the 1943 bermuda conference on refugee questions between the british and the united states governments, stated that great britain was continuing to admit about 800 non-british war refugees every month. these, like most of the war refugees, w ill, for the most part, stay in this country only to fight. “nearly all are admitted because they are wanted for the armed forces or the merchant service of ourselves or our allies. nearly all of them are people who would be repatriated after the war.”[6] continue reading “how many will be left after the war?” author christopherbrookeposted on september 2, 2015march 3, 2019categories british politics, life in britain, serialsleave a comment on how many will be left after the war? how many were admitted? [this is page two, continued from page one.] immigration into britain was practically unrestricted during the whole of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century; at that time the average level of unemployment was low. but after the last war unemployment became more pronounced: this is the fundamental fact which coloured the whole of british official policy towards aliens in the last three decades. continue reading “how many were admitted?” author christopherbrookeposted on september 2, 2015march 3, 2019categories british politics, life in britain, serialsleave a comment on how many were admitted? summary / are refugees an asset? summary the object of the pamphlet is to answer the question, “should the refugees who wish to stay in britain after the war be allowed to do so?” the fear of aggravating british unemployment was at the root of the government’s unwillingness to admit more refugees before the war. at its outbreak there were not more than 90,000 refugees in britain; 73,000 of these were from germany or austria, and most of these were jewish. emigration and death has now reduced the number of germans and austrians to less than 50,000. about 75,000 allied nationals have been admitted during the war. relatively few of them wish to stay permanently in britain. only about 40,000 refugees will want to become permanent residents; about 80 per cent. of these are former german and austrian nationals. britain’s population is bound to fall. emigration to the dominions would enhance the decline. encouraging refugees to remain would help in small measure to offset british emigration. during the war most refugees have found employment. they have contributed to the war effort. refugees have developed new industries in britain, in peace-time they created additional employment and assisted british exports. refugee scholars and artists have enriched britain’s cultural life. refugee scientists have cooperated in the advance of war-time science. the record of the refugees before and during the war suggests, in short, that they have been an asset to britain. the services they are able to render should be no less valuable after the war. if we in britain want refugees to stay they should be granted equality of rights with british subjects. those eligible for naturalisation should be granted citizenship. continue reading “summary / are refugees an asset?” author christopherbrookeposted on september 2, 2015march 3, 2019categories british politics, life in britain, serialsleave a comment on summary / are refugees an asset? are refugees an asset? i’m republishing on this blog the text of an anonymous pamphlet that was published by pep (political and economic planning) in september 1944, during an earlier public debate about the fate of refugees and the united kingdom. i’ve stuck this up on the web before, on older incarnations of this website, and now i’m going to stick it up again. i’m reproducing the text unabridged from the original pamphlet across five blogposts (not including this one), following the major divisions in the text; the only significant change i’ve made is that i’ve placed the “summary” at the start, rather than at the end of the pamphlet, to serve as an introduction to new readers. summary / are refugees an asset? how many were admitted? how many will be left after the war? what have been the effects? refugees in post-war britain author christopherbrookeposted on september 2, 2015categories british politics, life in britain, serialsleave a comment on are refugees an asset? buckingham: from the palace to the parliamentary constituency so on the one hand, the tories really don’t like john bercow, the speaker of the house of commons. and on the other hand, the hilarious letters prince charles used to write to ministers are finally going to be made public (full judgment here [pdf]), raising a question-mark over how he might try to shape public and ministerial opinion in the future in support of his various idiosyncratic and reactionary agendas. a solution presents itself. john bercow will stand for re-election in buckingham as speaker, and the three major parties will not stand against him, as is customary. (there’ll be a ukipper and a green–and this is where farage stood last time, of course.) so what the tories will be looking for is a way of running a candidate against him who is (i) officially an independent, but in practice a tory, and who (ii) might actually win the seat. well, there’s jeremy clarkson, of course, who lives not so far away in chipping norton, and is looking for something new to do. he probably isn’t interested. but there’s also hrh the prince of wales. is the prince eligible to stand for election to the house of commons? i think he is. he is a peer, but he’s no longer a voting member of the house of lords, which seems to be the key eligibility criterion. (there’s a quick guide to the question here [pdf], which refers you on to the 1975 house of commons disqualification act, of which i haven’t read every word, but at a glance can’t see the bit that says no royals.) and were he to be elected to the commons, no-one could ever complain that he was exercising illegitimate influence by writing eccentric letters to ministers as often as he chose. he’d even have the benefit of parliamentary privilege, if he wanted to slag off his enemies beyond the reach of the libel law. and the constituency work would give him something useful to do, while he continues to wait for his mother to die. author christopherbrookeposted on march 27, 2015categories british politics, royals, toriesleave a comment on buckingham: from the palace to the parliamentary constituency posts navigation page 1 page 2 … page 229 next page search for: search recent posts eulogy for henry brooke (1936-2018) doctors in the house, again doctors in the house refugees in post-war britain what have been the effects? how many will be left after the war? how many were admitted? summary / are refugees an asset? are refugees an asset? buckingham: from the palace to the parliamentary constituency recent comments skip worden on patrick riley (1941-2015) john o’brien on let him go, let him tarry frank neary on a short history of swivel-eyed loons annie creswick dawson on ruskin on penguins what’s in a name? mps and their preferred titles. – andrew gray on doctors in the house matthew farrauto on patrick riley (1941-2015) paul stevenson on doctors in the house, again chrisbrooke on eulogy for henry brooke (1936-2018) jane gerson on eulogy for henry brooke (1936-2018) keith hollis on eulogy for henry brooke (1936-2018) archives february 2018 august 2017 august 2016 september 2015 march 2015 february 2015 august 2014 july 2014 february 2014 december 2013 october 2013 august 2013 may 2013 january 2013 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 march 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 september 2011 august 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 may 2010 april 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 june 2004 may 2004 april 2004 march 2004 february 2004 january 2004 december 2003 november 2003 october 2003 september 2003 august 2003 july 2003 may 2003 april 2003 march 2003 february 2003 january 2003 december 2002 november 2002 october 2002 september 2002 august 2002 july 2002 may 2002 april 2002 march 2002 february 2002 january 2002 december 2001 november 2001 october 2001 september 2001 june 2001 may 2001 categories academics africana americana animals baseball beavers blog silliness books booze british politics c17 c18 c19 cambridge camelids central europe cheloniana cricket culture cycling dsw elephants europe far right films football france frc friends and family goats idiots ireland italy jericho latin leftwingery lego lfw life in britain link mayday media middle east mmb music newspapers oxford planet melanie pollardiana radio religion royals rugby serials sex and gender splendid / rubbish / nonsense sport tcw television tkb / tcb tories war on terror world of blogs meta log in entries feed comments feed wordpress.org the virtual stoa proudly powered by wordpress
