there are various factors that influence academic performance of a student: parents, social environment, the educational system and so on. what is also vital to highlight in regards to academic performance and behavior is that studying methods and techniques play a role as well. in other words, a student will require academic writing help more often in case they have not developed the studying habits. another reason why so many students resort to searching for a high-quality academic writing service is the inability to comprehend the task and come up with a study plan to deal with that assignment. evaluation methods grades are the most common way to evaluate the knowledge a student has managed to acquire during the term. even though there is a heated debate in regards to whether grades actually help to boost academic performance or contribute to the lack of motivation, they still remain to be the most effective means of rating control in educational institutions. if students’ grades are low, both their teachers and students’ themselves realize that something needs to be done. perhaps, it is time to look for help with academic writing or get a tutor. what is important to keep in mind in regards to rating and academic evaluation is that a student will be motivated to study better when they get a reward. getting a good grade is a reward for all the hard work they have put into the studying process. getting a low grade signifies that it is time to find academic writing help to improve their grades. if one manages to come across somebody who provides high-quality help with academic writing which, in its turn, helps a student improve their academic performance, it can be classified as a reward as well. benefits of assessment one of the main reasons why it is important to keep at least one form of academic assessment at educational institutions is that it helps students understand how they can improve; what they are currently doing wrong, as well as which steps to take in case they require academic writing help. surely, addressing one’s request to an academic writing service, such as academicexperts.com is rather common as well. in our case, it is vital to understand why so many students choose to get help with academic writing from an online academic writing service. the most obvious explanation is the desire to improve one’s academic performance in the fastest way possible. what is important to keep in mind is that it is vital for the faculty to constantly come up with ideas on how to reform the evaluation process. besides, the main goal is to make sure every single student is satisfied with the outcome. in other words, students need to know why they are required to do great at college, as well as comprehend what the grade they receive for a certain task stands for. conclusion taking everything into consideration, grades remain to be one of the most effective means of rating control in educational institutions. however, it does not mean that there is no need to introduce new evaluation methods. the latter will students better understand how to improve their academic performance. what is more, getting rid of grades or any other form of rating will not be helpful as students need some sort of metrics to be able to see what aspects they need to improve to perform better academically. grades and test scores as a means of measuring academic performance have been heavily criticized in recent years because a lot of students tend to care more about the grade rather than about acquiring actual knowledge they will need as soon as they start working at their first job. for this reason, it is vital to remind students that the grade they get has nothing to do with who’s doing better in class and who’s doing worse. it is merely a representation of their academic situation at that moment which should motivate them to do more in case they are not satisfied with the grade they have received. first name email address: leave this field empty if you're human: (visited 35 times, 1 visits today) comments comments grades school in school on december 3, 2019 december 3, 2019 share this previous post← four inexpensive and fast ways to enhance your backyard four inexpensive and fast ways to enhance your backyard next posthow we can teach our kids to experience holidays mindfully → how we can teach our kids to experience holidays mindfully you may also like on january 9, 2020 professors from the university of washington know how to motivate applicants to enter the most demanding colleges on september 11, 2018 when your kid wants to build a real robot, what do you do?
