elite daily acalu studio these are the snapchat travelers to live vicariously through by kaylin pound march 1, 2016 if there's one thing we all love, it's hearing stories about people who ditch their boring, old day jobs to travel the world. we tend to romanticize the thought of finding ourselves while getting lost in cities across every continent. yep, when it comes to being spontaneous, lots of millennials have the mentality it's nbd to drop everything, pack a bag and go. but unfortunately, not all of us have the balls to completely ditch our 9-5 jobs and say "sayonara" to our friends and fam for the uncertainty that comes with traveling the world. if you happen to have a serious case of wanderlust but don't have the time or means to get your foreign fix, don't worry. just because you can't see new places firsthand doesn't mean you have to miss out on all the fun. we live in a world that is more connected than ever and, thanks to social media apps like snapchat, you can vicariously live out all of your travel fantasies by tagging along on other people's journeys around the globe! like most things in life, not all snapchat stories are created equal. so we rounded up some of our favorite snapchat travelers to show you their amazing stories. these snapchatters will make you feel like you're right in the middle of the action until you can finally go out and explore the world on your own! take a look at the photos below and check out these travelers out on snapchat. kiersten rich - @theblondeabroad alyssa ramos - @mylifesamovie drew goldberg - @drewbinsky kristin addis - @krislikewhaat expat edna - @expatedna lee abbamonte - @leeabbamonte hannah and adam - @gettingstamped matthew karsten - @expertvagabond news experiences style entertainment dating health women's history month video aboutcontactnewslettertermsprivacy
