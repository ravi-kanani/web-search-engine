skip to content style bubble bubbling up since 2006 posted on 2013-12-11 by susie this is me‚Ä¶ bidding farewell to n7 you will see that bloody balcony no more. the outfit posts on the communal terrace will cease to exist. and, i have lost a very convenient venue to hold our blogger year sales. just in case you‚Äôre in the miniscule minority who doesn‚Äôt know (i have pretty much been yapping on about this to anybody who has hearing), i am finally getting out of my n7 hovel on saturday and i have been busy getting my new house (extreme and far out location to be revealed soon‚Ä¶) ready in preparation. i still have not got a toilet but i do have lovely new cushions by swash. i know my priorities. before i look forward to the new and slightly bigger hovel (it‚Äôs a house w/ a real staircase ‚Äì beyond excited!) i thought i‚Äôd take a moment to say farewell to my beloved n7. if i could afford you, i would have stayed. i love your dogged un-trendiness although i spy that two ‚Äúartisinal‚Äù coffee shops have popped up on holloway road ‚Äì maybe that‚Äôs a sign for me to get out. i love your proximity to two useful tube lines and your all round convenience for everything. i will miss the following in no particular order ‚Äì le peche mignon‚Äôs real-deal french owners and their dedication to their perfect croissaints, the awesome peeps at chip inn fish bar who always give me extra chips, the slightly eccentric owner of ooh la la furniture store, the cantankerous lady at 162 vintage store, bibimbap at busan (secret-not-so-secret korean spot), the lady at holloway road tube station newsagents who senses i am in a rush and hands over my change in speedy time, the roars of goals when arsenal are playing and the smell of burgers/sausages outside our building on matchdays, the guy who sells arsenal merchandise who makes fun of my outfits and always asks ‚Äúare you a designer?‚Äù even though i tell him every time that i‚Äôm not. i‚Äôm belatedly blogging this little film made in association with opsh and kanken bags as part of their ‚Äúthis is me‚Äù series, profiling british creativies, where they live, how they work and passions outside of their vocation, with mine being food and football. i‚Äôll look back on this film perhaps and wonder why it is i moved. maybe i‚Äôll come back. maybe i won‚Äôt. regardless, n7 has been grand to me for the past six years. there‚Äôll be a pensive pause for sure when i load up the last bits on to the moving van on saturday. film-maker: geppetto, photography: rich gilligan, produced by: prowlster, executive producers: skookum ltd categoriesfilm, news 33 replies to ‚Äúthis is me‚Ä¶ bidding farewell to n7‚Äù sweet perdition says: 2013-12-11 at 4:39 pm un video genial!! http://sweet-perdition.blogspot.com.es/ reply paola says: 2013-12-11 at 4:49 pm love the shoes you are wearing! where did u get them! i have been looking for something in that colour for ages! thanks, p. reply pourquoi moi?

we upgraded from a flat to a house a couple of years ago and it meant moving away from one of my favourite areas of bristol which still stings a little, but trust me when i say the staircase will be worth it üôÇ reply bollywood sarees says: 2013-12-13 at 9:08 am love your pink bag and your hairstyle is so nice üôÇ keep it up check out bollywood sarees online a real indian fashion reply isida says: 2013-12-13 at 9:23 am love your dorothy shoes!! http://isidahorncastle.blogspot.com/ reply natalia aka littlerus says: 2013-12-13 at 1:56 pm it always feels a little sad to pack ones life in boxes and take it to a completely new destination (even if it does include acquiring a real staircase in the process). hope the move goes well and the new home feels super welcoming and warm! x reply kaye beeh says: 2013-12-16 at 1:08 am artisanal places popping up means gentrification of an area. rent becomes unaffordable but im excited for your new place. i know change is alot but hey, with change comes some form of power so lets what you do with your new place! xoxx. much love. reply cococozy says: 2013-12-16 at 11:35 pm good luck with the move! xo coco reply 3girls1apple says: 2013-12-19 at 5:59 pm good luck with the move! change is always exciting! xoxo 3girls1apple.com reply el armario de la nena says: 2013-12-20 at 4:16 pm gorgeous! i really love your great style, it¬¥s so original and chic! reply danielle says: 2013-12-22 at 7:33 pm great outfit and love your style! http://www.sohostyles.blogspot.nl reply kate says: 2013-12-25 at 2:33 am i love your style! reply shabana says: 2013-12-29 at 6:13 pm goodluck! i moved few months back and within days moved back! hahaa lovely blog you have! new follower üôÇ http://shabanasultana.blogspot.com reply greta gale says: 2014-01-05 at 2:34 am congrats on the move! hope it all goes well x greta flourish-blog.blogspot.com reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website post navigation previous postprevious when in rome‚Ä¶ next postnext a different sort of move categories categories select category accessories art beautiful people beauty books designers diy editorials film history london music new buys news random rants and raves shoes shop watch shopping streetstyle susie styles television travel trends uncategorized vintage archives archives select month june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 january 2018 december 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 march 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 proudly powered by wordpress
