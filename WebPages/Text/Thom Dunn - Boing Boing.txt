"wuhan virus", "chinese virus", covid-19. doesn't matter the name - my hometown will forever be known for that and only that. i drew this comic to shine light on what people don't know: the beautiful culture, rich history, and strong people of wuhan.

(i'd also love to see the look on that scuba instructor's face if/when they realized that the old man they were scolding was in fact buzz aldrin.) now, aldrin is 90 years old, which puts him at particularly high risk for infection by the novel coronavirus. but this national treasure has a solid plan to stay safe, as detailed to eric berger at ars technica: "lying on my ass and locking the door." aldrin is a survivor ‚Äî of outer space, of shitty jobs, and of alcoholism and depression ‚Äî so i tend to trust his advice. but if you're looking for something more substantial, forbes spoke with several other astronauts about their time in isolation, including nasa‚Äôs human research program director bill paloski, ph.d.; john grunsfeld phd, a retired nasa astronaut and hubble space telescope repairman who spent over 59 days in space; and dr. read the rest share / tweet / 3 comments astronaut / astronauts / buzz aldrin / international space station / isolation / nasa / quarantine / social isolation thom dunn / 3:21 pm fri, mar 20, 2020 "metropolis kid" will make you dance like superboy metropolis kid by model decoy i've known doron monk flake and ari sadowitz since high school, and it's been an honor to watch their musical prowess grow and grow and grow. their current project, model decoy, pumps out prince-like post-punk jams, full of sick rock riffs and soaring jazzy vocals that bring gravitas to clever lyrics that are mostly about their favorite nerdy comic books and movies. their newest single, "metropolis kid," is a perfect example of this. it makes you want to tap your feet as you croon along with superboy (being young kon-el, the misfit clone of superman and lex luthor, not that cranky bastard superboy-prime you can find the band's back catalog on spotify, but they just released "metropolis kid" and two other new songs exclusively on bandcamp, which is waiving their fee today (march 20) so that struggling bands can get 100% of the proceeds of their music during this quarantine. (if you're feeling generous, you can buy some tunes from my own band, the roland high life, too ‚Äî we're not as funky as model decoy, but we do have some good banger about spider-man and, uhh,

twitter page, warning residents about a rogue heffer who had been let loose upon their quiet community. this female brown cow with a white head was renowned for her speed and fence-jumping skills, and also apparently liked pools. for several months a loose cow has been seen wandering in the area of sheridan & i-75. it has evaded capture by both our officers & assisting cow herders since january. if

thom dunn / 4:42 pm tue, mar 17, 2020 the entire animorphs book series is now available for free online animorphs was a ya sci-fi series that took the mid-90s scholastic book fair circuit by storm. written by k.a. applegate, the books focus on a group of kids who gain the ability to transform into any animal they touch ‚Äî but only for two hours, or else they're stuck that way. naturally, they meet and befriend an alien named aximili-esgarrouth-isthill (or "ax" for short) who also has this same ability, and recruits them to join his guerilla resistance efforts to stop an invasion by a race of slug-like alien parasites who can crawl into peoples' ears and take over their brains. wikipedia informs me that there were 54 books in total in this series, although the latter half was ghostwritten, as tends to happen with these sorts of things. they all sported the same uncanny-valley-bad-90s-cgi-cover art of someone morphing into an animal. i remember being pretty obsessed with the series as a kid, and their quarterly-or-so release schedule was a great way to satisfy my voracity for reading. i don't know how well they actually hold up, but even the paris review recently sang their nostalgic praises. and, well, kids fighting against an evil fascist empire that's essentially invisible other than the fact that it hijacks the brains of parents and authority figures is, erm, still a pretty relevant concept. i also hear they dealt pretty well with trauma and complicated moral questions, which i vaguely recall as well. i definitely remember the body horror and food horror and surprising amount of death and violence for a kids' book. read the rest share / tweet / 9 comments 90s nostalgia / animorphs / book fair / scholastic / sci fi / ya literature thom dunn / 4:42 pm

[‚Ä¶] but it‚Äôs also worth asking if we are willing to allow governments and corporations to return to business as usual. when everything‚Äôs back to normal, will we accept cities cutting off their poorest residents‚Äô water, or evicting the sick, or throwing someone in jail because they can‚Äôt afford to pay a fine? read the rest share / tweet / 11 comments bullshit policies / coronavirus / covid-19 / prison reform / rules schmules / security theatre / that is the policy / tsa more posts read the rules you agree to by using this website in our terms of service. we are a participant in the amazon services llc associates program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to amazon.com and affiliated sites. boing boing uses cookies and analytics trackers, and is supported by advertising, merchandise sales and affiliate links. read about what we do with the data we gather in our privacy policy. who will be eaten first? our forum rules are detailed in the community guidelines. boing boing is published under a creative commons license except where otherwise noted. mark frauenfelder david pescovitz xeni jardin rob beschizza carla sinclair editors jason weisberger publisher ken snider sysadmin about us contact us advertise forums shop report a bad ad shop support
