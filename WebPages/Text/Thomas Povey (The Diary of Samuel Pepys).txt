it seems to have been settled out of court.[6] povey family interests in the english caribbean were extensive: thomas's brother richard povey looked after the family interests in jamaica, where he was officially commissioner general for provisions, while another brother, william, attended to affairs in barbados, where he was officially provost-general.[7] povey was one of the original members of the royal society in may 1663 and had acted in the interests of its less formalised predecessor at gresham college. povey proposed samuel pepys for membership, 8 february 1665.[8] john evelyn, a fellow member of the royal society, found povey "a nice contriver of all elegancies and exceedingly formal". as a fellow, povey offered the royal society a dissertation in 1693 on the manufacture of brass.[9] povey presented a report on louis xiv's hôtel des invalides,[10] which charles ii emulated in the royal hospital chelsea, under a royal warrant of 22 december 1681. povey had apartments in whitehall palace by virtue of his crown posts. robert streater painted a ceiling in povey's london house, on the west side of lincoln's inn fields; there john evelyn visited him in july 1664: went to see mr povey's elegant house in lincolns-inn-fields , where the perspective in his court, painted by streater, is indeed excellent, with the vases painted in imitation of porphy and fountains...[11] pepys noted with approval povey's neatly fitted up stables, lined with washable delft tiles.[12] povey also inherited from his father hounslow priory, situated in a suburban village west of london; it was sold in 1671, and by the end of the 18th century only the chapel remained.[13] he donated to the royal society the portrait that he asserted was of the historian george buchanan and by titian.[14] in his court appointment as master of requests, 1675–85, he received petitions and presented them for consideration by the privy council. povey advanced the early career of his nephew william blathwayt, and it is surely due to his influence that his son-in-law giles bland was sent to virginia as customs collector.[15] some of the paintings from povey's collection, which hung in his london house or at hounslow, remain in blathwayt's house, dyrham park, gloucestershire. povey's letter books are conserved in the british library.[16] family he married mary, daughter of john adderly and widow of john agard of king's bromley, staffordshire. his daughter sarah married another member of the staffordshire gentry, robert leveson of wolverhampton and had three sons, including the soldier and politician richard leveson. another daughter sarah married giles bland, who was executed for treason in virginia in 1677, having played a leading part in bacon's rebellion the previous year. notes ^ povey was one of the four eminent london merchants— the others being martin noell, sir nicholas crispe and sir andrew riccard— among the courtiers on the board, whose restrictions on colonial trade were resisted from the first by virginia planters (joan de lourdes leonard, "operation checkmate: the birth and death of a virginia blueprint for progress 1660–1676", the william and mary quarterly, third series, 24.1 (january 1967:44–74). ^ lillian m. penson, the colonial agents of the british west indies: a study in colonial administration, mainly in the eighteenth century, 1924: s.s. webb, "william blathwayt, imperial fixer: from popish plot to glorious revolution", the william and mary quarterly 1968. ^ herbert l. osgood, the american colonies in the seventeenth century, vol. iii:145f. ^ pepys found him a "wretched accountant". ^ "thomas povey", the diary of samuel pepys, 1893 text ^ eleanore boswell, "footnotes to seventeenth-century biographies. samuel pepys" the modern language review 26.2 (april 1931:176–178). ^ bernard bailyn, "communications and trade: the atlantic in the seventeenth century", journal of economic history, 1953. ^ norman j.w. thrower, "samuel pepys frs (1633–1703) and the royal society" notes and records of the royal society of london 57.1 (january 2003:3–13) p. 6. ^ povey, "the method, manner and order of the transmutation of copper into brass, etc. by thomas povey, esq;

povy maintained that it had been forgotten. painting "hath been the study, delight and ornament of all ages and nations where peace or a civility has not been abandoned.'' he suggested a volume that combined history with practice, to look at artists' "several ways of working, the degrees of improvement of this art, and the rarity of their colours." he suggested that lesser arts such as bronzing, staining, engraving and etching could be combined as an appendix. ✹ pedro on 28 jul 2007 • link the above information from darley's biography of evelyn. ✹ pedro on 28 jul 2007 • link correction to the above source it should read... consuming splendor by linda levy peck. ✹ cgs on 10 feb 2008 • link from parliament : auditor povey, a protection. ordered, that mr. auditor povey shall have the protection of this house, for the securing his goods and horses at hounsloe, he keeping one of them for a light horse;

and it is this. you may, i doubt not, have heard that one james, who had sometimes been my servant, has been made use of as my accuser. he is now upon his sickbed, and, as i am told, near the point of death, and has declared himself inclined to ease his conscience of something wherein i may be nearly concerned, with a particular willingness to open himself to you, whom he says he has known and observed during his serving the duke of buckingham and me. you may please, therefore in charity to me as well as to the dying man, to give him a visit tomorrow morning, when i shall appoint one to conduct you to his lodging. it may be you may hesitate herein, because of the friendship which i no less know you to have with mister harbord than you know him to have of ill will against me, and of the effects of it under which i still remain, of being held obnoxious to others, to whom you bear great reverence. but that makes me rather to importune you to the taking this trouble upon you, because your candour is such, that, with a fair and equal indifferency, you will hear and represent what that dying man shall relate to you, who, it is likely, will reveal nothing at this hour but truth; and it is truth only, and the god thereof, to which i appeal, and which will, i hope, vindicate my reputation, and free me from the misunderstandings which i find many ingenuous and worthy persons have had of me, from their being seduced by the false testimonies which have engained and improved to my disadvantage, even to the hazard of my life and estate, and no less to the disturbing of the government, than to the raising injurious reflections upon those public trust in which i have (much to your knowledge) carried myself diligently, and (i am sure) faithfully. and in this i the rather take the liberty of opening myself thus freely and amply to you upon this occasion, because i would move you the more strongly, to take upon you this just and charitable office, so much importing others, as well as your most humble servant s.pepys james died march 20, 1680 ✹ robert harneis 2 days ago • link • flag this is a the letter he sent to his father after james died letting him know how it all turned out - and indirectly how he was back in favour with the king. ✹ robert harneis on 17 feb 2018 • link s.pepys to john pepys (sam’s father) march 27th 1680, york buildings sir, it is long since i have expressed my duty to you, and truly everyday has followed one another with some new occasion of care, so as that, though i have been in a great measure restored to the liberty of my person, my mind has continued still in thralldom, till now that it has pleased god, in a miraculous manner, to begin the work of my vindication by laying his hand upon james my butler, by a sickness whereof he is some days since dead, which led him to consider and repent the wrongs he had done me in accusing me in parliament, which he has solemnly and publicly confessed upon the holy sacrament to the justifying of me and my family to all the world in that part of my accusation which relates to religion; and i question not but god almighty will be no less just to me in what concerns the rest of my charge, which he knows to be no less false than this. in the meantime his holy name be praised for what he has done in this particular. what i have to add is the letting you know that i am commanded to attend the king the next week at newmarket, and, by the grace of god, will go and wait on you one day in my going or return, which i presume will be either tuesday or saturday next, i designing to set forth hence on monday and shall rather choose to call upon you in my going (which will be on tuesday), for fear lest i should be commanded to accompany the court to london, where the king designs to be this day seven nights. in the meantime trusting in god to find you in good health, and with my most humble duty presented to yourself, and my kind love to my brother and sister, and their family, i remain sir, your ever obedient son, s. p. log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1662 aug 23 oct 22 27 dec 24 31 1663 jan 19 22 24 26 feb 1 2 6 12 mar 6 30 jul 24 aug 10 11 sep 4 13 oct 19 nov 22 1664 jan 11 21 25 feb 10 26 mar 3 26 28 31 apr 14 16 19 29 may 3 4 20 21 29 jun 22 jul 8 12 14 18 27 sep 8 12 14 18 21 nov 24 28 dec 5 6 7 9 17 1665 jan 16 17 18 19 21 27 29 31 feb 2 3 8 15 16 17 mar 17 18 19 20 21 22 24 26 27 29 31 apr 2 7 8 10 12 14 19 20 21 23 24 26 28 may 1 5 10 12 16 17 23 24 27 jun 1 8 17 18 23 24 26 jul 1 7 10 14 21 aug 7 20 sep 6 7 oct 15 16 1666 jan 5 9 19 feb 21 mar 14 16 27 may 23 jun 9 jul 3 31 aug 14 29 oct 13 15 19 20 22 27 1667 jan 31 feb 11 20 mar 25 may 14 jun 24 26 27 jul 29 sep 10 12 dec 27 1668 jan 27 jun 18 19 20 oct 30 nov 1 2 5 6 16 18 21 23 27 30 1669 jan 13 15 16 20 feb 1 4 10 15 mar 4 21 apr 15 may 3 10 latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
