this will take some time away from immediate issues to develop thoughts upon. i’ll be sharing them here as they emerge, i promise you, this meaning thew general agreement on the future that no one else is involved in creating nor even aware of, rather tablets pressed and stamped from an end terrace in ely? <a

ritchie 6 comments in this context, “michael” in ireland raised a pertinent question: “do you think that it is possible (technically) for governments to tap into the trillions which are hidden offshore?” to which the answer is: yes, plenty of it. there’s some $8-35 trillion or so sitting offshore, depending on how broadly this is measured, which can certainly be tapped with stronger political will. and we must never forget that while all countries are victims of offshore chicanery, lower-income countries are the worst hit, as dictators and oligarchs loot national treasuries and sew up their economies into private fiefdoms, then transfer their ill-gotten gains overseas and stash it offshore. greater transparency would mean that the dictators would know where their own subjects have hidden the stuff so it can be nicked, right? we can thank the eu for this one march 27, 2020 by tim worstall your tax money at work 37 comments unwrapped a new laptop, updated the

could obviously be wrong – that the fda’s definition of “safe and effective” uses “effective” to mean as good as or better than whatever other drugs there are already approved to treat the same condition. is that true? specifically, i’m interested in 1) effective means does what it says on the tin or, to distinguish 2) does what it says on the tin better than extant preparations or 3) does what it says on the tin as well as or better than current preparations. <a href='http://secure.echion.co.uk/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a39438cf&amp;cb=insert_random_number_here' target='_blank'><img

ragging on ritchie 11 comments i whacked, again, tonight so i have little energy left to cover the secrete for the self-employed tonight. it’s just that the secrete matches the verb in an odd sort of manner. higher inflation, yes march 27, 2020 by tim worstall finance 9 comments but as oliver kamm refuses to recognise it’s possible to have too much of a good thing: higher inflation, of say 5 to 10 per cent, will also make it easier to deal with the (necessary) widening of the budget deficit. gradually, nominal interest rates will rise. 10%? man’s mad we’re all really, really, surprised, right? march 27, 2020 by tim worstall celebrities 20 comments overnight last friday, following an agreement between justin trudeau, the canadian prime minister, and president trump, the world’s longest border closed. the sussexes are said to have fled to meghan’s home city at the eleventh hour. “they realised canada would not work out for various reasons and they want to be based in the los angeles area,” the source told the sun. reports suggest that they will search for a house in hollywood, dunno quite how it will work out for the career but being an actual, real, live, duchess is a pretty good solution to the problems of being a middling and soon to be middle aged actress. protect the nhs march 27, 2020 by tim worstall your tax money at work 32 comments yes, yes, obviously, i know what the slogan is about. refrain from getting infected so that the nhs isn’t overloaded. and yet there’s still something more than a little jarring about it. for it can also be read as the nhs is some joyous creation of our civilisation that must be cared for, saved from harm, even at the expense of other things like life and, well, civilisation. that is, it’s being reified rather than treated as what it is, something we’ve created to do stuff for us. and, you know, if it doesn’t do stuff for us well or efficiently then it should be changed, replaced or abandoned. exactly the things that a goodly portion of the political commentariat will never allow to happen. <a href='http://secure.echion.co.uk/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a39438cf&amp;cb=insert_random_number_here' target='_blank'><img

2020 by tim worstall celebrities 8 comments the duchess of sussex is to narrate a disney film which documents the journey of a family of elephants across the kalahari desert in southern africa, which will launch three days after she and prince harry “step back” from being senior royals. meghan will voice the disneynature documentary elephant, which will be available on disney+ from 3 april, and is her first major acting role since becoming a royal. voiceovers for a disney documentary (they only ever pay scale, no premium for fame at all) are the sort of wage slavery you yearn to escape from by becoming a princess…… no it wasn’t march 27, 2020 by tim worstall business 4 comments the housing market was halted on thursday night by the government after financial institutions said they could no longer operate properly. ministers are discouraging buyers from going ahead with house sales and purchases unless they have already exchanged contracts as part of wider efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus, saying no one should move unless absolutely necessary. the effect of the government saying “we strongly advise you not to do it” might well be to slow the housing market down to a near halt. but it’s still not true that the government has halted it. we didn’t actually elect ritchie you know. not wholly and not quite march 27, 2020march 27, 2020 by tim worstall military 2

2020march 26, 2020 by tim worstall newspaper watch 47 comments this national lockdown has met with the approval of the vast majority of the voting public, at least for now: when it comes down to it, we are a nation that believes in a strong state, especially in a moment of national adversity. the comparison to the united states, from which our economic liberals draw their ideas, and often funding, is instructive. compared to us, and other european countries, the global superpower is barely a functioning state, far less a nation as we understand the term. in this respect, we are fortunate to have deep cultural reserves to draw on: a certain national mythos of dogged making-do and carrying-on in the face of adversity has since the second world war defined much of the nation’s self-image, and now is the time to utilise it for the greater good. to this end, the government has proposed a mass mobilisation of 250,000 volunteers for the nhs, to deliver food and medicine to those self-isolating at official request. it is a good idea, and the speed and scale of the public’s response, with more than 400,000 volunteers already, is heartening but it perhaps does not go far enough. continuing the wartime analogy, an impromptu volunteer effort is, like the little ships at dunkirk, suited to a sudden crisis of short duration, but a sustained battle over the course of months or years requires a different degree of determination entirely. if this is genuinely a national crisis on the scale of the second world war, as the government’s extraordinary economic and political measures suggest, then we should mobilise the full resources of the state to face it. to do this, why not institute a form of conscription suited to a peacetime crisis: an nhs national service? because conscription is a form of slavery you dunderhead. it turns people – literally – into helots, slaves of the state. fuck off. releasing our youth from effective house arrest and allowing them to commit their health, vitality and purpose to the nation’s greater good is not just a quick fix to a sudden manpower shortage but a statement of who we are as a nation. it is an opportunity for the british government and people to affirm that we value younger people, and that we need them to play their part. in boosting the nhs with a transfusion of new blood where it is needed most, freeing up both trained medical staff and the armed forces for the period of greatest danger now approaching, it would be a move of some practical utility which bears within it the seeds of a far greater social good. it’s not even disguising the drooling over blood and will. fool march 26, 2020 by tim worstall ragging on ritchie 18 comments this is possible for reasons i explained in an academic article here. in that piece i explain the formula for funding government spending, which is: g = t + ∆b + ∆m where g is government spending, t is cash tax revenues, ∆b is the net change in government borrowing in a period and ∆m is the net change in government-created money in a period. hmm, ok. you will not find the formula noted above in many textbooks: i’ve searched and not found it. the ∆m bit is missing. that’s because the mainstream of economics has not recognised that such funding can take place in this way. but that’s because dogmatically they have refused to believe it possible and have insisted that government is solely dependent on funds provided by third parties to fund its activities – so perpetuating the myth of ‘taxpayer’s money’ and the ‘burden of debt’. but neither of those myths is true. the government can create money whenever it wishes, simply by deciding to spend it into existence and by instructing its own bank to create the money to make settlement of the liabilities owing. ∆m changes everything. not really, no. if you look at the accounts of the federal reserve (i assume the boe does something similar) you will see that they make a profit printing dollar bills. it’s some $99 and change on a $100 bill for example. this is sent to the treasury each and every year. we even have a name for it, seigniorage. a word which first appears in english around 1400 or so. which means we’ve been aware of the concept for some 6 centuries now just in this one language. there’s a profit to be made in making money, a profit that can be spent. and? and diocletian was certainly aware of the concept when he debased the sestercius. the and being that there are libraries full of information on what goes wrong when it is done in any volume. not starting with diocletian either. it ain’t new ritchie, it just ain’t new dear god the man’s an idiot march 26, 2020 by tim worstall ragging on ritchie 12 comments wheat futures prices – may futures! – have risen 10%. therefore: prices are rising because of consumer panic buying and threats to markets, including the closing of borders and labour shortages. i have argued for rationing and price controls. the case will become overwhelming soon. we’re not going to have another wheat harvest before may. so, what do we want to happen? we want people to stop consuming so much wheat. to stop being damn idiots panic buying. so, how do we do that? the price rises. the system is working. so snippa decides we need a new one? come on people, this was laid out in wealth of nations, 244 years ago. how long does it take for the sage of ely to grasp an idea? bollocks march 26, 2020 by tim worstall business 42 comments retail stalwart primark has refused to pay its rent bill as it seeks more support from its landlords in a sign of the chaos sweeping the high street. the firm is scrambling to save cash after being forced to shut all of its stores at a cost of £650m a month in lost sales. a host of firms are thought to have refused to pay rent on wednesday, the day when quarterly bills are due for a huge number of retail players. that primark is among them despite being one of the most resilient names in the industry shows the huge pressure firms are under. that’s not a sign of the pressure primark is under. it’s a sign of the pressure primark can apply, given that it has market power in these extreme times. so, imagine that you’re one of the leading and most profitable clothes retailers in the country. and everyone around you is going bust. so, they get rent reductions and you don’t. that isn’t going to make you happy. so, you scweam and scweam until you’re sick and you too get rent reductions. true, the landlords are so screwed. but that makes who unhappy? <a
