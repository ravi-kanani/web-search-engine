i came to love that so much about him and also that he didn’t judge me for not being able, at least initially, to just relax and be in the moment. heather with oona, mom to the first litter of kittens she ever rescued, who lives with her, matt and their daughter to this very day. and of course i just had to ask the million dollar question. how did these kittens save her? they taught me that i could handle responsibility for another being’s life. i never really committed to anything for long before rescuing these cats. growing up an air force brat, i moved around all the time so what i was good at was change and moving. they showed me i could sit and be and accept, rather than trying always to control and arrange things. trying to exert control is exhausting, not to mention illusiory! so if you’re looking for an uplifting, honest, thoughtful book about cats with a relatable protagonist, check out to catch a cat. my only suggestion for improving it would be to include a section with photos – maybe for the second printing! if you’ve already read the book, we’d love to hear what you thought about it! this entry was posted in cats, reviews and tagged adopt don't shop, cat book, cat lady, cat woman, foster cats, new york, new york city, nyc, nyc living. bookmark the permalink. ← stylish multipurpose cat furniture cat woman wednesday: housecat club founder ashlynn brink → 12 responses to to catch a cat: how three stray kittens rescued me (book review) momma kat and her bear cat says: september 14, 2016 at 12:59 pm i need to read this book!
