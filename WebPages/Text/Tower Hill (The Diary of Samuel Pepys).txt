but, though this great area might be rendered extremely beautiful, it is quite the reverse, in almost every other part besides that just mentioned, we find it ill built, and the ground a mere dunghill; particularly in little towerhill, where we see either the backs of the houses next this fine area, or mean edifices in ruins. but as the hill is now improved and rendered more safe by placing strong wooden rails on the outside of the ditch, it is to be hoped that the ground will be completely levelled, and laid out to greater advantage, and that some care will be taken to rebuild the houses that are falling down, particularly as this is a place visited by all strangers. ---london and its environs described. r. dodsley, 1761. log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 oct 4 nov 27 1661 apr 22 oct 3 1662 jan 27 jun 14 16 aug 30 nov 27 1663 feb 23 26 jun 15 jul 7 sep 5 1664 oct 9 dec 24 1665 sep 14 oct 16 1666 jun 13 sep 3 7 nov 5 dec 19 1667 mar 4 22 may 11 20 21 jun 13 14 dec 13 1668 apr 30 may 6 maps see all places in this category on one map latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
