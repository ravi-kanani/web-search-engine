40k 57k 41k 9.6k industries › transportation & logistics statistics and market data about transport & logistics in this section, statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the transportation and logistics industries. today, there is a plethora of transport modes around the world, the most dominant ones being road and rail transport, as well as ship transport and aviation. global passenger demand is on the rise both in mature and emerging markets, where the population is becoming increasingly affluent and mobile. despite the growing number of bicycles, motorcycles, coaches, trains, planes and even cruise ships in use, the automobile is still the most popular form of passenger travel. thanks to the car’s popularity, the automotive industry has made a strong comeback from the 2008 financial crisis. toyota, general motors and vw are ranked as the largest passenger car manufacturers worldwide. the volkswagen group is also counted among the world’s leading truck manufacturers, trailing only germany’s daimler and china’s dongfeng. in terms of cargo transportation, trade relations between china, north america and the european free trade association (efta) are forecast to drive up traffic demand over the coming years. while cargo aircraft are often used to transport mail, animals and dangerous items, bulk products are typically carried by railways, trucks and ships. in the logistics industry, intermodal freight traffic is the most common choice to move consumer goods. intermodal transport facilitates and expedites cargo traffic because the freight is shipped in containers that move interchangeably by commercial vehicles, railroads and container ships. picture: istockphoto.com / illchashow more industry overview
