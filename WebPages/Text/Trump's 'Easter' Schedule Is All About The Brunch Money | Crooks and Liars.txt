(it might be canceled due to the city being shut down). the manager of trump's dc hotel promises a "huge celebration in a few weeks." the hotel hosts a big easter brunch -- for $130 a head.https://t.co/nhmi1yfpm7 pic.twitter.com/gbcabntv1z — eric umansky (@ericuman) march 26, 2020 the day after the hotel put up that promo the mayor of dc closed non-essential businesses & prohibited gatherings of 10 or more people. no easter brunch for donnie. 🤣https://t.co/tscupm4jit — shirley's galaxy of paw washing cats 🐱🐾🐱 (@shirleysgalaxy) march 27, 2020 did i mention it's a buffet, where large numbers of strangers share serving utensils? so this is why trump says we will all be healthy by easter. gotta have $130.00 a plate easter brunch. trump is breathtakingly selfish and dangerous.#trumpmadness #trumpviruscoverup — lazy circles (@lazycircles) march 27, 2020 tags: covid19, donald trump hotels, easter facebook twitter pinterest flipboard email can you help us out?
