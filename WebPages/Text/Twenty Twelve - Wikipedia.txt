the pair constantly clash. finally, head of infrastructure graham hitchens gives the impression that he knows everything about the london transport and traffic systems, but is completely ignorant, has no clue about deadlines and frequently upsets various officials. cast[edit] character actor position series one two ian fletcher hugh bonneville head of deliverance of the olympic deliverance commission main kay hope amelia bullmore head of sustainability main sally owen olivia colman ian fletcher's personal assistant main nick jowett vincent franklin head of contracts main siobhan sharpe jessica hynes head of brand main graham hitchins karl theobald head of infrastructure main fi healey morven christie head of legacy main daniel stroud samuel barnett ian fletcher's personal assistant main karl marx joel fry brand consultant recurrent barney lumsden alex beckett brand consultant recurrent coco lomax sara pascoe brand consultant recurrent episodes[edit] series 1[edit] no. title overnight viewers original airdate 1 "countdown" 417,000 14 march 2011 (2011-03-14) pr consultant siobhan sharpe is preparing to unveil a countdown clock in front of tate modern. however, her boss ian fletcher is not impressed. kay hope struggles to find a post-games use for the taekwondo arena. meanwhile, graham hitchins is planning a new traffic management system, which he decides to test on the day of the clock unveiling. 2 "visitors from rio" 474,000 21 march 2011 (2011-03-21) the odc take a group of delegates to meet lord coe at the london olympic park. however, the traffic and a bus driver who doesn't know london conspire against them. olympic organiser lord "seb" coe makes a cameo appearance as himself in this episode.[4] 3 "roman remains" 420,000 28 march 2011 (2011-03-28) after the discovery of roman remains near the aquatics centre, the building plans need to be modified at the last minute. meanwhile, siobhan sharpe wants the 2012 games to have their own audio logo. 4 "raising the bar" 419,000 4 april 2011 (2011-04-04) former olympic athlete dave wellbeck tours schools as brand ambassador for raising the bar, a campaign to get young people interested in the olympic games. but his lack of charisma has the opposite effect and ian fletcher and siobhan sharpe are unsure on how to proceed. 5 "cultural curator" 389,000 11 april 2011 (2011-04-11) for the post of curator of the cultural olympiad three applicants are being interviewed. meanwhile, sebastian coe suggests that the olympic deliverance commission team consider entering the london marathon. 6 "equestrian controversy" 432,000 18 april 2011 (2011-04-18) the odc's plans for the equestrian centre annoy famous film director tony ward (tim mcinnerny), who dumps a pile of horse manure in front of their offices. ian fletcher decides to challenge him face-to-face on a radio 4 today interview. series 2[edit] no. title overnight viewers original airdate 1 "boycott" – part 1 1,200,000 30 march 2012 (2012-03-30) the algerian olympic team threatens to boycott the games after discovering that the shared belief centre does not face mecca.[5] 2 "boycott" – part 2 972,000 (overnight) 6 april 2012 (2012-04-06) it is the second half of a very long day. the algerians issue a deadline of midnight for a solution to their demand for a shared belief centre which faces mecca, while the french threaten to pull out of the games if a separate mosque is built. the team have to come up with an idea that will please everyone.[6] 3 "clarence house" tba 13 april 2012 (2012-04-13) a decision must be made about the future of the olympic stadium, and clarence house has asked the odc to look at ways of linking the 2012 olympics with the queen's diamond jubilee – is 'jubilympics' the perfect branding solution?[7] 4 "the rapper" tba 20 april 2012 (2012-04-20) siobhan's team design a major sexual health campaign, complete with a rap song "get it on", which may upset the catholic competitors. 5 "catastrophisation" 1,450,000 10 july 2012 (2012-07-10) thirty two days to go, and with head of deliverance ian fletcher chairing the final ever meeting of the twenty twelve security committee's special catastrophisation unit, it emerges that someone has been caught converting official olympic starting pistols to fire live rounds;

ed cumming in the telegraph stated "perhaps it just needs some time to settle. though it was very funny in parts, the first episode of twenty twelve suggests that the series, like the actual cost of the olympics, might hit slightly wide of its ample target."[8] likewise, sam wollaston in the guardian suggested that due to the participation of seb coe it was "on song": "biting satire this isn't. it's nibbling satire, delivered by garra rufa fish...the thick of it is a lot more entertaining...i don't think that politicians were removing their shoes, rolling up their trousers and queuing up for cameos in the thick of it".[9] brian viner, writing in the independent was more impressed by coe's cameo; "there is surely no other country in the world that would laugh at itself in this way, even persuading the vast project's principal mover-and-shaker, in our case the rt hon lord coe kbe, to participate in the joke". he went on to commend the series "...i was hooked anyway, by the mischief in john morton's script and the beautifully nuanced performances of, in particular, hugh bonneville and jessica hynes".[10] brian viner, reviewing the series as a whole stated the series was "always amusing and sporadically very funny... it's hard to think of a spoof documentary that has been more fortuitously timed than twenty twelve."[11] real-life similarities[edit] it was widely commented upon in the press that the day after the broadcast of the first episode, which features problems with the 1,000-day countdown clock, the real-life clock in trafalgar square broke soon after it had been launched by lord coe and london mayor boris johnson.[12] an additional coincidence occurred when some of the first athletes to arrive in london for the olympics suffered delays; their bus drivers were unfamiliar with london and unable to find the olympic park in scenes that closely resembled the plot of episode 2.[13] the games plagiarism accusation[edit] twenty twelve has been criticised as bearing a strong resemblance to the australian mockumentary series the games, a similar series set before the 2000 sydney olympics.[14] writer of the games john clarke said, "we worked very hard on that project and we had long conversations with these people who've now done a show like that in britain".[15][15][16] the bbc denied claims of plagiarism. "it is a very different show, the only similarities between them are that they are both set around the olympics," a corporation source said.[17] clarke's own website later made a reference to the dispute by describing himself and writing partner as "run[ning] a charitable institute supplying formats to british television".[18] awards and nominations[edit] the programme was the winner of the best sitcom category at the british comedy awards 2011,[19] while jessica hynes received the best comedy performance award for her role from the royal television society.[20] for his role in twenty twelve osy ikhile was nominated for "best tv comedy performance" at the black international film festival and music video & screen awards.[21] in may 2013, the programme was awarded title of 'best sitcom' at the annual bafta awards, with star olivia colman also picking up the award for 'best female comedy performance', a category in which co-star jessica hynes was also nominated. hugh bonneville also received a nomination for his role of head of deliverance, ian fletcher.[22] year award nominee category result reference 2011 british comedy awards john morton best tv sitcom won [23] hugh bonneville best tv comedy actor nominated john morton best new comedy programme 2012 bafta tv award olivia colman best female performance in a comedy programme nominated [23] hugh bonneville best male performance in a comedy programme british comedy awards twenty twelve best sitcom nominated [23] hugh bonneville best tv comedy actor jessica hynes best tv comedy actress olivia colman broadcasting press guild awards john morton, paul schlesinger best comedy/entertainment nominated [23] 2013 bafta tv award olivia colman best female performance in a comedy programme won [23] john morton, paul schlesinger, catherine gosling fuller, jon plowman best situation comedy won john morton best writer: comedy nominated jessica hynes best female performance in a comedy programme nominated hugh bonneville best male performance in a comedy programme nominated broadcasting press guild awards john morton best comedy/entertainment won [23] writer's award nominated rts television awards jessica hynes best comedy performance won [23] john morton best writer - comedy nominated dvd release[edit] on 23 october 2012 bbc home entertainment released the entire series in a two-disc dvd set.[24] sequel[edit] main article: w1a (tv series) after the final episode had aired, there was speculation in the media about a third series with the team liaising with the organisation team of the rio de janeiro games in 2016, or becoming management consultants.[25] when asked about whether the hit show could return, main star bonneville said, "absolutely. they could go and help with the organisation of the rio games in 2016...but ultimately, this is a crack team that could go anywhere and manage anything – the city, say, or the armed services. the nhs also needs rebranding. they could get ian in to announce, 'if health is about anything, it's about managing expectations. we have got to get people to appreciate there are a lot of positive things about ill health. we need to make it sexy'."[26] a sequel was announced by the bbc in late 2013 and broadcast march 19 to april 9, 2014. named w1a, it follows ian fletcher (bonneville) and siobhan sharpe (jessica hynes) as they pursue new careers as part of the bbc management team. a second series was commissioned in september 2014 and broadcast april 23 to may 14, 2015. a third series began airing on 18 september 2017. see also[edit] olympic delivery authority london organising committee of the olympic games and paralympic games references[edit] ^ "bbc four recommissions hit comedy series twenty twelve". bbc press office. 15 april 2011. ^ "the british comedy award-winning twenty twelve returns tonight for a four-part second series". bbc press office. retrieved 17 march 2012. ^ mickel, andrew (17 december 2011).
