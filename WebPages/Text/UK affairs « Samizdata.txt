niall kilmartin (stirling) · civil liberties · constitution · uk affairs duke gorlois of cornwall: “lord uther, if i yield to the sword of power – what will you yield?” uther pendragon: “me yield !!!??” (from the film excalibur*) we are yielding quite a few liberties to the dread virus – to the need to flatten the curve of disease to what the nhs can handle. steve baker’s speech says it well. as regards mere money, the government will provide tide-you-over assistance to those whose cash flow cannot outlast these measures. their loss will still be a net loss (and since all the government’s money is ultimately provided by us, the tide-you-over sum will one day be repaid with interest) but there is help for those facing outgoings with no incomings. how about the liberty account? as we yield many liberties, could the state perhaps yield back a few others they have taken? might the police who will now ask, “is your journey really necessary under our latest emergency regulations?”, include all who were previously asking, “is your remark really permissible under our modern hate speech laws?” any chance the power of the state, when not enforcing the new rules, could be wholly focussed on fighting things the public consider criminal, not things the politically correct consider offensive? it is a fair question (to the state, but even more to the ‘elite’ apocalypticists): if we yield to the danger of the virus – what will you yield? — * (quoted from my old memory of the film. if i’ve remembered it right, i think uther’s grammar is wrong here – it should be “i yield”.) march 24th, 2020 | 21 comments we are all uighurs now. mr ed · opinions on liberty · privacy & panopticon · self ownership · uk affairs the ramblings of our prime minister this evening, no data, no projections, no reasoning other than the projected incompetence of our nationalised health care system, no laws cited (but they are there), and have been since 10th february 2020, backed up by threats and fear-mongering, announcing restrictions on the uk in an echo of what the chinese communist party is imposing on uighurs, evidence the triumph of the chinese communist party in crushing the west, without (and indeed on account of not) lifting a finger. and yet the borders remain open, as far as we know, to flights from hotspots such as china, italy, spain and iran. this has all been thought through, and johnson is content that it be so, is he being played or a player?

niall kilmartin (stirling) · humour · uk affairs violating lockdown has joined hate speech on the very short list of crimes that the mayor of london does want enforced. he favours having the army deal with lockdown violators. some 15 years ago, the lieutenant-colonel who was to handle a key part of lockdown if terrorists hit london with a bioweapon was someone i knew well. “lucky you”, my friends said, when that chanced to come up in conversation. “while we’re being gunned down by the ruthless soldiery as we try to flee the capital, you’ll be able to slip through the lines.” – to which i replied (jokingly – they thought! 🙂 ), “you don’t know her. she’ll shoot down her friends with the others; why do you think she got the job!” i think my friend would have made full colonel if she’d stuck with it, but the time demands on the rest of her life would have been too great and she is now happily pursuing other choices. i don’t know who would be in charge if the army were called in, but i hope they’ll have the same willingness to call sadiq khan out – not least because the only consideration that might make him and his kind hesitate to see the crisis as “a terrible thing to waste” is the worry that others might think the same. march 22nd, 2020 | 14 comments what joining a union can do for you natalie solent (essex) · arts & entertainment · media & journalism · uk affairs in laurence fox’s case, get you officially denounced – and then a payout for being denounced. in the midst of a pandemic, this story, comparatively trivial but not without consequences, may have passed you by. laurence fox is an actor and musician. two months ago he caused rather a stir on the bbc political panel show question time. i posted about it here: has the bbc stopped putting bromide in its actors’ tea? as i said in that post, the actors’ union equity helped spread the story by calling on actors to “unequivocally denounce” their fellow. yes, those exact words. equity has now backtracked, but it went to prove mr fox’s point. in the end equity had to do more than backtrack. on march 13th the guardian reported, equity apology to laurence fox sparks string of resignations. the entire race equality committee of equity has resigned in protest after the actors’ union apologised on its behalf for criticising laurence fox’s views on race and paid an out-of-court settlement to the actor after he threatened to sue them for libel. i am sure they will be greatly missed. the former star of the detective drama lewis also used his appearance on the bbc discussion show to insist it was “racist” for an audience member to call him “a white, privileged male”. “we’re the most tolerant, lovely country in europe,” he said at the time. “it’s so easy to throw the card of racism at everybody and it’s really starting to get boring now.” in the aftermath of his appearance, minority representatives of the actors’ union made a series of accusations on twitter against fox, saying he wanted to “berate and bully women of colour attempting to discuss issues of race and gender discrimination”. narrator’s voice: he didn’t really. on friday, the actors’ union issued a carefully worded statement apologising for the comments, with sources saying a payment had been made to the actor: “we are sorry that in the tweets he was called a ‘disgrace’ by equity. it was a mistake for equity as an organisation to criticise him in this way. nothing in equity’s later statement was intended as a slur on his character or views, or to suggest that he should be denied the ability to work. we would like to make that clear. equity and laurence fox condemn prejudice unequivocally in all its forms.” daniel york loh, the former chair of the race equality committee, said he and his eight other colleagues on the committee, elected by the union’s minority ethnic members, felt forced to resign as a result of the decision to apologise to the actor. i think that should read “as a result of the decision to apologise to their own member”. he tweeted: “equity and la*rence f*x can issue as many joint statements and apologies as they like. it’s nothing to do with me and i apologise for nothing.” if mr loh says that equity’s apology is nothing to do with him, i assume that means that he has not just resigned from the union’s race equality committee but from the union itself – which in practice would mean that he has resigned from being an actor. a principled decision indeed. fox, a member of a well-known acting family, previously said he was concerned he would not be able to work following the intervention from the equity race equality committee. a source close to fox said a particular concern was its call for him to be “unequivocally denounced” for his comments on race, which could have reduced his ability to earn money from roles and make a living to enable him to look after his family. having lost its race equality committee, equity might like to see if it can manage without replacing this expensive luxury. march 22nd, 2020 | 7 comments samizdata quote of the day samizdata illuminatus (arkham, massachusetts) · slogans & quotations · uk affairs no; fuckwit lefties of twitter – that the crashcart has arrived and a medic is urgently applying paddles to a patient in arrest does *not* mean a defibrillation session every morning would do us all good. – guy herbert march 20th, 2020 | 6 comments destroying our economy to save the nhs? johnathan pearce (london) · health & medical · hippos · uk affairs this is probably one of the few places in the internet, never mind the regular media, where people can get to debate the wonders of socialised medicine without being under the burden of proving that they are not evil. in the uk, we have had since the late 1940s a healthcare system that dominates the field, with a relatively small private sector. the national health service, funded from tax and run as a monopoly, with politicians and civil servants allocating resources, was modeled, as so many post-war institutions were, on the idea of state central planning. the narrative of the time was that planning was the way to go, unlike all that messy, chaotic “laissez faire” that had been associated, however wrongly, with the great depression and so on. (here is a good paper on the nhs by the institute of economic affairs.) i can also recommend this book, by james bartholomew on the many problems with the uk welfare state. the nhs, like many of the other socialised medical systems in much of the developed world, faces the monstrous coronavirus. and so much of the current policy approach – the uk is going into more of a lockdown as of this weekend – is designed, so it is said, to flatten the potential surge of infections and deaths, so that the nhs and other systems don’t collapse. the cost/benefit calculation is being made that it is better to smash the world economy, to force millions into idleness, possibly for months, and tide them over with cash payments funded from vast amounts of debt, than it is to allow the nhs/other to be forced into a nightmare of running out of resources. in some ways i can see the merits of preventing a horrendous surge in deaths; i also think that saving the nhs and other models of healthcare is a sort of virility test of today’s welfare states. nothing can be done to admit they have limits, even if that means economic damage on a major scale. that cost/benefit calculation may look just about defensible now, but what about in two months’ time, particularly if there is no real sign of a deceleration in the virus, but if the struggle to buy even basic household necessities leaves a lot of people in real hardship? i assume that farmers and others in the food production business are not being told to stay at home, but such is the level of madness about this situation that i wonder. i’d like to know how locking people in their homes for months is going to be enforced. there are also health considerations to be taken into account by such a lock-down, particularly if it goes on for months on end. humanity is not designed for prison, and those of us in relatively free societies (“relatively” being the operative word) will move from being restless to downright homicidal of this goes on into the summer and beyond. there aren’t enough police to keep everyone cooped up in their homes. those bastards in the chinese communist party have a lot to answer for. and yes, covid-19 began there, and it shows how derelict some of our media/political class has become that is frowned upon to point that out. (the anger is rising, and will have major consequences for our geopolitics.) it would be rather ironic to think that something unleashed by a communist state, whether by accident or whatever, has put such pressure on welfare state societies in the west. final point: i was due to give a talk tonight at brian micklethwait’s place about the recent calls for anti-trust assaults on the big techs such as facebook, google and amazon, and i was going to look at parallels with the campaign to break up j d rockefeller’s standard oil more than a century ago. one thing you can say about rockefeller, was that as well as being a brilliant businessman, and philanthropist in the area of healthcare, among others, he also understood the importance of integrated supply chains in commerce. he’d have looked at our current predicament with interest. march 20th, 2020 | 40 comments samizdata quote of the day natalie solent (essex) · economics, business & globalization · european union · health & medical · slogans & quotations · uk affairs there are no limits to our commitment to the euro. – christine lagarde, president of the european central bank. the linked guardian article in which i found the quote is titled “ecb u-turn shows it fears coronavirus could destroy eurozone project”. march 19th, 2020 | 38 comments and robbers natalie solent (essex) · self defence & security · uk affairs the games of children, we are told, enable them to learn about how the adult world works and practise its ways. in my childhood we played a game called “cops and robbers”. in our innocence we thought we were imitating the grown ups. perhaps we were, in the 1970s. but in 2020 the grown up coppers have tired of that game and gone off to do something else. the times reports, boots makes legal history after police let thief go it was no surprise to anyone who knew nicholas richards, a career criminal with 25 convictions including 18 for shoplifting, that his motives were not entirely honourable when he walked into boots. witnesses described him stealing £170-worth of gucci perfume; cctv footage recovered from the chemist’s flagship branch in piccadilly showed him putting the goods in his bag; and cameras worn by private security officers who detained him recorded him admitting the offence. so staff at boots, which loses between £10,000 and £12,000 a week to shoplifting, were upset when police officers arrived on the crime scene, decided the case was a “civil” matter and released richards, who was already on a suspended sentence for theft. boots was furious about the failure to dispense justice and decided to take part in what is believed to be the first private prosecution for shoplifting supported by a corporate victim. the case is being brought by tm eye. set up by two former metropolitan police officers, it is the parent company of my local bobby (mlb), which provides neighbourhood policing to residents, firms and shops. its 30 “bobbies”, who wear red vests and caps, provide 24-hour cover. they are mostly former police officers and soldiers. richards has pleaded guilty, so it all seems to have worked out all right in the end. this time. this is the nice version of what happens when the state justice system fails and private individuals must step in to fill the void. there is also a less nice version. march 15th, 2020 | 29 comments everybody gets to be racist eventually natalie solent (essex) · how very odd! · media & journalism · mindless "inequality" blather · uk affairs the latest newly discovered racist is trevor phillips. trevor phillips, the former head of the equalities watchdog, has condemned labour’s decision to suspend him from the party over alleged islamophobia, while defending his view that the uk muslim population is “different”. phillips, a pioneering anti-racism campaigner who previously chaired the equality and human rights commission (ehrc), has been suspended from labour pending an investigation and could be expelled. to me, the remarks in question seem to have an honest attempt to engage with the fact that the attitudes of the muslim population do differ sharply from the uk average – surely a matter of public interest. some here, remembering mr phillips’ previous role as head of the commission for racial equality and his lifetime of commitment to the ideal of enforced equality, will speak of karma and say “what goes around comes around”. i disagree. as a matter of policy and humanity, when someone starts to move in the right direction we should not rebuff them. march 9th, 2020 | 24 comments older entries » who are we?
