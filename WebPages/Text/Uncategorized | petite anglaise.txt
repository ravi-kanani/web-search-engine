petite anglaise september 11, 2008 boss filed under: uncategorized — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:55 am the first time it happens, i’m sitting with tadpole and the boy in my favourite chinese snack bar, tucking into pork and herb ravioli while rain hammers down on the pavement outside. ‘ouch,’ i say, rubbing a raised bump on my arm which i’ve just knocked against the table. ‘goodness knows what i’ve done to myself this time, but it really hurts! look, j’ai un bosse, là…’ tadpole’s face cycles through several possible reactions – confusion, perplexity, amazement – before finally settling on amusement. ‘un bosse, mummy?’ she says teasingly, shooting a sidelong glance at the boy, who is smirking into his shanghai noodles. ‘but don’t you know? un bosse doesn’t exist! a lump is called une bosse, in french.’ ‘okay, i’ve got une bosse then,’ i say, defensively, my cheeks smarting. it’s not as though i’ve never made a gender blunder in front of tadpole before. but it’s the first time she’s noticed, or at least the first time she’s decided to call me out on it, pressing home her native speaker’s advantage. ‘you know, i didn’t even start learning french until i was eleven-years-old,’ i explain. ‘so it’s normal for me to make mistakes sometimes. i wasn’t lucky enough to learn two languages when i was small, like you. and the thing i find most difficult is choosing un ou une or le or la because they don’t even exist in english.’ tadpole falls silent, her face deadly serious as she processes this new information. she may be fortunate enough to know, instinctively, which combination of words sounds right or wrong, but i doubt she’s ever stopped to wonder why english nouns don’t behave in the same way. in fact, one of her most common blunders, just now, is to refer to a chair as a she or a pencil as a he. ‘i see what you mean, mummy,’ she says, finally, turning to face me and putting a hand on my arm – right on my bosse – causing me to gasp. ‘don’t worry,’ she adds in a reassuring voice, ‘i’m going to teach you how to say right all the words.’ she lets go of my arm and opens both of hers wide to illustrate just how many words we have to get through. ‘how about we start with table,’ she says, clearly enjoying herself, now. ‘do you think it’s un table or une table..?’ on a saturday morning a couple of weeks later, tadpole and i are sitting on the sofa in our respective nightwear: ‘ello kitty pyjamas – she refuses to pronounce the ‘hello’ in ‘hello kitty’ with an aspirant ‘h’ – and a black silk negligé. she’s just finished reading me a story in english, which she now sets aside in favour of a french story anthology. the deal we struck when she came to interrupt me – mid gum thief – was that she would read me one story in english, then one in french. she chooses the shortest one, which is about a naïvely drawn blue teddy bear called pénélope, who is trying to remember the words to a well-known children’s song. i’m not familiar with it, as this particular story book is reserved for french babysitters and occasionally the boy, if he gets home from work before storytime. ‘pénélope chante à tue-tête…’ reads tadpole. before she can launch into the song, i interrupt. ‘what does tue-tête mean?’ i ask her, with a puzzled frown. ‘i don’t think i’ve ever heard anyone say that before…’ ‘really?’ says tadpole, as though she can barely believe her ears. i nod, bashfully, half-wishing i’d held my peace. ‘tue-tête means pénélope is singing as loud as she can,’ she explains in a decidedly schoolmistressy voice, cranking up her internal volume dial to better illustrate her point and eliciting a groan from the boy, who is sleeping in the bedroom, a few metres away. ‘right, i see,’ i say, nodding. ‘in english we’d say she was singing at the top of her voice.’ the next time tadpole uses a word i’m unfamiliar with, i keep stumm, slinking off to my desk at the first opportunity to leaf quietly through my collins robert dictionary. it’s one thing admitting i’m not absolutely infallible. but the word ‘boss’, in this household, is a feminine noun. an adult feminine noun, to be precise. and while i’m quite happy to let tadpole savour the sweet feeling of superiority from time to time, i don’t think i want the balance of power shifting too far in her direction. comments (113) may 22, 2007 french masterclass filed under: uncategorized — petiteanglaiseparis @ 3:43 pm if you have been following this blog for a while, you will be aware of the fact that i am rather irrationally fond of very scientific-sounding french words used to denote common things. my love of the word podotactile, which can be translated into english with the slightly less elegant “strip along the side of a métro platform that has bumps on that you can feel if you are wearing thin-soled shoes” has already been widely documented. peeling the transparent film off a microwave dinner the other day (and yes, i know it’s bad, but believe me, that was one of my better moments, nutritionally, in recent weeks) i was overjoyed to notice that said transparent cover is called an l’opercule, a term which comes from latin and is also used in neuroscience and botany. imagine, if you will, that the instructions on your microwave meal asked you to “pull back the operculus”. would you have any appetite left? but my favourite new phrase by far is the one used to designate the place where water must be poured into my new steam iron (after old iron was accidentally melted in a freak hob-top incident at the weekend when i tried to cook pasta with a hangover). i give you: l’orifice de remplissage. i’m looking at it warily right now and i just don’t know if i can. comments (80) february 6, 2007 gros mot filed under: uncategorized — petiteanglaiseparis @ 11:07 am it recently came to my attention that a fantasy swear word coined, i believe, by my very good friend in blogging anna boat may soon be the subject of a heated debate chez les prud’hommes. a comment i took the precaution of removing from my site some time ago has seemingly found its way into the possession of a certified translator, for use in my industrial tribunal case (which theoretically takes place this month, if no-one defers it). it went something like this: petite: “i’m thinking of setting up a parallel secret blog named “my boss is a twunt”. hmm. clearly a tongue in cheek play on words which any self-respecting blogger/blogreader would understand as a reference to the famous zed and her award winning blog, no doubt a quip made in response to another comment, although i no longer have the faintest idea of the exact context. the problem being that the french translator, clearly coming a little unstuck at the sight of the inventive slight, an amalgamation of two words of differing intensity which share etymological origins with the word “ladyparts”, decided to opt for the rather stronger french expletive “enculé” in the version to which he/she put the holy certified translator’s stamp. unfortunate in the extreme, as “enculé” is a word which has nothing whatsoever to do with “ladyparts”, is the strongest french swearword i know of, and is emphatically not a word i would ever dream of sullying my fair lips with. i think it is fair to say that many layers of intended humour and irony have been well and truly lost in translation. the upside of all this (aside from the fact that my audience is likely to be interesting for those involved, and indeed for spectators) is that surely it can only be a matter of time before the académie française falls in love with the neologism and deems it necessary to add “twunt” to the official french dictionary. now there’s an achievement of which i would be truly proud. comments (58) october 13, 2005 slippery slope filed under: uncategorized — petiteanglaiseparis @ 10:00 am tadpole is having her bath. i am seated next to her, on the toilet, as there is really no where else to sit in our two and a half square metre bathroom. “mummy mummy mummy!” shouts tadpole, excitedly. “look mummy!” i lower my copy of heat and give her my full attention. “what do you want to show me?” i enquire, feigning interest. “mummy. regarde! le bateau, il a chaviré!” oh. my. god. just twenty eight months old and she is now using french words which i can only understand with the help of a dictionary. comments (42) older posts » search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
