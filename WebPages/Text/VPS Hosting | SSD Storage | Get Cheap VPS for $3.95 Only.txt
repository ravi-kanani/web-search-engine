(faq) find answers to some frequently asked questions about cheap vps hosting & best virtual private servers. what is vps? a vps stands for “virtual private server.” let's break it down: as the name suggests, it is a private server, which means, that it will be exclusively yours. having a vps service gives you a set amount of resources that you don’t need to share with anyone. it’s kind of like having your very own dedicated or private server, but virtual. in this case, “virtual” means that it is a partition on a physical server, that is dedicated to you. this virtual server gives you the chance to gain root access, install your preferred os and work on your project with unparalleled freedom. we take care of the back-end business, manage the physical servers, guarantee speed, uptime, and stability, while you can focus entirely on your project. what is a virtual dedicated server? how is it different from vps? the two services are similar, but there are some fundamental differences. a vps server will let you create multiple instances on a single dedicated server. while a vds or virtual dedicated server will do the same, but take up the entirety of the dedicated server. virtual private server hosting is the perfect price-power option for large projects as it grants large amounts of dedicated resources and the most control while being infinitely cheaper than having your own physical dedicated server. what is cloud computing? cloud computing is a method of using resources through a network of interlinked remote servers rather than a single, dedicated machine. cloud computing takes advantage of the high-speed internet and by using sophisticated software, can compute various demanding applications with great efficiency. this kind of computing can manage, process and store data as a regular server. there are several significant benefits that cloud computing provides: it is incredibly flexible, seamlessly scalable, resilient and stable and allows smooth migration. what is the real advantage of using vps hosting? there are a few things that make vps hosting the best option for specific projects. in short: if you need a lot of resources and unparalleled stability - vps hosting is for you, but the actual answer is a little bit longer. first of all, vps hosting gives you dedicated resources. that means you don’t need to share your cpu power, ram or disk space. you have an allocated amount that you control at your will, entirely. the nature of virtual server hosting guarantees stability. since all the resources are carefully managed and allocated to the users, you can rest easy knowing that any periods of high usage will not impact your server stability. lastly, arguably the most significant advantage of vps hosting comes at the highest price. you get root access and unparalleled control of the resources granted. that means that you can install a wide range of operating systems, work on resource-heavy projects and do much more, than with shared hosting. but sadly, the customer support team will only help you with questions relating to vps hosting management and other back-end related queries. what are the differences between vps and shared hosting? vps and shared hosting have some similarities, but they’re fundamentally different kinds of services. shared hosting packages are aimed for small projects, such as personal blogs and similar sites. resource intensive or high-traffic projects might encounter issues while using a shared hosting service. shared hosting is incredibly beginner friendly and fully managed, which means that our customer support team will be able to help out with most issues that might occur with your project. vps hosting, on the other hand, provides you with dedicated resources that you don’t need to share. every virtual private server hosting plan makes sure that you get the highest control of your resources. control your cpus, burst ram, manage root access and use your preferred os. the downside of vps hosting is that, while we cover the back-end and server monitoring, maintaining it 24/7, we can provide limited help to your project concerning customer support. while all vps hosting and control panel questions we will help with, programming, coding and other queries of similar nature won't be covered. what projects does vps hosting suit best? virtual server hosting is aimed towards more tech-savvy users. if you need a small website, you’re probably better off with shared hosting or premium hosting. but if you require a lot of computing power and maximum control vps hosting is only second to a dedicated server. intensive websites, web apps, online game servers, databases and other kinds of complex projects are perfect for a vps hosting service. vps hosting provides more control than any other service, as you can install your preferred os and take advantage of root access. does vps require a lot of technical knowledge? vps hosting services are semi-managed, which means that with some issues you’ll have to consult the knowledge base and tutorials, rather than receive help from our customer support. vps hosting grants unmatched control of your experience. to use all the power provided effectively, you will have to have technical knowledge. will i get any kind of assistance while using vps? vps hosting services are semi-managed. our customer support team will do their best to help with every single query that might arise and all questions relating to the back-end or control panel will be answered, but project related, front-end questions will not be covered. how to secure a vps server? when you read about vps hosting, some questions naturally arise. let's say, if there are multiple users on the same dedicated server, running virtual private servers, will they be able to access my data? that’s a valid question to raise, but in this case, we can happily inform you that you’re safe. all vps hosting services are safely partitioned by specific software, which guarantees top-notch protection. in addition all hostinger servers are protected by bitninja, advanced ddos protection and other custom built tools that both monitor and protect our entire infrastructure. do you provide a dedicated ip address for vps plans? all vps hosting plans provide the user with a dedicated ip address. can i install custom software on my vps server? yes, you can! that’s the beauty of a vps hosting service. it gives unparalleled control over your project! on hostinger you can pick between dozens of different linux based operating systems to suit your needs. when should you move to vps hosting? the best time to turn to vps hosting is when you have gathered up the technical knowledge that you may need for this endeavor or when your shared hosting account no longer provides enough resources for your project, and you need to go bigger! can i easily upgrade vps to a higher plan? of course! we have prepared 6 different plans that can fit any project. with every growth period, you can nearly seamlessly pick a more powerful plan and upgrade with no downtime at all. do you provide windows vps hosting? yes, we provide windows
