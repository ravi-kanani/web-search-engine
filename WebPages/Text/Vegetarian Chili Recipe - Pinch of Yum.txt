sometimes your ways just hypnotize me and even when you’re made without meat?! yes, that’s right. i’d like to introduce to you a really good, really “meaty” and satisfying vegetarian chili that, in fact, does not have meat in it at all. let’s talk vegetarian chili “meat” this vegetarian chili features a hearty mixture of walnuts, mushrooms, and carrots that can beautifully stand in place of your ground beef and absorbs the big flavors of sautéed onion and garlic, diced green chiles, and all those spices. when scooped and topped with some avocado or cheese, sour cream or tortilla chips, it’s just warming and so satisfying in that chili-specific way. and, bonus, it’s totally meatless. i have some requirements for my vegetarian chili and the first is that i want it to be really on-point texturally. i want it to scoop like a real chili. i don’t want soup, okay? i want a thick and meaty-like chili texture. the “meat” mixture in this recipe is going to ensure that texture. my second requirement for my veg chili is equally as important: low-to-no beans. i love beans as much as the next person, but sometimes i feel like they are overused in vegetarian lookalike recipes (like vegetarian chili, for example) where we could easily use vegetables more creatively instead of defaulting to 27 types of beans as the base of the recipe. i don’t know, i have opinions, okay? here’s what’s to love this vegetarian chili is all the good things that i’m looking for: thick and hearty and “meaty”, like a standard chili texture beans optional – add if you like them, leave out if you don’t big, big, big happy flavor packed with a variety of veggies easy to make makes awesome leftovers meatless! if you’re vegan, don’t you worry – this is also a vegan chili if you just watch your toppings. avocado, pickled red onion, radishes, tortilla chips… we got you, vegans. also: see our instant pot pumpkin walnut chili recipe – it’s real good. i am not a vegetarian or vegan but i hope it’s obvious that i think creative plant-based cooking is so fun and i love the positive impact it has on our bodies and the earth. ♡ you can be all kinds of everything (vegan, vegetarian, or none, imho) and 100% enjoy this. goals for the rest of the month: more vegetables, and more chili nights! check out our video for how to make vegetarian chili: vegetarian chili ★★★★★ 4.9 from 17 reviews author: lindsay prep time: 15 minutes cook time: 1 hour total time: 1 hour 15 minutes yield: 5–6 1x diet: vegetarian print recipe pin recipe description vegetarian chili that’s “meaty” and satisfying – without the meat! a hearty mixture of walnuts, mushrooms, and carrots as your base, with big flavors of onion, garlic, green chiles and spices. so good. scale 1x2x3x ingredients the “meat:” 1 cup walnuts 8 ounces fresh mushrooms, washed, stems removed 4 medium carrots, cut into chunks the chili: 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 onion, finely diced 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 6-ounce can diced green chiles (or fresh minced jalapeños) 3 tablespoons tomato paste 2–3 tablespoons chili powder 2 teaspoons cumin 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1–2 teaspoons salt (more or less to taste) 2 14-ounce cans diced or crushed tomatoes (with juices) 1 14-ounce can beans of choice (optional, see notes) 1 cup water video instructions make the “meat” – pulse all ingredients in a food processor until broken down into a chunky paste-like texture. set aside. heat the olive oil over medium heat. add the onions and garlic. sauté for 5-10 minutes until very soft. add green chiles, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and soy sauce. hello flavor. add your “meat” to the pan – once it mixes in and starts cooking, it should start to resemble chili meat. let the “meat” cook for 10 minutes or so to soften the vegetables. season with salt. add tomatoes, beans if you want, and water to get the consistency right. let it simmer for about 45 minutes to soften the vegetables, thicken it up, and let the flavors come together. serve with your favorite chili toppings, and there it is! vegetarian chili! you did it. notes beans: a lot of vegetarian chili recipes are based around beans, and i wanted this recipe to be bean-optional for people who don’t like or can’t have beans. so if you want to skip the beans altogether, no problem! that being said, i like black beans in this vegetarian chili, but kidney beans, white beans, or pinto beans would all be great. toppings: for vegetarian chili – sour cream and cheddar or queso fresco. for vegan chili – cilantro, avocado, pickled onion or jalapeno, radishes, tortilla chips. category: dinner method: stovetop cuisine: american keywords: vegetarian chili, vegan chili, chili recipe, healthy chili, vegetarian comfort food did you make this recipe?

02/27/20 @ 11:18 am reply eman @ pinch of yum we haven’t tested it out before, but it might lend a slightly different flavor. 02/27/20 @ 1:35 pm reply laura going on the menu for friday’s during lent. this looks great! 02/27/20 @ 1:43 pm reply t i am so excited to try this recipe!! love that you’ve created a “meat crumble” from real, unprocessed ingredients. 02/27/20 @ 11:44 am reply jackie that walnut and mushroom base is so clever. i wonder what other bases would work like that. definitely going to give vegetarian chili a try. http://www.ordinaryfeast.com 02/27/20 @ 12:37 pm reply michelle i’ve used riced cauliflower to make vegetarian chili in the past, but never thought about adding mushrooms or carrots (can’t have the walnuts). i’ll have to try adding them next time. 02/27/20 @ 12:48 pm reply eman @ pinch of yum enjoy, michelle! 02/27/20 @ 1:33 pm reply lori i’m not a vegetarian and this recipe looks so yummy. i can’t wait to try it. would pecans or cashews give it that same meat like texture?

i don’t want to leave the mushrooms to mush… 03/21/20 @ 10:39 am reply eman @ pinch of yum it would probably keep okay in a sealed container in the fridge for about a day after your mushrooms are washed and processed. 03/23/20 @ 3:37 pm reply natalia wow! i was so skeptical of this recipe at first when i saw the “walnut meat” 😂 but i decided to give it a go because every pinch of yum recipe i have ever made has been a total knock-out!! don’t hesitate to make this!! doesn’t taste like “meat”… but has a very heart chili taste that is sure to satisfy. thanks again! ★★★★★ 03/01/20 @ 3:23 pm reply eman @ pinch of yum so happy to hear this, natalia! 03/03/20 @ 2:53 pm reply lauren this was fantastic!!! i’m a vegetarian and my husband gave up meat for lent (but doesn’t like beans) so this recipe was perfect for a sunday dinner. kids (7 and 3) devoured it! thank you! ★★★★★ 03/01/20 @ 5:15 pm reply eman @ pinch of yum so happy to hear this, lauren! 03/03/20 @ 2:51 pm reply nam i’m 5 mos plant based now. i used to always make my midwest beef red chili each winter and thought i wouldn’t find a plant based version to match. i made this tonight. i’m in love. i wasn’t a fan of too many beans in my chili and this 1 can of black beans was perfect. i did use double amount of vegetable broth (instead of water) but that’s just preference. thank you thank you for this amazing recipe. ★★★★★ 03/01/20 @ 5:49 pm reply eman @ pinch of yum thanks for sharing! 🙂 03/03/20 @ 2:49 pm reply lindsey i made this recipe last night and really enjoyed! i so agree that vegetarian chili recipes often over-rely on beans. i’m from southwest ohio and the texture was so close to cincinnati-style chili. it made me so happy! we often serve chili over spaghetti and topped with cheese. this worked wonderfully. thanks! i also loved the gifs in the step-by-step 🙂 ★★★★★ 03/02/20 @ 11:10 am reply monica made this tonight and it was delicious! my hubby does not like chili with a ton of beans and he kept saying how he couldn’t believe this didn’t contain meat. the flavor is great and it’s very hearty. adding it to our rotation! even my 7year old picky eater loved it. ★★★★★ 03/02/20 @ 7:20 pm reply eman @ pinch of yum so happy to hear this, monica! 😊 03/03/20 @ 12:40 pm reply gail palmer i loved this, but even better my 15 year old who loves meat said this was one of the best chilis i’ve made. the whole family ate it up. will definitely make this again. thank you! 03/02/20 @ 9:43 pm reply eman @ pinch of yum so glad to hear this, gail! 03/03/20 @ 12:37 pm reply beth wow, this trick of blending the mushrooms, walnuts and carrots really changed the texture of this chili. my husband assumed i had used fake meat crumbles. i love vegetarian chili, and i miss the texture that you’d get from meat, so i’ll be using this from now on! 03/04/20 @ 5:55 pm reply eman @ pinch of yum 💃 03/05/20 @ 9:11 am reply marie wow wow and super wow!!!! it all started with a food processor. today i googled… food processor recipes. that sent me to 12 magical ways to use a food processor. that lead to reading your food processor blog that sent me to pinch of yum looking up plant based healthy foods. well this is the story… two weeks ago my husband went to his doctor who put him on a plant base diet. so of course i had to buy a food processor. then i read your food processor blog that turned into plant based/healthy recipes, to me wanting to find a chili recipe. so tomorrow i’m taking the food processor out of the box, making vegetarian/vegan chili and reading your blog from the beginning. look what a food processor can do. now this is a coincidence 03/08/20 @ 4:11 am reply j this was delicious! sure to please meat lovers as well. ★★★★★ 03/08/20 @ 11:03 am reply newer comments » hey! nice to meet you! i'm lindsay: former 4th grade teacher, now full time blogger. my husband bjork and i live in minnesota. favorite things include my camera, lake days, and dark chocolate. learn more. popular posts dinner baked mozzarella chicken rolls vegetarian vegan crunchwrap supreme quick and easy miracle no knead bread vegetarian instant pot wild rice soup blogging tips delivered straight to your inbox blogger resources top posts 1 avoiding blog burnout2 blogging as a couple3 building a blog while traveling4 how to start a food blog5 creating an income6 tools bloggers shouldn't live without7 photography tips start, grow, and monetize your food blog. join today. how’s this for awesome?
