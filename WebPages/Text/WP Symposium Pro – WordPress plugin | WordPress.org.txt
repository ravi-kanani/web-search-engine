because of the human factor. wpsp has the best real support i've ever encountered in this arena- real, as in : talking to a human being, and most likely, talking to the guy who's actually developing the product, not just some untrained "customer service" rep, or god knows who in some forum that may or may not know anything. the value of real customer service and actual support is priceless. and the written supporting documentation is outstanding. lot of function in free version ashek al mahmud may 5, 2017 this is just great for me, it save my time. within few mins i got a lot of option to manage. invitation dave8528 may 3, 2017 hi, i'm currently utilizing buddypress and looking for ulternatives which i came across your plugin. there is one feature that i'm looking for and that is invite anyone which is for buddypress. do you have such feature that users can drop emails of their friends in a box, like this screenshot: http://prntscr.com/f3raxu ...and those who accept the invitation will be in sender's network of friends. you also can see the status of your invitations sent... thanks. read all 36 reviews contributors & developers “wp symposium pro” is open source software. the following people have contributed to this plugin.contributors robert dempsey translate “wp symposium pro” into your language. interested in development?
