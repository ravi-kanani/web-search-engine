screenshots the default when viewing a blocked post - the plugin will deliver a login screen and registration form in place of blocked content (this default can be changed to other options). admin panel - options tab - the various option settings for the plugin. admin panel - fields tab - the plugin field manager allows you to manage (or delete) the installed extra fields and field order, and also add your own custom fields. admin panel - dialogs tab - the major dialogs that the plugin uses for error and other messages can be edited in the plugin's admin panel. admin panel - emails tab - all of the emails that are sent by the plugin can be edited in the admin panel. posts > all posts - the plugin adds a column to the list of posts and pages to display if a post or page is unblocked or blocked (the opposite of whatver you have set for the plugin's default in the options tab). posts > edit post - the plugin adds a meta box to the post/page editor allowing you to set an individual post to be blocked or unblocked (the opposite of whatver your default setting is). responsive forms. installation wp-members is designed to run “out-of-the-box” with no modifications to your wp installation necessary. please follow the installation instructions below. most of the support issues that arise are a result of improper installation or simply not reading/following directions. basic install: the best way to begin is to review the initial setup video. there is also a complete users guide available that covers all of the plugin’s features in depth. upload the /wp-members/ directory and its contents to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory activate the plugin through the ‘plugins’ menu in wordpress® you are ready to begin using wp-members. now follow the instructions titled “locking down your site” below. locking down your site: to restrict posts, you will need to use the <!--more--> link in your posts. content above to the “more” split will display on summary pages (home, archive, category) but the user will be required to login to view the entire post. you may also use the plugin’s auto excerpt setting to create post excerpts automatically. if you do not use the “more” tag or the auto excerpt setting, full post content is going to show on archive templates, unless the post is marked as hidden. to begin restricting pages, change the plugin default setting for pages to be blocked. unlike posts, the <!--more--> link is not necessary in the blocking of pages, but must be used if you have the “show excerpts” setting turned on for pages. to protect comments, we recommend setting “users must be registered and logged in to comment” under settings > discussion. on the settings > general page, it is recommended that you uncheck “anyone can register”. while not required, this will prevent wp’s native registration from colliding with wp-members, especially if you are using any of the wp-members additional registration fields. under settings > reading, “for each article in a feed, show” is recommended to be set to “summary.” wordpress installs with full feed settings by default. if you don’t change this, your feeds will show full content. additional setup information there are also some special pages that can be created with simple shortcodes: a user profile page where registered members can edit their information and change/reset their password: [wpmem_profile] a registration page available for those that need a specific url for registrations (such as email marketing or banner ad landing pages). note: this is strictly optional as a registration form can also be included by default on blocked content pages: [wpmem_form register] a login page. this is also an optional page as the login form is included by default on blocked content. but if you need a specific login page, this can be created with a simple shortcode: [wpmem_form login] and more shortcodes are available! powerful cusotmizations can be constructed with over 120 action and filter hooks, as well as user accessible functions. faq the faqs are maintained at https://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/docs/faqs/ reviews does the job, well documented, excellent support yeverett february 26, 2020 this plugin is excellent value - it does everything we need, is well documented and easy to setup and use. and the support is outstanding - chad replied to my question within a day, with a clear and simple resolution to my problem. i like the simplicity and it just works february 23, 2020 i use this to block pages that are not ready to be made public. only i can see them while they are being developed. now that the option to hide menu is available. i was able to remove another plugin and do it all with just this plugin. thanks. excellent plugin, and great support! djog february 22, 2020 i had a small problem with the plugin and sent a request for assistance using the customer support page on the plugin's website. i thought with luck i might get an answer to my request, and i thought at best it would take several days. but chad responded the very same day, with the solution to the problem. we've been using the wp-members plugin for years and will continue to use it. thanks chad!

(3.3.0.4) * fixes a bug when products are enabled but no default is set. allows for no default membership assigned at registration. (3.3.0.4) * fixes a bug that caused the post restricted message to display on the short form when it was in password reset and forgot username state. (3.3.0.4) * added wpmem_get_hidden_posts() api function to return an array of post ids marked as hidden. (3.3.0.4) * fixes a shortcode issue for the [wpmem_logged_in] shortcode when using the meta_key attribute. 3.3.0 added a “compare” attribute, and with this addition, it broke the original default use of the shortcode. (3.3.0.3) * fixes an issue with registration/profile form fields when used in the profile. it was intended to introduce separate selection of fields for registration and profile update in 3.3.0. however, there is an issue that causes profile fields to both (1) not correctly display and (2) if they do, they do not update correctly. (3.3.0.2) * fixes issue when updating where the stylesheet selector indicates “use_custom” but the actual url is to a default stylesheet. the problem can be corrected manually, but this fix applies the custom url to the new standard setting for the defaults. (3.3.0.1) * fixes bug where any stylesheet other than the default reverts to the default (“no float”). this was due to the database version being wiped when settings were updated. this fix correctly applies the database version when updating settings. (3.3.0.1) * fixes bug when captcha is used (unknown validate() function). the validate() function should have been declared and used as a static method. this fix declares validate() as static and then uses it as such. (3.3.0.1) * fixes undefined string variable when successful registration is executed. (3.3.0.1) 3.3.0 @todo need to resolve duplicate wpmem_login_form_defaults. (maybe took care of itself with backing out of _args deprecation) removed [wp-members] shortcode tag. this tag is obsolete will no longer function. see: https://rocketgeek.com/shortcodes/list-of-replacement-shortcodes/ removed tinymce button for shortcodes as no longer necessary with gutenberg. deprecated wpmem_inc_login_args filter, use wpmem_login_form_defaults instead. deprecated wpmem_inc_{$form}inputs and wpmem_inc{$form}args filters, use wpmem{$form}_form_defaults instead. (changepassword|resetpassword|forgotusername) deprecated wpmem_sb_login_args filter, use wpmem_login_widget_args instead. deprecated wpmem_msg_args and wpmem_msg_dialog_arr filters, use wpmem_msg_defaults instead. the following functions are deprecated, replacements should no longer be considered “pluggable”: wpmem_inc_registration() use wpmem_register_form() instead ($heading argument obsolete). wpmem_inc_changepassword() wpmem_inc_resetpassword() wpmem_inc_forgotusername() wpmem_inc_recaptcha() wpmem_build_rs_captcha() the following functions and filters are obsolete and have been removed: wpmem_shortcode() (deprecated 3.1.2) wpmem_do_sc_pages() (deprecated 3.1.8) wpmem_admin_fields() (deprecated 3.1.9) wpmem_admin_update() (deprecated 3.1.9) wpmem_user_profile() (deprecated 3.1.9) wpmem_profile_update() (deprecated 3.1.9) wpmem_dashboard_enqueue_scripts() (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->admin->dashboard_enqueue_script() instead.) wpmem_sc_forms() (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->forms() instead.) wpmem_sc_logged_in() (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->logged_in() instead.) wpmem_sc_logged_out() (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->logged_out() instead.) wpmem_sc_user_profile (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->profile() instead.) wpmem_sc_user_count() (3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->user_count() instead.) wpmem_sc_loginout 3.2.0() (deprecated use $wpmem->shortcodes->loginout() instead.) wpmem_sc_fields() (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->fields() instead.) wpmem_sc_logout() (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->logout() instead.) wpmem_sc_tos() (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->tos() instead.) wpmem_sc_avatar() (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->avatar() instead.) wpmem_sc_link() (deprecated 3.2.0 use $wpmem->shortcodes->login_link() instead.) wpmem_register_fields_arr (obsolete 3.1.7, use wpmem_fields instead.) important updates/changes major filesystem changes. the directory structure has changed and several files moved/renamed/made obsolete. if you have any wp-members customization that directly includes a file, that step is probably obsolete. the plugin has loaded most of the include files automatically since at least version 3.2, so this step has not been necessary for quite some time. however, this set of changes is more significant. (if you do not have code snippets using file includes from wp-members, this most likely will not affect you.) updated registration function to hook to user_register, important: this changes the order in which the user meta fields are saved, and also changes when the email is sent. email is now hooked to user_register, but can be unloaded if necessary. major overhaul of registration and login form, validation, and processing functions. moved things into appropriate object classes (user, forms) and deprecated legacy functions and files (register.php, forms.php). updated membership product meta and date format, important: this changes the way the user product access information is stored (going from an array of all memberships to individual meta for each) as well as the format (dates are now unix timestamp). there is an update script that will run during upgrade to handle this. for now, the legacy format is also maintained (so consider this if customzizing any processing) so that rollback is possible. updated wpmem_user_has_meta() to include a check by array when the field is multiple checkbox or multiple select. updated [wpmem_logged_in] shortcode to include an msg attribute to display a message if the user does not have access to a specified product (product must be passed as attribute). updated [wpmem_logged_in] shortcode to include a compare attribute. possible values for “compare” are “=” and “!=” to restrict if the has a meta value or the meta value is “not equal to” respectively. passing only meta_key/meta_value will still assume an “=” comparison. updated register page shortcode [wpmem_form register] logged in state – if a profile page is set, second link links to profile rather than “begin using the site”. updated users > all users screen filters, removed “not activated” replaced with “pending activation”. filter now only shows users who have not been activated, no longer includes users who were deactivated. major menus change – if you use the $wpmem->menus object directly, this is now $wpmem->menus_clone (setting $wpmem->clone_menus remains the same). wpmem_menu_settings and wpmem_menus are now wpmem_clone_menu_settings and wpmem_clone_menus. new menu handing has been introduced in the $wpmem->menus object and that will take the place of the cloned menu options. updated the way stylesheets are handled. added wpmem_get_suffix() api function to get the appropriate suffix for files (.min.css or .css) for both js and css. also, minified all css files that were not previously minified. note: you can no longer filter custom stylesheets into the plugin’s dropdown selector (no one was using this feature as far as i am aware anyway). you can still filter the stylesheet being loaded as well as indicate the path of a custom stylesheet. added recaptcha v3 support. added default membership product(s) at registration. added membership product(s) for user export. added support for selecting fields to display on the registration form or the profile form. added wpmem_activate_user() and wpmem_deactivate_user() to user api. added wpmem_user_sets_password() api function. added wpmem_get_block_setting() api function. added wpmem_set_user_status() api function. added wpmem_export_users() as api function (function already existed, but the original has been moved to an object class, and the function has been included in the api). added wpmem_sanitize_field() api function. this is a general utility that allows for different sanitization by type. added wpmem_maybe_unserialize() api function. if result is serialized, it unserializes to an array, if an array, it sanitizes using wpmem_sanitize_array(). added wpmem_get_user_role() api function. added wpmem_get_user_ip() api function. added wpmem_get_user_meta() api function. added wpmem_get_user_products() api function. added wpmem_user_has_meta filter. added wpmem_login_form_settings filter. added wpmem_block_settings filter. added wpmem_msg_settings filter. added wpmem_sc_product_access_denied filter. added wpmem_views_users filter. added wpmem_dialogs filter. added wpmem_query_where filter. added wpmem_user_action. added admin user class for handling users > all users screen and user activation. added user export class. added “msg” attribute support for [wpmem_logged_in] when using the “membership” or “product” attributes. replaced wpmem_version constant with $wpmem->version. replaced wpmem_path constant with $wpmem->path. wpmem_path will still function for backward compatibility. replaced wpmem_url constant with $wpmem->url. new folder structure being implemented all admin js & css now load from /assets/ not /admin/ !!! other improvements changed load for wp-members admin api so that emails, dialogs, and tabs only load on the wp-members settings screens (where they are used). changed email “from” to only load if the wp-members email object is doing a send (user or admin). this saves an option load when not needed. fixed an issue where a php notice was thrown if one of the user pages (login/register/profile) was deleted but the setting not updated. fixes the php notice issue, but also adds an admin notice to indicate the page was deleted, but the setting not updated. (this also adds a new admin notice function/process that can be expanded on later.) fixed an issue with wpmem_user_has_access() that prevented proper results when used to check a specific user id (other than the current user). 3.2.9 load jquery ui and select2 libraries locally (if they have not already been enqueued). use (local) template file for default tos field link (can be customized and saved in theme folder). added new sanitization functions to api: wpmem_sanitize_class() and wpmem_sanitize_array(). review and cleanup of form data sanitization. improved file/image field upload file
