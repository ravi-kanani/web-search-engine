(it sounds a whole lot more dangerous than it actually was!) you must take a look at some of the fun owen and i had with this set. (this is a link to our instagram highlight of stem at home, so click until you get to the ward’s science photos!) these guys were a riot playing with the materials from this set. we all did. again, check out our instagram highlight of stem at home, so you can see some videos of our experience! from the site: interactive energy tubes are ideal for teaching students about open and closed circuits, conductors versus insulators, and light and sound waves. when you hold both ends of the energy tube, your body becomes the conducting material. the gap between the two metal electrodes on the tube is bridged and your body creates a closed circuit. the result is that the energy tube produces sound and red, green, and blue led lights flash. engage the entire class using the students as “wires”. elevate this lesson by incorporating the included simple circuits kit and testing student-generated circuit diagrams. this kit includes enough materials to engage everyone in the classroom- just hold hands. ward’s® essentials magnetic slime kit with a slime-lover in our house, this activity is bound to be a head-turner. especially because slime is all the rage right now, i think students of all ages will absolutely love getting their hands into some magnetic slime! from the site: this inquiry activity takes exploration of solids and liquids a step further by challenging students to formulate and test magnetic slime. students observe physical properties of “pure” substances and track properties as they create various mixtures. students synthesize their results and create a recipe for the “perfect” magnetic slime. ward’s® essentials spacesuit design challenge i think when we opened this set, we all had a blast just playing with the materials. it’s been ages since i held a “water worm”, and the “space worms” are who students actually try to build a spacesuit for! from the site: with this activity, students are presented with a defined set of materials and asked to design a spacesuit that can help maintain the body temperature of an astronaut in the extreme heat and cold of outer space. water-filled “space worms” are used as test subjects that mimic the water composition of the adult human body. students must create a budget and plan their testing rounds accordingly. students collect data on internal temperature changes of the space worms and evaluate which suits work best given the economic constraints. how incredibly fun would this be?! ward’s® essentials crawling color, walking water the crawling color, walking water set was super cool, and i can just imagine how students will respond to this activity. the colors and movement will get them talking for days. (in a good way–about science–i mean!) from the site: this high-quality acrylic display allows the classroom to explore color mixing and the properties of water, including cohesion, adhesion, and capillary action. students take their knowledge a step further by engineering a plant model and mapping capillary action through the “xylem.” this kit includes enough materials for 15 student groups. ward’s science grants and funding services rocks. have you ever tried to write a grant, friend? grant writing is no joke. it’s laborious. it’s time-consuming. it’s absolutely exhausting. but unfortunately, for many teachers, it’s the only way they can secure materials or experiences for their students. i love that ward’s science has a whole crew available to help people with grant-writing and funding. ward’s science wants to help and offers: step-by-step support for all your science and technology funding needs one-on-one partnership with an expert ward’s science grant consultant proven success – over $5 million secured since 2012 they’ve helped over 1,000 educators win science and technology funding – and we can help you too!
