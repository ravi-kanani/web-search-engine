great. february 9, 2020 9:58am / reply erin says... yep! my thoughts exactly. but i do. every morning. because i love him and his bizarre need/desire/whatever to tell me. february 10, 2020 7:48pm / china hoffman says... love these – for me and my husband replace the bananas with scrambled eggs! he always makes them the way i like them :) february 7, 2020 4:38pm / reply erin says... my husband takes out half the bacon from the oven and then cooks the other half a little more for me <3 february 10, 2020 7:51pm / sb says... bringing home snacks from the grocery store even when i said i didn’t want one (because they know that i always want snacks). february 7, 2020 4:09pm / reply shila soni says... this was the sweetest. only eating half of the ice cream sample tugged at my heart because i do that with my husband. and it always makes me feel loved when he laughs at my bad jokes. loved this illustration, thank you brooke and cup of jo! february 7, 2020 3:48pm / reply dawn says... i’d edit that dream one to say, “pretending to listen to details of a dream they had”. february 7, 2020 3:46pm / reply joanna goddard says... hahaha february 7, 2020 4:24pm / dana says... my dreams are so bazaar. one morning, still half in dreamland, i started describing my latest dream to my husband. he opened the notes section of his phone and started typing what i was saying. he said – you have to tell this story. so for national novel writing month that year, i sketched the whole thing out. someday i’m going to publish a book that could easily have been a forgotten dream. that’s love to me. february 7, 2020 3:44pm / reply amy says... aw, i love these! so many are spot-on, even in their specificity. february 7, 2020 3:39pm / reply wendy says... my sweet husband always gives me his free sample @ see’s candies. i am a very lucky woman! february 7, 2020 3:35pm / reply angela says... these are great! may i add- listening to “work talk” , taking out the recycling/compost on my own recognizance and visiting with in-laws without your spouse/partner/significant other. my favorite way to show my love is leaving a fresh towel and washcloth set out for my husband. february 7, 2020 3:25pm / reply judy says... i agree with all of these except the dream one. my husband used to love describing his dreams to me in the most long-winded way and, as they are dreams, there was never a ‘point’. they went on and on until he would inevitably notice i wasn’t listening with rapt attention and he’d get offended. i love him and there are many things i’d do for that man… but i draw the line there. any loved one that doesn’t share the ice cream sample is a monster. february 7, 2020 2:31pm / reply sheila says... seriously. who doesn’t share the ice cream sample? they always seem to give a huge sample. it’s just good manners to share it. it’s a sample. i will say, my kids are pissed when i insist on tasting their sample. 😂 february 7, 2020 9:30pm / allie says... my husband has always given me the booth side at restaurants for the 17+years we’ve been together. i just assumed that it was because he preferred the chair. one night we were eating with friends and i was talking about what a perfect couple we are because we each get the seat we want in restaurants and he laughed and told me that of course he prefers the booth, but always gives it to me because he knows how much i love it. heart emoji x 10. february 7, 2020 2:01pm / reply caitlin says... every single one of these is love. february 7, 2020 2:00pm / reply jm says... giving them the booth side at the restaurant – always february 7, 2020 1:50pm / reply agnès says... that’s my husband! bringing me a cup of tea in silence, when i’m writing <3 february 7, 2020 1:20pm / reply lauren e. says... i don’t know why but this totally made me teary. i’d add agreeing to call monopoly a tie. february 7, 2020 1:02pm / reply sb says... people want the booth side? my husband says he loves me by taking the booth side! february 7, 2020 1:01pm / reply allie says... sounds like your husband loves you very much – he’s playing the long con;) february 7, 2020 2:14pm / rosie says... traditional etiquette is that the man sits facing the wall so he isn’t distracted by the room and can focus on his date. he is also supposed to pull the table out to make it easy for you (us?) to sit down. it’s one of those things that i don’t care if i guy does it, but i always notice if he knows that he is supposed to sit on the outside. same with the guy walking on the outside. when i walk the dog with my brother-in-law, he always walks on the outside, and it’s this cute basic chivalry that i really enjoy for some reason. probably because, as a lesbian, i so rarely encounter that dynamic in my own home. february 7, 2020 3:17pm / azuresong says... regarding walking on the street side, i agree that’s chivalrous except if it’s night and there are a lot of homeless people in doorways. then, please let me walk on the street side! february 7, 2020 4:46pm / cs says... actually, i don’t really love booths, either… and not does my husband. whenever possible, we just try to get a normal table and chairs. february 7, 2020 5:29pm / anne says... omg, “looking at all their childhood photos with them” is so specific and spot-on. it’s something i don’t always have the patience for even with the people i love most, but i know how meaningful it is to them so i try my best. i don’t know why this is so hard for me to do! for me, this is up there with listening to other people’s dreams. february 7, 2020 12:59pm / reply hannah says... one of my favorite ways to say “i love you” is to wait in the driveway until the person i’ve dropped off has made it safely inside their house. i don’t think i’ve ever needed to stay, everyone always gets inside, but it makes me feel better knowing that everyone is home safe and sound. february 7, 2020 12:31pm / reply caitlin says... same! everyone in my family does that-i think it’s the nicest gesture :) february 7, 2020 3:15pm / kate says... yes, i love that! february 7, 2020 5:18pm / hh says... yes, and waving from the window (or front porch) when the person leaving leaves… even if they’re just running an errand! this is something my immediate family started doing unconsciously, i think, when my sister and i were small children, after the tragic and untimely death of our uncle. you never know if that will be the last time you see them, so waving is like saying “i love you; come home safe.” if i find myself pausing in the doorway and waving as my date leaves, i know i must really care for him. february 8, 2020 11:06pm / sydni jackson says... giving up the booth & the last fry are definitely sacrifices made for love <3 february 7, 2020 12:02pm / reply jo says... the dream one is hilarious and oh-so-real 👀 february 7, 2020 11:54am / reply jane says... ooo the banana one is astute. february 7, 2020 11:49am / reply amy says... the dream one made me lol. a true mark of love! february 7, 2020 11:46am / reply cancel reply comment name email website notify me of follow-up comments by email. about / contact joanna goddard brighten up your inbox let’s hang out contact me design most popular my sister’s home makeover 8 awesome podcasts john derian lives in a sea captain’s house behind the scenes: making a magazine cover what’s the most beautiful thing you’ve ever read?
