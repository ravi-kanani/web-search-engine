partners we are very grateful to collaborate with a range of talented people and companies who share our vision and are resolved to help us achieve it. these relationships are near and dear to us. it’s a thrill to introduce you to them here. some partners are our top-recommended software platforms for online entrepreneurs. we think of these fine companies as our smartbar partners, companies that don’t only provide an amazing tool but also link arms with us to provide valuable subject matter education and technical skill training on their tools to our community members. other partners are service professionals who specialize in a unique ability that we lack in-house. we think of these awesome persons and agencies as our force multipliers that magnify what we’re able to do and accomplish by ourselves. our partners smart bar partner smart bar partner smart bar partner smart bar partner email marketing partner convertkit is the only email marketing platform we use, and will ever use. convertkit is our number one recommended email marketing platform because it has been thoughtfully built to the exact needs of creators building online businesses. their entire user experience is gorgeous and user-friendly. segmenting our subscribers into focused groups so that we can deliver content specific to their needs has never been easier. and automating email sequences to ensure the right emails get sent in the right order is a breeze. we also love just how simple it is to integrate convertkit with other software tools we rely on, such as teachable and rightmessage. such integrations have become essential to supporting our community members with individual situations. needless to say, we’re all-in on convertkit. view convertkit $ this is an affiliate link pat and team have been a huge part of our growth at convertkit. convertkit would look very different without pat's impact and we are so thankful to work alongside him to help creators earn a living.“ nathan barry, , convertkit founder & ceo back to top course platform partner offering online courses to our audience revolutionized our business a few years ago, and teachable made that possible. teachable is a market leader in the booming online courses industry. all of our online courses are housed on teachable because they make it so darn simple to configure content, manage settings, and sell to students. better still, there’s absolutely no coding required to set up and start selling your online course with teachable. and their new page editor makes building and customizing your course’s design elements easier than ever. oh, and if you have affiliates for your online courses like we do, then you’ll fall deeper in love with teachable because they handle all of the heavy-lifting for you such as calculating and executing payouts to affiliates. view teachable $ this is an affiliate link we've been working with pat and the rest of the spi team for over three years now and, simply put, they are one of the biggest reasons we are here today.“ ankur nagpal, , teachable founder & ceo back to top segmentation partner we wanted to better understand our audience and better tailor their experience with our products, and rightmessage helped us do that. rightmessage is a pioneer in segmentation and personalizing users' experiences on any website site. in a few short questions, visitors to our site can specify the information they want, and rightmessage is able to give it to them. we are sensitive to the privacy of our audience, so we appreciate that rightmessage can individualize content based on information our audience provides to us, rather than through tracking them across the internet. and rightmessage makes setup easy and allows us to ask exactly the right questions. and if you're a convertkit user, the integration with convertkit is seamless, which makes it even easier to get users exactly the content they want. we are all for tools that make our lives simpler and our users' lives better, so we love rightmessage. view rightmessage $ this is an affiliate link over a year ago, we started working with pat and the spi team to help them better segment their audience. that has grown into a fantastic relationship, including contributing to the smartbar at flynncon and having our teams work side-by-side.” brennan dunn, , rightmessage founder & ceo back to
