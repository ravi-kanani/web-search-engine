when choosing a web hosting plan, there are several aspects you'll want to consider. your level of tech-savviness, your budget, and how you expect your site to grow in terms of traffic should all be taken into account. if you're less comfortable with technology, our wordpress or web hosting plans are our most popular options, whereas savvier customers expecting high traffic numbers may potentially want to go with a dedicated server. do i need both a web hosting plan and a domain? yes. you need both web hosting and a domain in order for your website to be accessible online. without a domain name, you would need to direct visitors to a string of numbers known as an ip address. your web host provides the server that hosts the files for your website. the domain name is the connection between your ip address and the web hosting server. you can register a domain along with any of hostgator's hosting plans, or you can transfer a domain you already own. what if i already have a website? can i transfer my existing website to hostgator? definitely. you can transfer your site over yourself, or take advantage of our free content migrations for all new accounts or upgraded accounts that require a server move. we also offer free domain name registry transfers. see https://www.hostgator.com/moving for more information. am i stuck in a contract? no. new customers on our web, reseller, vps, and wordpress hosting plans are eligible for our 45-day money-back guarantee. although we never like saying goodbye, we try to make the cancellation process as simple as possible. after you request cancellation, it can take up to 72 hours for us to verify and close your account. until that time, or unless you request otherwise, your account will be cancelled on your next renewal date and will no longer be accessible. cancelling your web hosting has no affect on your domain registration. how long will it take to get set up? we'll get you set up as quickly as possible, but setup time does depend on your chosen plan. for new web, cloud, and wordpress hosting customers with new domains, your server will be set up and ready for you within an hour. if you're transferring a domain over to us, this process can take longer, and for those customers purchasing dedicated servers, it can take up to 24 hours for the provisioning to complete. can i switch or upgrade plans? absolutely! you can upgrade or downgrade your hosting plan at any time. there is no contract involved and no fee to upgrade. is email included? unlike many web hosts, we're proud to offer unlimited email addresses for free with all of our plans. our web-based email clients are designed to make email management and forwarding easy. you can also seamlessly upgrade to google apps for as low as $5/mo. what does "unmetered" mean? diskspace and bandwidth are unmetered for all of our plans, which means you are not charged according to how much you use. however, we expect customers to utilize the amount of disk space and bandwidth necessary for the normal operation of a personal or business website. in the very rare case that you come close to exceeding this amount, you will receive an email from us. when purchasing web hosting, what else do i need to keep my site safe and secure? here at hostgator we care about the success and security of your websites so we provide you with the tools and services you need to run a marketable, safe, and secure website. we feature all of the essentials that you need to keep your site safe and secure protect your site from hackers (powered by sitelock) hackalert is a monitoring service that checks your website daily and immediately notifies you if your website has been hacked or injected with malicious code. backup your hard work (powered by codeguard) get a time machine for your website! codeguard protects your website with a daily automatic backup. assure your customers that your site is secure (powered by ssl certificate) ssl certificates assure your customers and visitors that any data (credit cards, passwords etc) they enter on your site is secure and protected. earn the trust of your visitors and convert them into customers. what if i have more questions?
