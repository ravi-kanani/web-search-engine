to be honest, iâ€™m quite happy about the fact that i donâ€™t have to take the tube anymore â€“ itâ€™s even more of a nightmare when youâ€™re pregnant! and, at least i can wake up and work in my pyjamas too. iâ€™ve never worked from home and i donâ€™t know what itâ€™s going to be like, but i didnâ€™t really have another choice to make money, so i was going to have to suck it up either way. so, i have been experiencing some embarrassing symptoms lately. i now have the opposite of constipation! itâ€™s probably down to the frequent weetabix and fruit breakfasts iâ€™m having, but i have about a thirty-second warning before i need to be by a loo. and, thank goodness iâ€™m not working with other people now because i would feel very bad for them being around me right nowâ€¦ i also have quite a bit of gas issues. my back has started to ache, probably because of the weight of the baby, but i donâ€™t care now because i finally felt boxer kick! i had felt flutters before, but now i definitely feel him, even though itâ€™s not super strong yet. i tried to get hubby to feel the kicks but he said he wasnâ€™t able to feel anything yet. oh well, in good time, iâ€™m sure he will. iâ€™ve also enlisted hubby in a part-time job â€“ foot and back massages â€“ and it has really helped with the back pain. i know that reflexology plays a part in helping with backaches, but ahhhh, i didnâ€™t realise how much like heaven it felt to have your feet and back rubbed! i could get used to this extra special treatment. ðŸ™‚ a fun fact â€“ the baby measures the length of a carrot â€“ about 27cm from head to heel and around 360g. your baby at 21 weeks your baby weighs more than your placenta! your babyâ€™s sense of smell and taste is developing now your babyâ€™s bones are forming and they are kicking about and flexing their muscles. your little one is getting an idea of the flavour of foods that you eat, by swallowing a little of your amniotic fluid. theyâ€™ll soon get a taste for the food too! your baby is still covered in waxy vernix to protect their delicate skin from the amniotic fluid your baby is peeing and drinking it too â€“ what a nice thought (!) your baby has started to make its first poo which is called meconium your babyâ€™s facial features are also continuing to develop. their lips are now more defined and their eyebrows are growing thicker. if your baby is a girl, she already has her lifetimeâ€™s supply of eggs in her womb â€“ about six million of them! if youâ€™re having a boy, his testes are still in his abdomen but will start to drop in the coming weeks once the scrotum is developed. your pregnancy signs and symptoms have you been suffering from leg cramps? almost every mum-to-be does! massage your legs and flex your feet, as well as gentle exercise and drinking more fluids will help. elevate your feet when you can as well. you may well start to feel your flutters turning into kicks and jabs now. you may start to notice a pattern in the kicks too. your bump is definitely growing now and people will be able to see that youâ€™re pregnant you may be experiencing nosebleeds, sore breasts and thrush. talk to your midwife or doctor if you are worried about your pregnancy symptoms if youâ€™re suffering from heartburn or indigestion, avoid spicy or greasy foods, as these could trigger the burn! have you started to experience braxton hicks contractions yet? these are little tightenings in your belly as your uterus practices for labour. you may start to experience leaky boobs too. your milk ducts will be fully developed by the end of the second trimester. next steps book a babymoon break with your partner as this may be your last relaxing trip alone! if your baby becomes less active, speak to your gp or midwife straight away. have you chosen a baby name yet? note: these are just general ideas of how you and your baby are getting on. donâ€™t forget that every baby develops differently. if you are concerned about your babyâ€™s development, please consult your doctor or midwife. leyla preston (594 posts) leyla preston is the owner and editor of motherhood diaries global magazine for parents. leyla is a busy mother of two even busier boys; aron, 8, and aidan, 7. when leyla isnâ€™t feeding, managing a gazillion tasks or cleaning the infinite mess at home, she is busy working on this magazine and a new cooking channel coming very soon â€“ no rest for the wicked!you can follow leyla on twitter (@m_diaries) or join the busy motherhood diaries facebook group where all mums get together and share stories and solutions with one another: https://www.facebook.com//groups/motherhooddiaries/ tags:backachedietdigestionemploymentfinancesgasjobmassagemoneypregnancypregnantweek 21 related posts how the gender mystery during pregnancy ... 18 weeks pregnant- on holiday and loving... mystery shopping and motherhood 33 weeks pregnant â€“ itâ€™s my ... are electronic cigarettes a suitable alt... how to keep your style during maternity 7 fun ways to teach kids about saving en... aronâ€™s birth story aidanâ€™s birth story thinking of having a baby?
