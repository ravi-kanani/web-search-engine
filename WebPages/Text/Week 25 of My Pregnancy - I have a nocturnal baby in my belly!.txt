can you read this legal charge? are they right to charge us this much in solicitor‚Äôs fees!?‚Äù i wonder if we will complete by 22 september now ‚Äì it seems to be taking everyone a long time to change names on the legal documents. i am determined to think positively about the whole process though. it‚Äôll all get done in time, i‚Äôm sure‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm still waiting for strong cravings to hit me. i wonder whether this incredibly strong sweet tooth i‚Äôve gained during this pregnancy is a craving or a product of my low energy (even though i am nowhere near as tired as i was in the first trimester.) my bump is growing nicely too. i definitely look pregnant and people are now offering me seats on the bus which is nice. i am now firmly part of the pregnancy group! üôÇ a fun fact ‚Äì the baby weighs approximately 1.5 pounds and is about 13.7 inches long! s/he is growing fast the science part your baby at 25 weeks your baby weighs the same as a cauliflower! you are probably feeling your baby a bit more now. touch and rub your belly now to remind your baby that you‚Äôre there can you see your baby‚Äôs hands and feet on your bump now? you may be able to feel a few hiccups too! your baby is packing on the baby fat now their wrinkled skin is starting to smooth out your baby is also growing more hair. their senses are heightening too and they can see the difference between light and dark they are also listening to you and the family when they are talking. your pregnancy signs and symptoms your uterus is now the size of a football, so you may be feeling strange when moving around. are you still getting leg cramps? unfortunately, it‚Äôs a common side effect symptom. if cramps are happening at night, try taking a warm bath before bed. your ankles may be swelling, make sure you‚Äôre elevating your feet and avoid wearing tight shoes. if you have swelling in your face or hands, then check with your docotr. you may be noticing thicker and glossier hair ‚Äì thanks to your pregnancy hormones, your normally shedding hair is sticking around. you may also have more hair on your face, breast and belly. do a patch test on your skin before you shave, wax or remove your hair with cream as your skin is senstive during pregnancy. your hormones are all over the place, if you‚Äôre feeling down, loko after yourself and ask for help if you need it. your next steps pregnancy pilates can strengthen your back and pelvic floor ‚Äì it‚Äôs super important to keep these strong for bright keep up the exercise as it will keep you healthy and it feels good too! keep up the fluids, especially drinking water. make sure you listen to your body and stop exercising if you feel dizzy. speak to your gp if you are concerned. get the family to chat, read or sing to the baby, as it‚Äôs a great way to bond. the combo of hormones and belly stretching may leave you feeling uncomfortable. make sure to continue moisturising to prevent or reduce stretch marks and if have itchy skin, talk to your midwife/gp to rule out obstetric cholestasis. note: these are just general ideas of how you and your baby are getting on. don‚Äôt forget that every baby develops differently. if you are concerned about your baby‚Äôs development, please consult your doctor or midwife. *illustrations by charlotte watkins.
