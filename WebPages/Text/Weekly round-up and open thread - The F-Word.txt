(meehan crist, the london review of books) from the article: having a child is at once the most intimate, irrational thing a person can do, prompted by desires so deep we hardly know where to look for their wellsprings, and an unavoidably political act that increasingly requires one to confront not only the complex biopolitics of pregnancy and birth, but also the intersecting legacies of colonialism, racism and patriarchy, all while trying to wrap one’s head around the relationship between the impossible extremes of the personal and the global. why is british media so transphobic? (edie miller, the outline) i have begun to see people who obsess about their weight as part of their lifestyle as a class of their own (marisa meltzer, the cut) [book excerpt] unpacking the twitter bullying involving the director of guns akimbo (jessica mason, the mary sue) older women are needlessly going blind. why isn’t it a national scandal?
