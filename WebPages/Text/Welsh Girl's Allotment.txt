welsh girl's allotment hello world,(a bit ambitious as only my mam knows i am here yet !) this is my blog detailing my quest for an allotment, its cultivation and hopefully bountiful crops. please feel free to leave comments, even if it is only a hello !!! friday, january 29, 2010 i finally got to visit the plot today, it wasn't quite as bad as i had imagined. this is how it looked when i left - after i had hail, snow, sleet, rain and freezing wind i surrendered and legged it back home - almost a complete usable plot whoo hoo !!! full length shot after i stopped - fair bit of work to do on this plot !! the plan is go down in the morning and dig over the grassy strip at the top, however the forecast is for a heavy frost tonight so we will have see when i get up ! these two are the before shots, sprouts are looking miserable and all the bean poles are still in place - all gone now. posted by welsh girls allotment @ 9:27 pm 1 comments sunday, january 17, 2010 any brave souls out there ? its been a while since i've been to the plot, i have been since the last blog post ... honestly .. but things have become a little grim over the winter so this week i will attempt to get down there any survey the damage !! anybody brave enough to come with me - it won't be pretty ! posted by welsh girls allotment @ 10:55 pm 0 comments wednesday, may 06, 2009 raspberries tidied up the raspberries - these are the autumn variety that my dad gave me last year - starting to look good !! posted by welsh girls allotment @ 10:44 pm 5 comments look very hard .... .... and you will see teeny sprouts and caulis - you won't see the lettuce, spring onions and beetroot seeds i put in between the two rows of sprouts - hopefull you'll see them soon !! posted by welsh girls allotment @ 10:35 pm 0 comments hoe hoe hoe !! onions, shallots and garlic all hoed and looking neater. posted by welsh girls allotment @ 10:31 pm 0 comments forced rhubarb my cunning plan of forcing the rhubarb worked well - and this is the result was lovely - rhubarb crumble yum yum !! posted by welsh girls allotment @ 10:26 pm 1 comments strawberries the annual rescue the strawberries mission can be deemed a success. the weeds are loving spring - does anybody have any ideas what i can do with the supersized dock leaves ?
