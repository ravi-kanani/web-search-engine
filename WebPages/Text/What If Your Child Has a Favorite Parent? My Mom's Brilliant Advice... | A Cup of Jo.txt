(zoinks!) and after birthing him and everything! i immediately turned to my own mom and sent her this email: anton said tonight, ‘mommy, is it okay if i tell you that daddy is my favorite parent? i just love him a little bit more.’ i laughed and said, ‘of course it’s okay; you loved me the most when you were a baby, so now it’s daddy’s turn!’ i’m mostly feeling okay about it. but i am still a little bit sad! my mom, who is a sage in all ways, wrote me back this amazing note: here’s an answer that is probably longer than you want!! lol!!! it is okay. and it doesn’t actually mean he loves you less. anton would be devastated if he thought you didn’t love him or were disappointed or upset with him. the very fact that he could confide that to you means he feels safe and secure with you and trusts that you love him! he was making sure that you were okay with him being obsessed with alex right now because your opinion matters. he was asking for your okay. he is just really saying that alex is his role model right now. that does not mean that you aren’t the one he wants or loves more when he gets hurt or if someone is mean to him at school. he wants alex’s approval right now and knows he has yours. anton got permission from his rock that he can share his feelings and scamper off and have fun with daddy and not feel guilty or risk your not loving him. you showed him you love and accept him as he is. how great is that advice? i thought might be helpful for other parents, too, in case you find yourself in this funny situation! p.s. my sister’s awesome dating tip, and six words to say to your child.

(hopefully i keep it in mind when my son inevitably says the same thing to me…. :)) march 26, 2020 5:21pm / julee says... wow, your mom is basically a guru after that wonderful wisdom. it wasn’t too long of an answer, at least not for me, thanks, joanna’s mom! march 18, 2020 7:23pm / reply gemma says... i had not realised how much i needed to read that right now. having a bumpy time with my 9 year old, we are 1 year in since his dad left. most days i feel like a real crappy parent and breaking the amazing relationship me and my son always had. so thanks xoxo march 18, 2020 6:19pm / reply maggie says... will your mom adopt me?! wow! march 18, 2020 5:12pm / reply marie says... i love whenever you share your mom’s advice. she is so good!!!!! thanks for sharing! march 18, 2020 5:12pm / reply lucia says... joanna, thank you for sharing this! this topic has been part of my google search lately and unfortunately my relationship with my mom is nowhere close to yours so i did not bother to ask for her advice, or even tell he about this issue. i have a 9- month old and 2 years and 9 month old and after having the baby back in june, my older one got very attached to my husband and considers him his primary parent. on the one hand it made it easier for me to be with the baby especially during those awful early breastfeeding days, on the other hand it made me feel inadequate and failed as a mother – whose child screams for his dad when he sees his mother? i have been trying to be around as much as i can, having special times with him, but he told me the other day straight to my face he does not like me, but he likes papa. i am trying to be positive, and i am mostly, but damn, after 2 miscarriages and an ivf this really stinks. (p.s. baby still loves me. at least for now) march 18, 2020 2:28pm / reply karen says... a similar thing happened to me – it’s so hard! it took me a while to show myself some grace and know that my older child still loves me. this time is so hard for everyone – lack of sleep, getting used to a new member of the family – and for a toddler who doesn’t know how to process emotions, it can be extra confusing! those special times you’re having with your son will pay off. it helped me to remember that love isn’t finite – our kids can love both parents differently and the love won’t run out if one is a favourite right now! sending hugs. you got this. march 21, 2020 11:18pm / jessica says... your mom is a friggin’ parenting rockstar. march 18, 2020 2:23pm / reply sarah says... tearing up at what your sweet mom wrote, to you and all of us parents! march 18, 2020 1:38pm / reply ky says... oh my word, your mum is a wise woman! loved this post. march 18, 2020 7:05am / reply ana says... your mom is a professional genius. march 18, 2020 6:12am / reply molly says... i’ve got to comment because my almost 10 year old son told me this same thing a few weeks ago – that he loves daddy more. i was crushed. i’m a stay at home mom & we’re really close but my husband & younger son are very similar & i think that they are really bonding over everything sports right now. he knew after he said it that i was taken aback & i wish i had hidden my reaction sooner. i think he feels bad about saying it but i don’t want to go back now & bring it up. wish i had read your mom’s advise before! it’s spot on! march 18, 2020 2:15am / reply eliza says... best post ever. march 17, 2020 10:47pm / reply le says... as the mom of a two-year-old who i sometimes wonder if would miss me if i got swallowed by a whale, this helped. i’ll have to reread it each time i hear “shoo, mommy! daddy time!” (seriously.) thank you. :) march 17, 2020 10:07pm / reply andrea says... awwwwww. i love this post so much. march 17, 2020 8:37pm / reply sandra says... omg can i adopt your mom? march 17, 2020 8:14pm / reply jennifer says... so… um… will we have that “ask your mom” advice series anytime soon??? i think i’ve been waiting for like six years… :) march 17, 2020 4:26pm / reply cl says... second this, omg. thought i was the only one! march 17, 2020 5:06pm / j says... yes!!! march 17, 2020 7:25pm / melanie says... same! march 17, 2020 7:39pm / nikka says... same! your mom should respond to reader questions in a casual “email just from me to you” form. xoxo march 17, 2020 7:48pm / melissa says... lovely post. i agree, let’s hear more from your mom! march 18, 2020 11:24am / heather says... love this!! march 17, 2020 2:24pm / reply maria hannigan says... your mom is awesome. that is some 100% therapist level advice. you’re lucky joanna! march 17, 2020 2:04pm / reply simone says... well, consider me melted. such a beautiful perspective! march 17, 2020 1:37pm / reply elli says... i needed this! march 17, 2020 1:27pm / reply myrna says... joanna, thank you for sharing this ‘milestone moment’ with your readers, and like most of the other commenters, i agree that your mom’s advice was absolutely brilliant! this made me reflect that the whole notion of human minds (and hearts) making comparisons and rankings of how much love is coming our way is sometimes so annoying. i know that we can’t help it—it’s just an aspect of how we, as human beings, process all kinds of inputs. i’m blathering on a bit, but sometimes i wish that we/i could be more accepting of every drop of love we get and be happy when the people we love (especially our children) have enough love to share with others. march 17, 2020 12:50pm / reply m says... treasure your mom. she sounds amazing <3 march 17, 2020 12:46pm / reply cynthia says... awesome advice! march 17, 2020 12:41pm / reply adina pestroiu says... that is an amazing response! your mom is totally awesome :) march 17, 2020 12:20pm / reply pat martin says... wow. march 17, 2020 12:20pm / reply ← older comments cancel reply comment name email website notify me of follow-up comments by email. about / contact joanna goddard brighten up your inbox let’s hang out contact me motherhood most popular trying out slow parenting best of: parenting around the world how did you know you were ready to have a baby?
