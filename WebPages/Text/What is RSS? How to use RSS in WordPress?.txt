if no, what’s the best approach to stop others from stealing my content in the future? any help would be appreciated. reply wpbeginner support says: feb 17, 2017 at 9:00 pm hi lisa, first, you need to go to settings » reading page and scroll down to option ‘for each article in a feed, show’ and then select ‘summary’. don’t forget to click on save changes button. now rss feed will only show a summary of your article and if someone is stealing your content through rss feed they will only get the summary. next if you are using yoast seo then go to seo > advanced > rss and then add content to put after each item in your rss feed. by default yoast seo will add a link back to your own site. this way content scrappers will be forced to link back to original article. reply jessica thomson says: nov 23, 2016 at 3:18 am thanks for the article i just want to confirm that through rss feed it also easy for search engine to understand your site easily or just it is good for users point of view ? reply steven denger says: sep 20, 2016 at 12:34 am hello – great post – i have been trying to work out a problem getting my rss feed to show uip in readers. i already read wp beginners posts on this. my site is the latest version of wordpress.org and is created by using just pages. since the wordpress rss just displays posts, i installed the “improved include rss” to include pages in the feed. but it seems there is a problem. i have tried 4-5 readers and none of them will display any content from my feed. it just comes up “no content”. when i use a validator to check these feed url’s, each time it comes up with a “404” – not found. i am totally lost now and i am beginning to think i will never have an rss feed that can be useable. any suggestions? thanks for your time, steven reply wpbeginner support says: sep 20, 2016 at 2:33 pm see our tutorial on how to add custom post types to your main rss feed. your pages are also a post type and you can add them using the code snippet in the article. pages post type is called page. reply rebeca says: aug 24, 2016 at 1:52 am hello, i have a problem. i’m trying to use my feed in mailchimp but it says that it is not useful. i have verified my feed and the page says that the problem is that there is a blanc space in line 1, before an xml text, you can see the document here: i cannot add my feed in mailchimp due to that blanc space and i don’t know how to quit it. could you help me?

 replace example.com with your own domain name. also replace /wp-content/uploads/your-rss-feed-icon.png with the rss feed icon you want to use. you can upload the icon by visiting media » add new. hope this helps. reply kerrie redgate says: nov 23, 2015 at 4:51 am thank you! reply pam says: jan 30, 2016 at 1:16 pm i am so lost. i am non-techy and then some. i’m trying to figure out the rss feed thing and add the rss icon, but i don’t know where to go or what to add. reply gaurav singh says: oct 20, 2015 at 10:27 pm hello everyone, a problem with not followed feed links is showing in my google webmaster tool and if i going to open mysite.com/feed then nothing showing. please help me… reply matt says: sep 27, 2015 at 6:47 pm hello, this is usefull article, but i still have an issue. is there a way to block certan twitter user from being subscribed to my blog feed? this guy pretends to be me, and my posts are automatically posted on his twitter. how can i protect myself from such people?
