(every day? once a week?) and i also need a niche. i would like a lifestyle blog that i can blog about being a military wife with a job and everything that is going on in my life etc, which can include almost everything. but i don’t want to seem too scattered at the same time. i would also want to create new content that is engaging! help! 🙂 reply anya skrba august 23, 2019 at 9:23 am hey sarah, i think it’s great that you want to start a blog! i like the idea of a lifestyle blog – we have a great guide that can lead you through the entire process of starting a lifestyle blog (with a few great examples of lifestyle blogs you can find inspiration from)! or we can do it for you for free – if you’re interested in that write to use at hello@firstsiteguide.com regarding your question about content creation – you need to know that this is going to be your blog, which means you decide how much content you want to publish and what kind of content you’re going to create! your first post should be about you – give your future readers a little introduction about yourself, your idea behind the blog, etc and later you can let the story leads you further. experiment a bit, write about different things that you find to be valuable for sharing. in the beginning, you don’t have to have a content publishing schedule – whenever you feel like writing do it and press publish. just feel free to practice – it’s your first time being a blogger, the world of blogging is a new thing for you and making mistakes is just fine! no blogger started without making mistakes and no blogger exists without making mistakes because you learn from them 🙂 your blog is your online space – you have total freedom on doing whatever you wish with it and from all of us here at firstsiteguide you have full support! 🙂 goodluck with your blog sarah, and if you need any help we’re always here for you! ps. see blogs of other military wives like the frugal navy wife, the military wife and mom, army wife 101, etc reply d hallaman august 6, 2019 at 5:22 pm this was a fantastic blog. a lot of very good information given, i had no idea what a blog was or how to start one. i will definitely use this information in the very near future. i have saved this link and will return in a couple of months, when i need to build my first blog. thank you for the information. reply maddie w. july 24, 2019 at 5:49 am hi, thank you for the useful tips on how to start a blog. i especially agree with the sentence, “every human being has its story to tell”. blogging is a lot of work but what a great way to record your story and share with others. thank you for sharing! reply joneson july 19, 2019 at 9:56 am great post, blogging is hard. we run a travel blog and i think the most important thing we tell people is to travel with a purpose, do not just wander around the world aimlessly. so many travel blogs do not really have a purpose or a niche. niche is key and many miss out on that because they want to cover and do it all. do not just start a blog because you think you will get rich quick and be able to travel the world. it takes a lot of work and lots of time. reply aneesha april 10, 2019 at 2:05 am it is a very useful article……now i’m gonna create a blog. reply ogi djuraskovic april 12, 2019 at 12:53 pm good luck aneesha!
