blogging & how it works (simple guide) alex nerney updated: 3/16/20 ‚Ä¢ comments: 36 home ¬ª create and go blog ¬ª blogging basics ¬ª what is a blog? blogging & how it works (simple guide) disclosure: this page contains affiliate links, meaning we receive a commission if you decide to make a purchase through our links, but this is at no additional cost to you. please read our disclosure for more info. facebook0 tweet0 pin432 shares432 if you‚Äôre confused about what is a blog, how it works, and if this is something you would want to do ‚Äì you‚Äôve come to the right place! this breakdown is going to explain everything. two years ago, lauren and i were in the same place that many of you are probably in right now. we honestly didn‚Äôt know the difference between a blog and a website. it was all new and kind of confusing to us. we actually didn‚Äôt really identify with the term ‚Äúbloggers‚Äù for the first several months. we just thought that we had a health and fitness website we were trying to make money from. despite our confusion, we were eager to get started blogging because we saw how much money other people were making online and how effective it was to grow a business. fast forward to today, lauren and i have built two six-figure blogs and make over $100,000 a month blogging! it‚Äôs a crazy but very true story, and many people now even call us ‚Äúexpert bloggers‚Äù and ‚Äúprofessional bloggers.‚Äù i don‚Äôt know when that happened, but i do feel like we can give a very solid and tangible definition to the common questions surrounding what a blog really is: table of contents close open what is a blog? what does ‚Äúblog‚Äù stand for? what is blogging? what is a blog used for? what is the difference between a blog and a website? what should i blog about? what makes a good blog? what kind of blogs are there? what kind of blog should i start? how do you make an income from a blog? how do i get started? what is a blog? the standard definition of a blog is something like this one from dictionary.com: ‚Äúa website containing a writer‚Äôs or group of writers‚Äô own experiences, observations, opinions, etc., and often having images and links to other websites.‚Äù yawn. so formal. so official. and so incredibly boring. let‚Äôs instead illustrate with an example: this is a blog. what you are reading right now is an article on a blog. it‚Äôs just written content (generally meant to instruct or be informational in nature) on a website. the blog itself is what holds the content in the post (what you‚Äôre reading) and in our case, and our blog is a part of our entire website. this is also why we refer to our website as a blog. for all of you preferred video learners out there, here is a video of this topic (plus some extra tips!) from our youtube channel below. what does ‚Äúblog‚Äù stand for? what does blog mean? in computer terms, ‚Äúblog‚Äù is the combination of two words ‚Äì ‚Äúweb‚Äù and ‚Äúlog.‚Äù web + log = blog üôÇ what is blogging? again, dictionary.com would say, ‚Äúto maintain or add new entries to a blog‚Äù very thrilling. the much more interesting truth is that blogging is an incredibly fun and mentally charging form of creative expression. it‚Äôs taking your unique thoughts and your unique writing style and mashing those two things together in the form of written expression. blog writing really can be introspective, fun, exciting, mind-numbing, emotional, relaxed, or whatever you decide for it to be. there is also no requirement on how often you update your content. you can blog once a week or you can blog once a year. it‚Äôs completely up to you. what is a blog used for? it‚Äôs up to you! blogs can be used for any or all of the following purposes: personal journals (hobby blogs) creative expression teaching and coaching others selling products promoting brands it can be whatever you want it to be. in our case, we use our blogs to teach others as well as to sell products to make a full-time income online. what is the difference between a blog and a website? i‚Äôm more of a visual learner myself so let‚Äôs show you some examples. the following are three types of websites and how they function with blogs: the website is a blog. the website has a blog. and the website is just a website. let‚Äôs dive into a little more detail on each one and explain what the differences are. the website is a blog the best example of a blog we can give is the website you are on right now, createandgo.com. pretty much our entire website is a blog. this is also how our first health and wellness blog worked as well: it is primarily a blog because it‚Äôs centered around updated content on the website. here are some other names you could classify our blogs as: blog website (because even if it is a blog, it‚Äôs is still technically a website) authority/niche website (because the content is centered around a specific topic, this is also acceptable. you might not have ever heard of this term, but it‚Äôs common in internet marketing speak.) other examples of websites in which the primary content is articles are huffington post and buzzfeed. while these are much bigger websites publishing lots of content and may refer to themselves as a website or publisher, they are still technically a blog since blogging is their primary content. in these cases, both terms are acceptable. the website has a blog i think this is why so many people get confused. in this example, the website has a blog it uses, but the primary content is not articles. this is the case for most websites as a blog is a good way to drive traffic to your blog and potential customers to a website. the email marketing service, convertkit, is a good example. you can see on the top menu that they have a link to their blog: the website has a blog with regularly updated posts and it‚Äôs an important part of their business, but the blog section is not the primary content or purpose of the website. the primary purpose is getting people started with their email marketing software. they sell software. in this case, the people at convertkit would likely refer to their site as‚Ä¶ a website a software a business they would not refer to what they do as ‚Äúblogging‚Äù or being ‚Äúbloggers‚Äù even though they have do have a blog on their website. another example is wifitribe.co, which is the group of remote workers that we have traveled with in the past. they too have a blog, but the primary purpose of their website is to get digital nomads to go together on trips around the world ‚Äì many of which we have been on! convertkit is mainly selling a service. they don‚Äôt consider themselves ‚Äúbloggers.‚Äù remember, the primary purpose of the website is going to usually reflect what the creator calls the website. it is subjective in nature but is all about what the purpose of the website is. the website is just a website in this case, the website exists without a blog as a standalone site. an example would be canva.com. this is a standalone website with no blog that we use to create and edit images. more examples include websites generally for: apartment complexes local real estate brokers platforms like youtube and facebook any of the above websites could add a blog to their website, but right now they just have a website. alright, i hope that cleared some stuff up. next, i want to go over some other important questions you probably have if you are interested in learning about what is a blog and more about the basics of blogging. what should i blog about? what to blog about is going to depend on your own goals for your blog. contrary to popular belief, blogs are not just an online diary about your thoughts. if you want to make a business out of it, you need to run it like a business. remember that it can be whatever you want to make of it. you can blog about whatever your heart desires, including‚Ä¶ company updates a product you liked a workout you used or recommend to your friends or use it as‚Ä¶ a creative outlet to practice writing a way to meet others and connect basically, anything you can think of. be creative! here‚Äôs the rub though‚Ä¶ not all articles are created equal and there are certain blog post ideas that do better than others. what makes a good blog? it‚Äôs the connection you create with your readers. the closer you can connect with and bond with those visiting your blog, the more powerful the blog will be and likely money you will make. a good blog is not necessarily a big blog with a large audience, more so it‚Äôs how many members of that audience truly connect with the writer/content. some small blogs make tons of cash because of the deep connection with their audience, while some huge blogs make nothing because they don‚Äôt know how to connect with readers. what kind of blogs are there? there are many different kinds but they usually fall into 4 categories: lifestyle/personal brand blog passion subject blog broad niche blog crash-test-dummy blog a lifestyle blog and a personal blog are generally the same thing. they leverage the personal brand of someone‚Äôs name and are usually more about that person‚Äôs lifestyle. many bloggers take this path and people have even gotten very famous from blogging. another kind of blog is microblogging where someone blogs in short note-style posts. this is usually done on a platform like instagram where you write longer captions (not recommended if you want to make serious dollars though). what kind of blog should i start? everyone‚Äôs personality and desires are different when it comes to blogging. that‚Äôs why we recommend everyone take our blogger personality quiz to help you determine this. it‚Äôs completely free and an awesome way to get started blogging! how do you make an income from a blog? you can make money in a variety of ways. some methods will earn you much more money and some will earn you money much faster. some of the very basic ways to make money with a blog include: putting ads on your blog (google adsense) recommending products in your articles (like amazon products) selling other people‚Äôs products (called affiliate marketing) selling your own digital products and services (higher return but more time investment) so, you can get paid by companies whose products you are recommending or directly by people who purchase your products. how do i get started? you can get one started in 30 minutes or less! if you‚Äôre ready to get rolling make sure to check out our post on how to start a blog (a step-by-step beginner‚Äôs guide). p.s. did this post on what is a blog help you?
