january 6, 2020 by hair romance 1 comment when it comes to hair treatments hair oils can be quite confusing as products. but if you’ve tried hair oils and they haven’t worked, it might because you’re not using them the right way. alternatively, it might be because you haven’t found the right hair oil for you or it’s one that’s not right for your hair’s needs. to help with this dilemma, i’m answering some questions about when you should use hair oils in your hair routine and what types of oils are best for your hair. i’ll also be exploring oils that are actually oil blends and whether these are okay too. you can check out my video on hair oils that’s part of my hair q&a series, which is all here on my hair romance channel. when should i use hair oils? click here if you can’t see the video above. when to use hair oils oils can nourish your hair, but remember that oil and water don’t mix, so if you want to moisturise your hair, you need to add water first and then seal it in with oil. it might seem counterintuitive, but adding water to the treatment is often a step that’s left out and it’s one that makes all the difference to the end result. the key is to to hydrate your hair first and then capture that with oil. if you have fine hair, you can still use a hair oil treatment without your hair ending up limp and lank from too much oil. the trick for fine hair is to do an oil treatment before you shampoo. this way, you won’t have a heavy residue in your hair from the oil, but you’ll still get a beautiful scalp and hair treatment. head massages when you’re giving yourself a head and scalp massage, this is a great time to use hair oils. you can use any natural oil for this, it just depends on your hair. i find heavier oils like coconut oil are too much and i need to shampoo them out at the end. i prefer to use light almond oil or jojoba oil, which is light enough to leave in your hair, especially if your hair is dry. add some shine oils are a great way to add shine to your hair and you only need a couple of drops to do this. once you’re happy with the finished style, mix one or two drops of oils in your hands and smooth it over your hair. you cna twist it through your curls to highlight them too. less is more when adding oil to dry hair. and note that while hair oil can smooth down some flyaways, too much oil just makes your frizz shiny too. what if i’ve used too much oil in my hair? if you have time, it’s probably best to pop in the shower, shampoo your hair and start again. but if you need a quick fix, here’s what you do: i recommend using a little dry shampoo or hair powder. going with a matte powder product will help absorb some of the excess oil in your hair and put some body back into your hair that’s feeling a bit weighed down by the oil. then you can quickly restyle and you’re good to go. it may not feel the nicest, but it will look a lot better and get you through an over-oiled bad hair day in minutes. what about oil blends? hair oils had a real moment when moroccanoil launched their argan oil, and every brand followed them. although labelled as an oil, these are oil blends, usually with a base of silicones. if you follow the curly girl method, these are ones to avoid but if you use shampoo, they’re easily washed out and they can perform very well to smooth and add shine. i wouldn’t use an oil blend for head massages but for styling they are a great choice. my fave hair oils & blends darshana hair oil oribe gold lust oil embrace for every curl hair and body oil schwarzkopf got2b hair oil macadamia natural oil spray do you like using oils in your hair?
