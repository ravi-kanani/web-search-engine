skip to content style bubble bubbling up since 2006 posted on 2013-12-10 by susie when in rome‚Ä¶ "i keep curiosity alive. i never say never, and never say ever. i'm open to change, to new perspectives." silvia venturini fendi i've become fairly ballsy when it comes to interviewing people. backstage in the throng of shows, i have no fear when it comes to getting a quickie quote or two. an in the flesh twitter talk with someone, who has never ever done one at a house that has only just begun ramping up their digital engagement ‚Äì that's a whole different type of interview altogether. when silvia venturini fendi agreed to take part in fendi's first ever twitter talk #fenditalks and i was asked to come to rome for a day to conduct the q&a, i jumped at the chance to return to a city, which i last visited on a school trip aged 14, more intrigued by a school trip with the local boys school than the wonders of roman architecture. that said, i was fairly petrified about guiding fendi into twitter talk territory for the first time, taking silvia venturini fendi along for the ride. turns out my fears were completely unfounded. one of the stand out answers that she gave in the quote above summed up her can-do and will-do attitude towards a digital experience that would put off most other fashion creative directors. in fact all her answers suited the 140 character requirements of twitter ‚Äì to the point, direct and no off-piste tangents. rome wasn't built in a day (yup, i'm pulling out all the rome-related sayings just for this occasion) but fendi did manage to pop their twitter talk cherry with aplomb. you can read the full conversation on fendi's twitter account, where svf talks about her love of rome, having fun with fur and the relationship between the worlds of design and fashion. as if being invited into silvia venturini fendi's office to have a twitter tete a tete wasn't enough of an experience, i was also given a whirlwind tour around fendi's closeted accessory atelier, something that has never been granted to either journalist or blogger. this is the beating heart of fendi as it were, with bags and accessories being the bread and butter of the business, and even with the expected restrictions imposed on photography, it was incredibly interesting to see a workplace where ideas for the next "it" bag gestate. silvia venturini fendi is of course instrumental in creating a hit/it bag culture at fendi, being the creator of the house's famous baguette bag. with that stroke of bag genius, the baguette is fendi's icon which has justifiably entering pop culture, anchored by memorable moments in shows like sex and the city. the hits kept on coming with the b, the spy and the peekaboo all having their moments and right now, in an unexpectedly whimsical moment, silvia venturini fendi explored the idea of fun fur and what started off as a plain fur-covered geometric cube, kind of like those fur dice car ornaments, then grew a pair of eyes and became baggie monsters or bag bugs as fendi have dubbed them. these bugs have lingered long after their a/w 13-4 and they've turned up for s/s 14, this time with swarovski eyes and the idea seems to have given fendi a freshened up angle to get a younger clientale interested in this famed house. speaking to the design team as they showed me their moodboards and the materials that they have developed in the past, at the heart of the house of fendi is technical accomplishment. it's why even the people who sit on the fence about fur (that would be me ‚Äì please see previous posts/statements about fur as i'm not going to delve into it here) can't deny the aesthetic feats that this house has achieved with a material that was previously used as a raw status symbol ‚Äì as silvia venturini fendi puts it ‚Äì "the bigger the coat, the bigger the wallet" was fur's yesteryear. combine that with the leather and exotic skins that fendi is also famed for and their cheeky interplay between real and synthetic materials, the house knows no bounds when it comes to technical prowess. marco de vincenzo, who has launched out on his own, is still a key designer in fendi's accessories atelier and he told me that silvia venturini fendi always tells them that anything is possible ‚Äì there is nothing that fendi can't have made if they push for it. for the pre-fall 2014 collection, they play with the idea of contrasting the animalistic with something superficial, something that marries well with the bug eye motif that peek out with furry eyebrows from a baguette bag. i loved it when silvia venturini fendi talk about being attracted to the "disgusting" things. "i love disgusting. i love it when someone at the factory says it looks disgusting," says fendi. "it means that from a mistake, you can learn something new. i love a challenge." she also admits to loving competition ‚Äì "i love it when every (label) is creating beautiful bags." it's this constant questioning of taste that keeps silvia and her team on their toes, to keep striving for something new and different. bag bugs may be riding a popularity wave right now but silvia venturini fendi isn't resting on her laurels. on the desk opposite silvia's sat a trio of leather covered squirrels ‚Äì prototype cuddly toys to accompany fendi's childrenswear, that are more than likely to get the attention of the parents as well the kids, judging by the reactions of everyone (including a very very excited me ‚Äì that's down to my sister and i playing an imaginary game called squirrels and hedgehogs when we were young and had no toys). just another curveball to add to the fendi story. they may have jumped on the digital wagon later than others but it seems that when they catch up, there's a compelling story that awaits. categoriesaccessories, designers, travel 17 replies to ‚Äúwhen in rome‚Ä¶‚Äù giaa says: 2013-12-10 at 7:06 pm oh my, this is precious! http://giaa-fashion.blogspot.pt/ reply denisa says: 2013-12-10 at 8:50 pm great post. http://www.fashiondenis.com/ reply elisa says: 2013-12-10 at 9:04 pm great! elisa ‚Äì my fantabulous world reply kiri says: 2013-12-11 at 12:28 am it‚Äôs great that you posted this so quickly after the twitter q&a. i love the photos and it‚Äôs great to see the mood boards and fabric swatches that inspired the current range. i love the playful nature of the bag bugs and you are right re the fur and people overcoming it for these cute little critters. for me, in australia, it‚Äôs not that i don‚Äôt agree with fur, it‚Äôs more that it‚Äôs not cold enough to need it so i don‚Äôt think about purchasing it. these bugs are a cute way to own a little bit of the pie. x kiri http://www.fashionblender.com.au http://www.facebook.com/fashionblender reply rachel says: 2013-12-11 at 12:35 am this is so cool, like rockndolls.co.uk reply wows says: 2013-12-11 at 7:37 am those bags are awesome! kisses from http://www.withorwithoutshoes.com today i bring you a very comfy outfit with a maxi turtleneck sweater and marant style boots reply julie says: 2013-12-11 at 12:28 pm great post üôÇ xx http://www.filleamaman.com/ reply dinabella says: 2013-12-11 at 2:15 pm oh.. wow‚Äö√§¬∂ this is really cool!!! reply mimi says: 2013-12-17 at 5:34 am so cute bag bugs! reply leonseid says: 2013-12-18 at 6:51 pm you are interested by the world of cloths and fashion, we have a very chick collection, please feel free to visit us at: http://www.ifapparel.com/ reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website post navigation previous postprevious meadham kirchhoff remixed next postnext this is me‚Ä¶ bidding farewell to n7 categories categories select category accessories art beautiful people beauty books designers diy editorials film history london music new buys news random rants and raves shoes shop watch shopping streetstyle susie styles television travel trends uncategorized vintage archives archives select month june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 january 2018 december 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 march 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 proudly powered by wordpress
