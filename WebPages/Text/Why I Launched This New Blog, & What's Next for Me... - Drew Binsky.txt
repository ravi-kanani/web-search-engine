on my new site, you’ll find a more simplified, professional and personal space dedicated to sharing my lifestyle, tips and insights as i travel around the world. from day 1, my ultimate goal from blogging & posting on social media has been the same — to influence and inspire millennials to travel. the content on drewbinsky.com will focus on a few categories: social media advice (tips for how i’ve gained 200k+ followers, how-to guides, etc.) snapchat vlog (i have a page where you can watch all of my snapchat stories) budgeting on the road (how i manage to spend about $50usd day on travel) tips for how i’ve made traveling into a career sharing my best travel stories and experiences showcasing all my media attention (tv interviews, podcasts, guest blogging, etc) in other words, i am moving away from writing posts like “the top 10 cities to get f*cked up in,” and i am moving towards providing quality advice for how to help you travel and/or make a living out of traveling the world. i want to be the person that high schoolers and college students look up to when they need some motivation or advice to travel. i want to be that person who shows how fulfilling and rewarding it is to meet people and explore different places in the world. and that’s my motivation behind spending 3-4 hours every single day responding to people’s emails, snapchats, tweets, instagram messages, facebook comments, blog comments and questions. i am here to help you get on the right track. but what about thehungrypartier.com? i have decided to turn the hungry partier into a communal site, with dozens of regular contributors, focused on providing the best nightlife guides around the world. i have previously published about 20 nightlife guides in various cities around the world from my own partying experiences, and many of these posts (including the seoul and prague nightlife guides) are the most viewed articles i’ve ever written. so i thought it’s a good idea to expand on the content that people are reading – which is nightlife guides. please contact me if you’d like to be a writer for the hungry partier! if you have any knowledge about partying in a particular city (bars, clubs, etc) that i haven’t covered (check here), then i’d love to have you contribute. as part of the deal, i will include a link to your website and shout out your social media handles. for all the other blog posts i’ve written on the hungry partier — they will remain the same. it’s not worth my time and effort to migrate hundreds of my old posts into my new site. maybe i’ll rewrite a few old posts, but i want a fresh slate for new content ahead! i am super excited to start this new chapter and share some exclusive travel advice with you guys! free postcard giveaway to celebrate the birth of my new blog, i am sending out 5 free postcards from machu picchu to people who sign up for my email list (on this link). i will write a personal message on it and ship it to any country on earth. winners will be randomly selected and announced in exactly 3 days. postcard winners: tom jasiniski kim wesely c. mason kelsea vickhouse sam chong and lastly, i invite you to join my adventures on snapchat (@drewbinsky) if you haven’t already. i will be snapping from all over south america and the caribbean islands until october – including #rio2016! thanks again for reading 🙂 drew binsky about latest posts drew binsky a graduate from the university of wisconsin-madison, drew binsky has visited 190+ countries since 2012.he first caught the travel bug while studying abroad in prague, then taught english in korea, and now he's on a mission to visit every country on earth.follow his journey on youtube & instagram @drewbinsky 🙂 latest posts by drew binsky (see all) my 2018 recap: 35 new countries visited - january 3, 2019 iran is not what you think!! - july 3, 2018 join us on a group trip to thailand (nov ’18) - may 22, 2018 posted in blogging, travel post navigation top 10 favorite cities on earth my experience at machu picchu 37 thoughts on “why i launched this new blog, & what’s next for me…” hans says: february 27, 2020 at 3:58 am i am young and have not had the opportunity to travel out of the country. i will be this march though. thanks for inspiring me. when i get older, i hope to travel as much as possible thanks to you. 😉 reply ranjitha s says: august 5, 2019 at 4:52 am hey drew…..you are doing awesome work but why didn’t you published a blog on cambodia?

or have you found a way to export story’s and keep the integrity of the photos (ie and not have the frame freeze). any advice on how to best export the stories (that include both video and photo) would be awesome! thanks reply drew binsky says: july 28, 2016 at 1:15 am thanks, lillian! yes, i removed the photos because they don’t export correctly, and it’s a huge pain in the butt to edit them. so it’s just videos! reply jessica says: july 27, 2016 at 2:26 am good for you! congrats and can’t wait to learn a thing or two!! reply drew binsky says: july 28, 2016 at 1:14 am thanks! reply caz makepeace says: july 26, 2016 at 11:45 pm great decision drew! evolution is so natural and many people are afraid to drop the old them and embrace the new. it would have been a hard choice given all the energy and resources you invested into the old site. i too was confused after following your snaps and then seeing your blog. it didn’t feel like it was the right fit. and i love how you’re turning that into a communal site – so many people love to share their party stories. we’ve lived a somewhat similar life working in other countries teaching. i think you have a lot of value you can share to help others do the same. i’m looking forward to following your new direction. reply drew binsky says: july 28, 2016 at 1:14 am thank you so much for the kind words, caz! i also enjoy following your snaps and your blog, and it’s nice to hear that we have similar stories! i hope that our travels cross paths sometime in the near future – it would be an honor to meet you! take care 🙂 drew reply jeniffer diaz says: july 26, 2016 at 10:41 pm i love this blog! thank you so much! i pretty much enjoyed the readings 🙂 reply drew binsky says: july 28, 2016 at 1:13 am thanks jennifer! reply jen says: july 26, 2016 at 10:17 pm this is really inspiring to be honest reading about how you matured thought that was kinda funny when you said that! but your life is full of adventures that not only you deserve but it’s what you were born for! it’s your gift! it’s crazy i never knew you end to korea to be an english teacher! and it’s pretty amazing! because english teachers are amazing teachers! i’ll be waiting for tips in my email! from you! god bless you and have safe travels! reply drew binsky says: july 28, 2016 at 1:13 am thanks jen 🙂 i had a great experience teaching in korea, and that’s what led me to where i am now! reply evelina utterdahl says: july 26, 2016 at 7:09 pm i actually started following you on snapchat first about 6 months ago and when i realized the name of your blog i felt a bit confused, to me it didn’t reflect what i had seen of you, so this feels like a very wise and natural step 🙂 going to be fun following you here as well! reply drew binsky says: july 28, 2016 at 1:12 am thanks for the comment, evelina! cheers! reply patrick says: july 26, 2016 at 2:29 pm great to know drew. i respect your decision a lot and knowing when to move on. good luck with future endeavors. reply drew binsky says: july 28, 2016 at 1:11 am thanks so much, patrick! reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment * name * email * website recent posts my 2018 recap: 35 new countries visitedjanuary 3, 2019 iran is not what you think!!july 3, 2018 join us on a group trip to thailand (nov ’18)may 22, 2018 best places to visit in summer 2018may 12, 2018 highlights from a 6 day road trip in floridaapril 3, 2018 most popular posts why i launched this new blog, & what’s next for me… how i afford to travel full-time teaching english in korea 25 best travel tips i’ve picked up from 80+ countries list of all countries i’ve eaten mcdonald’s at (and why) ask me anything! please leave this field empty.
