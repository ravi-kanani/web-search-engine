luka doncic 2018 panini prizm this probably rivals my hot-take above with lebron, as one of my best picks or the giannis rookie card that i talked about as well last fall. luka was very obvious to me as an all-time potential player. he’s proven that this season in his sophomore year. i think a lot more people believe now and because of that it’s gone up from $55 (the price i bought at) to over $300. it’s tough to 6x your money in almost any way in life. that’s why i’m excited about sports cards. i’d be shocked if luka doesn’t go to $1000. stunned, i’ll probably start buying more soon. 1986 fleer basketball hakeem olajuwon i think the ’86-’87 legends, ’86-’87 fleer rookies are going to continue to go up in price. i think hakeem is an all-time top twenty player. i’m betting on this card super long. i think africa is gonna have a very interesting kind of half-century. i’m looking forward to being an old man and sitting on these when they’re $2,000, $3000 a piece. 2013 giannis antetokounmpo panini prizm i famously made the mistake of selling 10 of these for $200 or so on my instagram stories. after i bought them for $120 – $130, i was buying them up heavily at $180. now, they’re going for around $2000. that’s over a 10x return on investment. and let’s call a spade a spade – it is wildly likely that giannis wins the title in the next 36 months, and when he does the sky’s the limit, not to mention this man is wildly, is just incredibly charismatic and a good dude, and one of the clear front-runners to be the next face in the nba. if you’ve got money and you don’t need to liquidate it, one of the best places to put your money is old basketball cards. cards like dr. j, kareem, jordan, barkley, larry bird and magic rookies – i think basketball for the next 20 years will grow in popularity, and i think basketball cards are underpriced. i’m desperately interested in 5 – 15 people who read this article to go hardcore, rekindle their childhood passion, or use their sports betting knowledge to make real money! share #business check this out #business share how to make 64 pieces of content in a day 4 months ago · 2 min read in my continued efforts to bring the most value to the entrepreneurs, operators, and marketers of the world, today on my 44th birthday, i’m releasing a deck that the team and i have worked on extensively over the last couple of months. ... read more >> subscribe for access to exclusive content. lorem ipsum dolor test× subscribe must read the rise of audio branding feb 03, 2019 read now >> must read the top 20 podcasts from the garyvee audio experience sep 21, 2018 read now >> upcoming events may 05 integrity events presents – gary vaynerchuk london, uk info may 05 the sasha group’s digital discovery+ deep dive london, uk info may 07 social media week new york new york, ny info jun 12 e2 summit park city, ut info get notifications × × gary vaynerchuk home blog podcast events garyvee search engine recent press books hire me to speak my story press kit first time here wallpapers keep in touch lorem ipsum dolor test× get all my best stuff in your inbox. subscribe ©gary vee ip, llc 2018 privacy policy | terms of use × ×
