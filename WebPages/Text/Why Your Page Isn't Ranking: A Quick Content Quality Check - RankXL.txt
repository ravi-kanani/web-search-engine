authority seo 2.0 blog about tools contact why your page isn’t ranking: a quick content quality check by chris lee 26 comments last updated on: october 20, 2018 let’s do an honest analysis of your content. i receive at least a dozen emails each month from people frustrated that their article isn’t ranking on the first page of google for their keyword. they claim they’re doing “everything right” but nothing seems to be working. it doesn’t take long to see what their problem is. apart from lack of strong backlinks, 9 times out of 10, they’re simply not creating content that’s good enough to be ranking. want to really get good at producing content that ranks? pay attention to these 5 things. 1. do you have the keyword in your title? let’s start off really, really simple. i feel like this is a given and i shouldn’t have to mention this, but a surprising amount of blogs fail to do it. i don’t care if you’re one of those people who purposely ignore seo. having the keyword in your title is far too important to not pay attention to. you must have your primary keyword in the title in some way if you want to rank highly for it. i’ve seen blogs with monstrous backlink profiles and huge domain authorities miss out on a boatload of free search traffic because they neglected to do this. here’s an example: a blog will write an amazing article about a topic like parenting. with a meaty article and a high backlink profile and strong authority, they should be ranking on the first page. however, they’ll title the page something like: “some thoughts on a sunday afternoon.” … from an seo’s perspective, that’s crazy! i mean i guess it can make sense to the reader. but even just changing it to something like “some thoughts on parenting” would make a big difference. i see this kind of thing too often when i’m doing niche research (having the homepage titled as “home” is probably the most common one). even if you hate seo and have no intention of learning what it is, you’ve at least got to pay attention to your title tag. also read: copy wikipedia’s onsite seo strategy for higher rankings 2. are your articles full of unnecessary filler content? this is by far the biggest reason i have such a hard time finding long-term writers: unnecessary filler content. even expensive writers have this problem, and it’s a huge pain in the behind. every time i order a longer article of 2000 to 3000 words from a writer i’ve never worked with, i will end up having to cut 30% to 40% of it. it’s full of unnecessary information and add-on sentences. it may be just because i’m really picky about everything, but they’re writing about useless things just to fill up the word-count and it’s annoying as hell. how do you prevent this? if you’re outsourcing articles… the only true way around it is to find a long-term writer who understands what you’re looking for. once you do, just trust them and don’t set any strict limits on them. give them a lot of room with word count on each article (at least for the bigger, more important articles). and give them plenty of time to write it. don’t give them two days to write a 2000 word article. give them up to a week, or maybe even two if you’re not in a rush. as professional writers, they have a lot of other clients than just you. if you rush them, you’re the one who will come up on the losing end. one of the things i started doing is working directly with higher-paying writers and giving them a huge range in word count. so instead of telling them i want a 2000 word article, i’ll tell them to write between 1000 to 3000 words and that they have full control over how long the article is. you don’t have to go to this extreme for your shorter articles, but for bigger pages that are targeting important, high-value keywords, this has been working out very nicely. 3. do you know the goal of each article you’re publishing? every single article you publish, you should be able to categorize them according to your goals. for me, i’m either creating content for promotion (getting shares/backlinks), or for quick rankings. it’s one of the two every time. if it’s going to be for promotion, i’ll need to create it into a linkable asset and make sure that it’s longer and better than my competitors. these are the kinds of articles i’ll spend more time and money on to work with better writers. if it’s for quick rankings, i won’t really care as much. what do i mean by quick rankings? these are pages published to take advantage of domain authority. when i build up enough strong backlinks, i can start ranking for long-tail keywords automatically without needing to build any links directly to that page. they’ll just index on page two or three and slowly climb into the top 5 in a few weeks. sometimes, they’ll even index straight to the first page. as a result, pumping out articles can become very profitable. and i’ll start outsourcing a lot of content around 800 to 1200 words long targeting longer-tailed keywords. these are the kinds of articles i’ll spend less time and money on. usually, i’ll work with cheaper writers or just order a batch of content from iwriter or textbroker. these aren’t linkable assets. they would perform poorly if i were to use them in an outreach campaign. they’re simply created to increase organic traffic every month. 4. are all your articles under 1000 words? surprisingly, even with all the information on the web about creating long-form content, this is still a common mistake. i’m not saying that all shorter articles are bad. shorter, straight-to-the-point blog posts are better for some cases, especially for more specific keywords where the user wants a quick answer. however, having a blog where every single article is under 1000 words is usually going to be bad sign. it likely means you’re slacking off and not paying enough attention to the topics you’re writing about. bigger keywords/topics almost always require bigger pieces of content. it’s just not possible to fully cover a larger topic under 1000 words. and it’s not something people share or link to either. so if you’re wondering why your 500-word article about how to lose weight fast isn’t ranking, it’s likely because it’s thin, generic, and provides no actual value to the reader. if you need help identifying which articles should be longer, think about the search intent of the keyword/topic you’re targeting. which leads us to our next point… 5. do you think about search intent? most people don’t pay enough attention to search intent. what is the reader looking for when they search for your primary keyword and land on your article? you need to get deeper than just identifying it on a general level. ask yourself: what is the reader exactly looking for? what would make them search this keyword? what are they struggling with? what information would make them feel fully satisfied? how are they feeling when they search this keyword? happy, sad, angry, panicked? are they in a rush? are they looking for in-depth information or a quick answer? the last one is the most important, and the one where most people fail. for example, for a keyword like “how to tie a tie” people just want a quick answer. they’re likely in a rush, and just want a clear, simple answer. a giant 1000 word introduction is not going to make for a better article in this case. the entire article should be under 1000 words, probably around 500 to 800 words. but for a keyword like “how to become a plumber” people want as much information as possible. the longer the better. a 500 word article here would not work. if you want to create a resource that fully satisfies someone who searches for that kind of keyword, it should be 3000+ words long. these are the things you need to be able to recognize. understanding search intent is a skill that comes with practice. if you get good at it, your content quality on a whole will become 10x better. you’ll get a better understanding for what the bulk of the article should be about, and what it shouldn’t be about. and as a result, you’ll have lower bounce rates, longer read times, and a more satisfied experience from visitors. conclusion don’t expect to rank on the first page of google if your article doesn’t deserve to be there. ask yourself if your page answers the reader’s question completely and in the best way. it takes a lot of work to create great content. it’s not just about having the longest article. if you can clearly understand your page’s goal, and the search intent of the keyword you’re targeting, you’ll be much better at planning out what kind of content will be best suited for it. you’ll get better on-site engagement metrics, pick up more links and shares, and develop a stronger following of readers who appreciate the resources you’ve published. facebook twitter pinterest you might also like... let’s find a profitable niche together (live walkthrough) what to look for when buying an affiliate website how to create effective website content templates to scale article production 26 comments reply karan february 19, 2018 at 8:13 am hey chris. nice read… thanks for such detailed post. reply chris lee february 19, 2018 at 5:54 pm thanks for checking it out! reply edson february 19, 2018 at 11:35 am hi chris, thanks for another post. can you show us how to get at least one backlink. please reply chris lee february 19, 2018 at 5:55 pm check out some of my link building guides. latest one can be found here: https://www.rankxl.com/outreach-link-building/ reply edson february 19, 2018 at 11:58 pm thanks chris.. reply patricia february 19, 2018 at 10:47 pm thanks chris lee. i have been a long subsriber of your weekly blog post. thanks once again for this wonderful article. this is the right time for me, as am building a website which i want to rank long on google. reply chris lee february 20, 2018 at 12:38 pm glad you liked it, patricia 🙂 reply sreenivas february 20, 2018 at 2:52 am hey chris, useful information.how long do you think it takes to start seeing the exact ranking of your keyword after you publish the article? reply chris lee february 20, 2018 at 12:38 pm it depends. if it’s a fairly new blog with few links, it’ll take longer. if it’s an established blog with lots of links, it can index within a day. from what i’ve seen, exact rankings won’t show up until a few weeks after, as it tends to move around a bit after indexing. reply bhuboy february 21, 2018 at 12:07 am this is another great and helpful post chris and also a reminder on the basics the we sometimes forgot. thanks for this reply chris lee february 21, 2018 at 12:51 pm thanks bhuboy! reply adeniyi march 3, 2018 at 3:33 pm hi chris, thanks for the informative post. it will help me write great content for my niche blog. reply chris lee march 3, 2018 at 9:20 pm thanks for reading! reply tarik march 14, 2018 at 12:23 pm you know, i haven’t really thought so much about search intent but now i’m understanding why certain articles are ranking better than others. most of my best performing articles in the travel niche are long form articles targeting a long tail keyword. they cover a niche topic in a broad sense. they also are evergreen and still get traffic years after publishing them. pushing out the shorter articles around 500 words just isn’t getting great results. in fact, i’ve tracked my roi on long form and it’s high. the problem is investing the resources to consistently pump out long articles. one tip i can suggest is tracking your adsense + affiliate earnings based on page then reinvest your resources into creating more pages like those. rinse and repeat. reply chris lee march 15, 2018 at 8:59 pm really like the tip about checking earnings to see what type of content to invest more into! thanks tarik. reply tony march 24, 2018 at 8:26 pm hello chris, i have just discovered your blog couple of weeks ago and i am happy to say that i have been reading and learning from it. sometimes spend hours. your contents are great and mind-blowing. i am planning to start my own blog soon and you have been a really helpful with your posts. keep it up man and stay blessed. reply chris lee march 27, 2018 at 3:46 pm thanks a lot, tony! really appreciate that 🙂 reply azeem april 7, 2018 at 4:13 pm this part is really new for me ” are they looking for in-depth information or a quick answer?” thanks reply chris lee april 23, 2018 at 11:54 pm cool! reply jennifer wilson may 20, 2018 at 4:29 pm this is quite an eye-opener and i am glad i read this post because it has taught me all that i have been doing wrong on my website. thanks for sharing such an amazing article. reply chris lee june 19, 2018 at 9:06 am glad it was helpful, jennifer 🙂 reply taufii july 27, 2018 at 7:19 pm amazing. i’ll practice it to my blog. reply asan october 3, 2018 at 5:15 am hi chris. nice info for being patient while build a blog. i need to know what your first consideration about choose a niche for your new blog to build. reply chris lee october 3, 2018 at 5:45 pm for beginners, it should be more about interest. for me, it’s more about market size nowadays. reply daniel dan may 10, 2019 at 11:42 am yeah. sometimes google would index me to the second or third page and it sometimes climbs to 1st page in a shortwhile. i’ve noticed that too. but once i have enough authority, i get index to first page straight and mostly in the top spot. reply daniel july 10, 2019 at 5:29 am i almost spend an hour on your blog reading your articles, i might say you really did a great job, my blog is only 4 months old, but sometimes i get 400 visits a day and sometimes it reduce to 60 a day and that traffic is from bing and google, i don’t know what’s still going on leave a reply cancel reply zero to 100k with seo a free 5-part seo email course that will show you step-by-step how to grow traffic from zero to 100,000 visitors per month (with search). sign up for free zero to 100k with seo a free 5-part seo email course that will show you step-by-step how to grow traffic from zero to 100,000 visitors per month (with search). sign me up © 2019 rankxl. all rights reserved. | contact | twitter zero to 100k with seo free 5-part mini-course. enter your email to get lesson #1. email* send me the first lesson enter your email below to get the zero to 100k mini-course email* send me the first lesson
