both were briefly imprisoned, but were released without trial. hewer managed to become very rich.[3] he made much of it through his involvement in trading with his uncle blackborne, who became secretary to the admiralty, and later secretary to the british east india company.[4] like pepys, hewer also received payments from those doing business with the navy, but suspicions of illicit payments were never proved and he did not hold a lucrative office for any length of time. he probably also inherited from his father, who was a merchant, as pepys' diary mentions his increased expenditures after his father's death in 1665. by 1674, hewer was wealthy enough to finance the construction of three warships. he became a director of the old east india company in 1698 and served two terms as its deputy chairman. he also served as treasurer of tangier. .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#f9f9f9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:0.5em 1.4em 0.8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:0.5em 0 0.8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{margin:0.5em auto 0.8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft p,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright p{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{background-color:#f9f9f9;text-align:center;font-size:larger;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:"times new roman",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:" “ ";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:"times new roman",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:" ” ";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:360px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{min-width:100%;margin:0 0 0.8em!important;float:none!important}} my wife told me how she had moved to w. hewer the business of my sister for a wife to him, which he received with mighty acknowledgements, as she says, above anything;

[7] subsequently, lawsuits arose over the immense hewer estate.[8][9] in 1684 william hewer was admitted to the freedom of the clothworkers' company, and was immediately sworn in as a member of the court of assistants. he was elected master of the clothworkers' company for the 1686–87 year. in 1687 he donated a barge to the clothworkers' company. it seems that he did not attend a single court meeting during his mastership.
