[1] abigail williams brouncker never married, but lived for many years with the actress abigail williams (much to pepys' disgust) and left most of his property to her. she was the daughter of sir henry clere (died 1622), first and last of the clere baronets, and the estranged wife of john williams, otherwise cromwell, second son of sir oliver cromwell, and first cousin to the renowned oliver cromwell. she and john had a son and a daughter. the fire of 1673 which destroyed the royal navy office started in her private closet: this is unlikely to have improved her relations with samuel pepys, whose private apartments were also destroyed in the blaze. on brouncker's death in 1684, his title passed to his brother henry, one of the most detested men of the era. william left him almost nothing in his will "for reasons i think not fit to mention". mathematical works his mathematical work concerned in particular the calculations of the lengths of the parabola and cycloid, and the quadrature of the hyperbola,[2] which requires approximation of the natural logarithm function by infinite series.[3] he was the first european to solve what is now known as pell's equation. he was the first in england to take interest in generalized continued fractions and, following the work of john wallis, he provided development in the generalized continued fraction of pi. brouncker's formula this formula provides a development of π/4 in a generalized continued fraction: π 4 = 1 1 + 1 2 2 + 3 2 2 + 5 2 2 + 7 2 2 + 9 2 2 + ⋱ {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{4}}={\cfrac {1}{1+{\cfrac {1^{2}}{2+{\cfrac {3^{2}}{2+{\cfrac {5^{2}}{2+{\cfrac {7^{2}}{2+{\cfrac {9^{2}}{2+\ddots }}}}}}}}}}}}} the convergents are related to the leibniz formula for pi: for instance 1 1 + 1 2 2 = 2 3 = 1 − 1 3 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1+{\frac {1^{2}}{2}}}}={\frac {2}{3}}=1-{\frac {1}{3}}} and 1 1 + 1 2 2 + 3 2 2 = 13 15 = 1 − 1 3 + 1 5 . {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1+{\frac {1^{2}}{2+{\frac {3^{2}}{2}}}}}}={\frac {13}{15}}=1-{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{5}}.} because of its slow convergence brouncker's formula is not useful for practical computations of π. brouncker's formula can also be expressed as[4] 4 π = 1 + 1 2 2 + 3 2 2 + 5 2 2 + 7 2 2 + 9 2 2 + ⋱ {\displaystyle {\frac {4}{\pi }}=1+{\cfrac {1^{2}}{2+{\cfrac {3^{2}}{2+{\cfrac {5^{2}}{2+{\cfrac {7^{2}}{2+{\cfrac {9^{2}}{2+\ddots }}}}}}}}}}} references ^ "no. 1485". the london gazette. 9 february 1679. p. 2..mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:"\"""\"""'""'"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/lock-green.svg/9px-lock-green.svg.png")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-lock-red-alt-2.svg.png")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/wikisource-logo.svg/12px-wikisource-logo.svg.png")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em} ^ w. brouncker (1667) the squaring of the hyperbola, philosophical transactions of the royal society of london, abridged edition 1809, v. i, pp 233–6, link form biodiversity heritage library ^ julian coolidge mathematics of great amateurs, chapter 11, pp. 136–46 ^ john wallis, arithmetica infinitorum, ...
