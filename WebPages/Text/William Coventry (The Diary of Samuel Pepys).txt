"i perceive," writes pepys on 23 august 1667, "sir william coventry is the man and nothing done till he comes", and on his removal in 1669 the duke of albemarle, no friendly or partial critic, declares that "nothing now would be well done." his appointment came too late to ward off the naval disaster at chatham the same year, the raid on the medway, and the national bankruptcy in 1672.[2] coventry's rising influence had been from the first the cause of increasing jealousy to the lord chancellor, clarendon, who disliked and discouraged the younger generation. coventry resented this. he became the chief mover in the successful attack on clarendon, but refused to take any part in his impeachment, although clarendon never forgave him for what he saw as coventry's betrayal. two days after clarendon's resignation (on 31 august), coventry announced his intention of terminating his connection with the navy.[2] as a principal agent in effecting clarendon's fall, he naturally acquired new power and influence, and was expected to be clarendon's successor as first minister of the crown. coventry retained merely his appointment at the treasury, and the brilliant but unscrupulous and incapable george villiers, 2nd duke of buckingham, a favourite of the king, succeeded. the relations between the two men soon became unfriendly. buckingham ridiculed sir william's steady attention to business, and was annoyed at his opposition to clarendon's impeachment. coventry rapidly lost influence and was excluded from the cabinet council. his career depended now entirely on the support of the duke of york: but ironically by bringing down clarendon, coventry had helped to weaken the influence of the duke, clarendon's son-in-law and principal defender.[2] finally, in march 1669, coventry challenged buckingham for having written a play in which sir william was ridiculed. notice of the challenge reached the authorities through the duke's second, and sir william was imprisoned in the tower on 3 march and subsequently expelled from the privy council. he was superseded in the treasury on 11 march by buckingham's favourite, sir thomas osborne, and was at last released from the tower on 21 march in disgrace. the real cause of his dismissal was the final adoption by charles of the policy of subservience to france and desertion of the netherlands and protestant interests. six weeks before coventry's fall, the conference between charles, james, arlington, clifford and arundel had taken place, which resulted a year and a half later in the treaty of dover. to such schemes sir william, with his steady hostility to france and active devotion to protestantism, was doubtless a formidable opponent. he now withdrew definitely from official life, still retaining, however, his ascendancy in the house of commons, and leading the party which condemned and criticised the reactionary and fatal policy of the government, his credit and reputation being rather enhanced than diminished by his dismissal.[3] 1670s in 1673 a pamphlet entitled england's appeal from the private cabal at whitehall to the great council of the nation by a true lover of his country went through five editions. the anonymous work was universally ascribed to sir william, and forcefully reflects his opinions on the french entanglement. in the great matter of the indulgence, while refusing to discuss the limits of prerogative and liberty, he argued that the dispensing power of the crown could not be valid during the session of parliament, and criticised the manner of the declaration while approving its ostensible object. he supported the test act, but maintained a statesmanlike moderation amidst the tide of indignation rising against the government, and refused to take part in the personal attacks upon ministers, drawing upon himself the same unpopularity as his nephew, george savile, 1st marquess of halifax, incurred later. in the same year he denounced the affiance with france.[4] he showed his appreciation for the loyalty samuel pepys had always displayed to him by vigorously supporting pepys' right to sit in the house of commons (to which he was elected in 1673), and ridiculing the claims (which were entirely unfounded) that pepys was a roman catholic. during the summer of 1674 he was again received at court. in 1675 he supported the bill to exclude roman catholics from both houses, and also the measure to close the house of commons to placemen; and he showed great activity in his opposition to the french connection, especially stigmatising the encouragement given by the government to the levying of troops for the french service. in may 1677 he voted for the dutch alliance. like most of his contemporaries he accepted the story of the popish plot in 1678. coventry several times refused the highest court appointments, and he was not included in sir w. temple's new-modelled council in april 1679.[4] 1680s in the exclusion question he favoured at first a policy of limitations, and on his nephew halifax, who on his retirement became the leader of the moderate party, he enjoined prudence and patience, and greatly regretted the violence of the opposition which eventually excited a reaction and ruined everything. he refused to stand for the new parliament, and retired to his country residence at minster lovell near witney, in oxfordshire. he died unmarried on 23 june 1686, at somerhill near tunbridge wells, where he had gone to take the waters, and was buried at penshurst, where a monument was erected to his memory at st john the baptist, penshurst. in his will he ordered his funeral to be at small expense, and left £2000 to the french protestant refugees in england, besides £3000 for the liberation of captives held by the barbary pirates in algiers. he had shortly before his death already paid for the liberation of sixty slaves. he was much beloved and respected in his family circle, his nephew, henry savile, alluding to him in affectionate terms as "our dearest uncle and incomparable friend".[4] assessment writing coventry's biography in the encyclopædia britannica, eleventh edition, philip chesney yorke stated that "though sir william coventry never filled that place in the national administration to which his merit and exceptional ability clearly entitled him, his public life together with his correspondence are sufficient to distinguish him from amongst his contemporaries as a statesman of the first rank. lord halifax obviously derived from his honoured mentor those principles of government which, by means of his own brilliant intellectual gifts, originality and imaginative insight, gained further force and influence. halifax owed to him his interest in the navy and his grasp of the necessity to a country of a powerful maritime force. he drew his antagonism to france, his religious tolerance, wider religious views but firm protestantism doubtless from the same source. sir william was the original trimmer".[4] writing to his nephew thomas thynne, 1st viscount weymouth, while denying the authorship of the character of a trimmer, he says, "i have not been ashamed to own myself to be a trimmer... one who would sit upright and not overturn the boat by swaying too much to either side." he shared the trimmers' dislike of party, urging halifax in the exclusion contest not to be thrust by the opposition of his enemies into another party, but that he keep upon a national bottom which at length will prevail. his prudence was expressed in his perpetual unwillingness to do things which he could not undo. a singular independence of spirit, a breadth of mind which refused to be contracted by party formulas, a sanity which was proof against the contagion of national delirium, were equally characteristic of uncle and nephew. sir william coventry's conceptions of statesmanship, under the guiding hand of his nephew, largely inspired the future revolution settlement, and continued to be an essential condition of english political growth and progress.[4] bibliography besides the tract already mentioned coventry was the author of a letter to dr burnet giving an account of cardinal pools secret powers... (1685). the character of a trimmer, often ascribed to him, is now known to have been written by lord halifax. notes concerning the poor, and an essay concerning the decay of rents and the remedy, are among the malet papers (hist. mss. comm. ser. 5th rep. app. 320 (a)) and add. mss. brit. mus.

in 1665, knighted and sworn a privy councillor, and, in 1667, constituted a commissioner of the treasury; but, having been forbid the court on account of his challenging the duke of buckingham, he retired into the country, nor could he subsequently be prevailed upon to accept of any official employment. burnet calls sir william coventry the best speaker in the house of commons, and “a man of the finest and best temper that belonged to the court,” and pepys never omits an opportunity of paying a tribute to his public and private worth. he died, 1686, of gout in the stomach. this text comes from a footnote on a diary entry in the 1893 edition edited by henry b. wheatley. 14 annotations ✹ vincent on 8 jun 2003 • link no adequate life of sir william coventry has been written;

in 1665, knighted and sworn a privy councillor, and, in 1667, constituted a commissioner of the treasury; but, having been forbid the court on account of his challenging the duke of buckingham, he retired into the country, nor could he subsequently be prevailed upon to accept of any official employment. burnet calls sir william coventry the best speaker in the house of commons, and "a man of the finest and best temper that belonged to the court," and pepys never omits an opportunity of paying a tribute to his public and private worth. he died, 1686, of gout in the stomach. ---wheatley, 1896. ✹ terry foreman on 28 nov 2015 • link portrait of sir william coventry by mary beale (attributed to) parliamentary art collection http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings… ✹ san diego sarah on 6 jan 2017 • link on january 7, 1663/64 we hear sir william coventry has a mistress. l&m says she has never been identified. he died a bachelor. http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/01/07/?c=540… ✹ san diego sarah on 21 mar 2020 • link sir william coventry was an active and eloquent member of parliament as well as being secretary to james, duke of york and a member of the navy board. bottom line, he seems to have come to the conclusion that chancellor hyde, earl of clarendon (james' father-in-law) was not the man for the job, and in the end wasn't able to ethically and harmoniously play his court hand, his m.p.'s hand, and his naval hand without hurting himself. his parliamentary biography is worth reading, with good quotes which explain some substories more clearly than i can: http://www.histparl.ac.uk/volume/1660-1690/member… log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 may 22 jun 25 27 28 jul 3 4 5 6 12 aug 21 23 sep 6 oct 9 15 dec 9 24 26 1661 jan 6 10 15 16 27 31 feb 4 7 mar 4 6 14 20 30 apr 15 16 20 may 7 sep 2 25 oct 19 nov 4 29 dec 29 1662 jan 29 mar 12 31 apr 7 8 12 may 8 15 jun 3 7 10 12 13 27 jul 2 8 11 15 16 17 22 29 31 aug 6 8 9 15 19 20 23 25 28 sep 1 3 4 8 9 14 18 21 29 30 oct 6 8 9 20 25 27 30 nov 20 25 27 29 dec 1 6 8 9 10 13 15 16 18 20 22 27 29 30 31 1663 jan 4 5 11 12 15 17 19 20 26 29 feb 2 7 10 14 19 21 22 23 mar 3 10 16 apr 6 15 20 27 29 may 4 9 10 14 15 23 24 25 26 27 31 jun 1 2 3 8 9 21 24 30 jul 1 4 7 10 13 15 23 27 28 30 31 aug 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 13 23 24 25 26 sep 24 30 oct 1 2 12 14 19 24 27 nov 6 14 16 23 25 28 dec 3 5 15 30 1664 jan 7 8 11 14 20 feb 2 6 9 13 15 18 20 21 22 25 26 27 mar 6 7 8 13 28 apr 4 13 14 15 16 18 19 20 23 25 27 29 may 3 11 12 18 21 22 29 31 jun 2 3 4 6 11 12 13 18 jul 7 12 14 15 16 21 23 25 27 aug 1 3 8 11 19 20 21 sep 6 17 21 24 26 oct 3 10 18 31 nov 4 8 12 14 18 21 dec 5 6 12 19 26 27 1665 jan 3 15 19 24 feb 24 27 mar 3 15 19 22 apr 17 22 29 may 19 31 jun 3 5 8 16 23 24 25 28 29 jul 5 10 12 23 27 aug 19 sep 10 18 oct 5 8 14 19 20 25 27 nov 3 6 17 21 25 dec 1 16 1666 jan 6 10 12 27 28 29 31 feb 1 2 11 12 14 16 23 25 mar 5 6 7 9 11 19 21 26 apr 22 25 may 5 6 7 8 14 16 24 28 29 30 31 jun 3 4 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 21 24 25 26 27 29 30 jul 1 6 9 10 12 13 18 19 23 25 27 28 29 30 31 aug 1 4 5 10 13 15 16 17 21 23 26 27 28 29 31 sep 4 7 8 11 14 15 17 20 22 23 24 27 29 oct 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 13 14 15 17 19 25 nov 1 2 4 8 10 15 17 18 23 25 dec 16 19 26 1667 jan 2 8 9 16 18 20 21 27 29 feb 3 4 6 13 15 17 20 22 24 26 27 mar 6 8 14 18 19 21 27 apr 1 3 4 7 10 12 15 18 20 22 24 29 may 5 6 7 8 9 11 15 17 20 21 22 27 28 29 jun 3 5 7 9 10 11 12 14 16 19 20 25 26 27 28 29 jul 3 6 13 22 25 27 28 29 aug 9 12 15 20 21 23 30 31 sep 1 2 4 8 10 11 25 oct 3 4 5 6 12 13 18 20 21 23 27 28 29 nov 1 4 6 10 15 17 26 27 dec 3 6 8 21 23 27 30 1668 jan 2 21 29 feb 13 14 17 18 19 23 26 mar 1 4 6 8 11 15 17 18 19 24 25 apr 13 16 20 24 28 29 may 4 13 19 29 jun 3 22 jul 1 2 3 4 6 8 24 aug 10 11 14 18 28 30 sep 10 21 25 28 oct 16 23 30 nov 16 25 27 dec 7 1669 jan 13 15 16 18 24 feb 5 12 14 17 19 21 mar 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 13 16 18 19 20 21 22 30 31 apr 2 11 17 28 30 may 6 7 30 latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
