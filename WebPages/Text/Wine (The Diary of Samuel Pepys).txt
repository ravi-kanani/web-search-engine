"seventeenth century: wine growing was not commercially viable until very recently, but this does not mean that vines were not planted, grown and written about. innovative landowners planted small acreages of vines from which they made wines. the reign of charles ii, (in the 1600s) which saw considerable innovation in many diverse fields also produced an interest in viticulture. the royal gardner, appropriately named john rose wrote about the growing, training and pruning of vines in a paper entitled "the english vineyard vindicated". in 1610 the renowned botanist john tradescant (after whom the tradescantia flower is named) was asked by robert cecil, the first earl of alsibury to go to flanders to search from some suitable vines for his estate at hatfield house. he established a vineyard of 20,000 vines the ollowing year and expanded this steadily. **samuel pepys** visited it in 1661 and again in 1667." source: http://www.scan.ukhelp.com/encyclopaedia/history/… ✹ neil adams on 16 jan 2004 • link burnt wine if not mulled wine, a popular winter warmer prepared by plunging a hot poker into spiced wine, then probably 'malmsey' or madeira wine that had been heat-treated on its long voyage... http://www.madeirawine.com/html/sauna01.html ✹ language hat on 30 jan 2004 • link french wine in the late 17th century: from tim unwin's wine and the vine (a scholarly history published by routledge): on 10th april 1663, samuel pepys wrote in his diary, off the exchange with sir j. cutler and mr. grant to the royall oake taverne in lombard-street... and here drank a sort of french wine called ho bryan, that hath a good and most perticular taste that i never met with. this wine was none other than that produced on the property of haut-brion in the graves, by arnaud de pontac, first president of the bordeaux parlement. three years later in 1666, arnaud de pontac sent his son to london, where he opened a restaurant, grocers and tavern named the sign of pontac's head, and here he introduced his wines to the discerning elite of london society... following the collapse of trade with england in the middle of the fifteenth century, the wine merchants of bordeaux increasingly turned to the netherlands as a market for their wines during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries... however, ...following the restoration of peace between the netherlands and spain in 1648, and the subsequent outbreak of war with france in 1672, the dutch turned to the sweet wines of portugal and southern spain... rather than those of france.... moreover, although the wines of the graves had reached london society through the activities of such enterprising men as arnaud de pontac in the 1660s, the outbreak of war between france and england... led to a crisis for the bordelais. the solution was to abandon the production of low quality wines, and to invest in specialist wine production which would bear the high costs imposed by war and customs barriers. gradually, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, more and more names of individual wine producing properties begin to appear, and despite trade restrictions... these wines found their way onto the english market.... previously, most of the wines exported from bordeaux had come from the south or east of the city, but these wines, known at the time generally as new french clarets, were from the médoc, to the north. here, on the poor quality sands and gravels, the first half of the eighteenth century saw a veritable explosion of vineyard development, as money was invested in the production of high quality wines… the new french clarets were the preserve only of the very rich, who could afford the high duties that were levied on them, and they thus became one element in the new symbolism of the rich and powerful of early eighteenth century england. ✹ vincent on 19 feb 2004 • link vineyard agriculture most of germany's vineyards owe their existence to the rhine river the outline of the wines of german wines: scroll down http://www.rollintl.com/roll/rhine.htm this guide contains 18464 german wines with description, rating and pictures,1767 producers, 654 of it with detailed http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.wein-plus.… ✹ vincent on 26 mar 2004 • link from the bottle [wot the a bottle of sack might look like];

it quickly recovers poor languishing lovers..." this was 20 years before the french claim to have made their first sparkling champagne, in a 1718 document referring to this type of wine around 1695. the essential difference between a still wine and either champagne or sparkling wine is the bubbles arise from a second fermentation taking place in the bottle. the carbon dioxide cannot escape and dissolves in the wine, to be released when the wine is drunk. the bottle is under high pressure and 16th century bottles and wooden bungs could not contain it. this did not matter to the french who kept their wine in casks, but the english liked their wine in bottles, and second fermentation caused the bottle to fail. still wines from champagne were prone to this because the wine was made in a cool climate and the initial fermentation often stopped prematurely, only to re-start in warm buildings just before consumption. however the sparkling effect improved an otherwise mediocre regional wine. the problem facing english wine coopers was how to control the process. an accidental improvement in bottle technology gave the english the lead. in 1615 admiral sir robert mansell persuaded james i to ban the use of wood-fired furnaces, forcing the use of coal. the higher temperatures from coal-fired furnaces produced a stronger glass which, coupled with the re-discovery of cork stoppers, gave the english a wine bottle capable of withstanding gas pressures produced by making the wine sparkling. mansell retired, built a glassworks, obtained a royal patent for the use of coal, and hence a monopoly on making the new glass. english wine coopers now had what they needed for the sparkling method, and in a 1662 paper to the royal society by christopher merritt entitled ‘the ordering of wines’ refers to making sparkling wine by english wine coopers as an established practice. this was 30 years before the french made their first sparkling champagne, and 70 years before the first champagne house was established. the french attribute the process to dom perignon, but the only records of his work show he spent his life trying to stop the wine fermenting in the bottle. the historical record shows the french perfected the process, and made champagne famous. the british invented it. http://www.moorlynch.com/history%20of%20english%2… ✹ san diego sarah on 19 oct 2016 • link rhenish wines -- the modern history of alsace-lorraine was largely influenced by the rivalry between french and german nationalisms. since the middle ages, france sought to attain and preserve its “natural boundaries“, which are the pyrenees to the southwest, the alps to the southeast, and the rhine river to the northeast. these strategic aims led to the absorption of territories located west of the rhine river. what is now known as alsace was progressively conquered by louis xiv in the 17th century, while lorraine was integrated in the 18th century under louis xv. in the earlier times, any wine produced in the alsace region, whether a white or a rose type (very few if any reds were produced in the area), would have been labeled and marketed as a rhenish or rhine wine. the alcohol content would have been up to 15%, due to the terrain and the method of wine making, which was more of the french method than the german method. https://timeslipsblog.wordpress.com/category/rh... ✹ san diego sarah on 1 dec 2016 • link on december 3, 1663 pepys receives a "runlett of tent" http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/12/03/ a rundlet was a seventh of a butt, or a fourteenth of a tun. at this time a tun was 252 wine gallons, so a rundlet is 252/14 -18 gallons. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_wine_cask... and tent is a spanish wine of a deep red color, with low alcoholic content, often used as a sacramental wine. tent: 1612 in halyburton's ledger (1867) 335 sackes canareis malagas maderais ... teynts and allacants. c 1645 howell lett.
