(by the way, limonov’s father was ukrainian and so was his real surname, savenko. he grew up in kharkiv/kharkov, the second-largest city in ukraine. however, he remained hostile to the ukrainian national project.) share this: facebook reddit linkedin twitter like this: like loading... category arts, politics, russia | tags: limonov “at the appropriate time, i will get involved, yes.” 0 march 21, 2020 by ak excerpts from a piece in the wall street journal published on thursday: administration and industry officials see diplomatic action as necessary to get russia and saudi arabia to back down from flooding the markets with supply… the u.s. would ask the saudis to return to their original, lower production levels before that decision… the administration could use the threat of sanctions on russia as part of its engagement with saudi arabia to assure the kingdom its rival russia won’t easily benefit from saudi cutbacks… either way, possible sanctions against russia are in the works… although the details of those possible sanctions and what russian action might trigger them weren’t available. mediocre minds think alike: “if president trump became convinced that oil prices needed propping up, he could use his sanctioning power, say, against russian exporters,” as i wrote on monday. if trump chose this route and kept his course no matter what, he could win an extra prize for himself and for the cause of american greatness. bringing down or seriously weakening a revanchist authoritarian regime in control of a large nuclear arsenal would help his re-election and guarantee him an honorable place in history. however, it seems that trump’s heart is not in it. bullying jerome powell into cutting rates is his idea of triumph. besides, large-scale sanctions against russia would be a risky move and there’s an epidemic at home to deal with. on top of this, headlines like this (thanks to sanctions, russia is cushioned from virus’s economic shocks) are starting to pop up. hopefully trump doesn’t get his advice from the new york times but i’ve seen similar nonsense elsewhere. russia’s vulnerabilities are multiplying over time. “russia is stronger thanks to the sanctions” is a meme straight out of a putinist propaganda manual. share this: facebook reddit linkedin twitter like this: like loading... category russia | tags: crude, donald trump, oil will this glut dry up anytime soon? 1 march 16, 2020 by ak how deep has the drop in oil demand been so far? how much deeper can it sink? when and how fast is it expected to recover? bloomberg quotes various authorities on this: “this global pandemic is something the world hasn’t witnessed since 1918,” said pierre andurand, who runs oil hedge fund andurand capital management llp. “i do not see how the the demand drop wouldn’t be multiples of the drop witnessed during the global financial crisis.” … andurand estimates that demand could easily drop by 10 million barrels a day in this quarter and even beyond. that’s roughly 10% of the pre-crisis demand and more than saudi arabia’s average crude production in february. it’s also close to 90% of russian crude output in february. roughly speaking (and boldly assuming no surplus in the market prior to the pandemic), if saudi arabia suddenly stopped producing, it would balance the market; if russia did the same, global inventories would start falling at a rate above 1 mmbpd. if andurand’s estimate is correct, that is. trafigura, among the world’s top-three independent oil traders, is publicly the most bearish about demand, saying that consumption could soon be contracting by close to 10 million barrels a day, or 10% of global demand, with perhaps more to come. its forecast is for a relatively short period of time, rather than a quarterly or an annual forecast. the big question remains unanswered: when will demand recover, if ever? what if it remains several million barrels per day below last year’s levels? in this scenario, if president trump became convinced that oil prices needed propping up, he could use his sanctioning power, say, against russian exporters. in the long run, the kremlin is seeking to grow russia’s market share to make it sanction-proof. in the short run, however, russia has just made itself more vulnerable to such measures. at this point they seem a purely theoretical possibility but can’t be ruled out with perfect confidence. share this: facebook reddit linkedin twitter like this: like loading... category global | tags: crude, oil “provide people with the opportunity to spend 60 days at home” 0 march 15, 2020 by ak there have only been 45 covid-19 cases in russia so far – a rather low number considering that russia does lots of business with china and the eu. inevitably, one suspects undertesting and/or underreporting. the true number of infected persons? anybody’s guess. from the moscow times: russia should enter full quarantine due to the threat of coronavirus in the country, billionaire businessman oleg deripaska wrote on his telegram channel friday. “the first step is to close all borders tomorrow, cancel all mass events and provide people with the opportunity to spend 60 days at home,” he said. his view could be self-serving – an appeal for state support for his businesses, for one – but it makes sense if taken literally. the businessman wrote that if the necessary measures are not taken to prevent the virus’ spread, the consequences would be more serious than the collapse of the soviet union in 1991. few things would please me more than the crumbling of putin’s despicable empire but i surely don’t want to perish either in the triggering tragedy or the resulting rubble. “this is not a panic, not a manifestation of the helplessness of society, but the only right decision…” even if it’s a panic, it’s a rational panic as it were. however, the kremlin has announced a plebiscite to legitimize its “constitutional coup d’état” and has scheduled the vote for april 22. now it could be brought forward a few weeks or pushed back a few months; but it could be canceled altogether as it’s not required by the constitution currently in effect. the kremlin might also try to run an online plebiscite but its legitimizing effect would probably be close to zero. share this: facebook reddit linkedin twitter like

personal attacks on corbyn and thatcher: alice thomas ellis called her [thatcher] ‘a mean little mouse bred on cheese rind and broken biscuit and the nutritionless, platitudinous parings of a grocer’s mind’. the quote comes from the birds of the air, the novel by ellis published in 1980, written no earlier than 1978. it’s an excerpt from the thoughts of one of the book’s principal characters. judging by the bits and pieces from the novel i’ve read so far, it must be a first-rate work. let’s put this quip into its rightful context: the totem of the english was a small animal – furry, stuffed and articulate. winnie the pooh vied with the queen (god trailing in the distance) for the forefront of the mind of the english middle class… even the leaders of the political parties had come to resemble little animals. on the left a little teddy; his stuffing, his credibility, leaking a little now. this must be james callaghan, leader of the labour party in 1976-80. on the right a mouse – a shop mouse, her head stuck in a yellowed meringue, a mean little mouse bred on cheese rind and broken biscuit and the nutrition-less, platitudinous parings of a grocer’s mind. this sounds like thatcher, agreed. she was elected leader of the tories in 1975. the erstwhile leader of the middle party was a fox – rather tired now – his fine brush matted and drooping, his cunning mask despondent. it’s got to be jeremy thorpe, the leader of the liberals in 1967-76. he was charged with conspiracy to murder in 1978, lost his parliament seat in 1979 but was acquitted a few weeks later. all in all, it’s much less tolerable to be compared – so derisively – to a mean little mouse rather than a teddy bear or a fox, but it’s fiction and only the unwise take offense at novels. share this: facebook

i could agree if you dropped “just.” it’s like the flu, sort of – but much deadlier and, in all likelihood, more contagious. i’ve seen the covid-19 mortality rate estimated at 2.3%, which would have implied 800 thousand deaths in the 2018-19 flu season in the us (35.5 million cases). if the r0 ratio is 2.2 for the coronavirus compared with 1.3 for the seasonal flu, then the former is 70% more contagious than the latter so we can increase the number of cases to 60 million and the number of potential fatalities to 1.4 million. the us center for disease control and prevention (cdc) estimates that less than 500 thousand people were hospitalized during the 2019-8 flu outbreak. some 10%-20% covid-19 patients develop a serious condition so one would expect at least 3.6 million people to require hospitalization in the us. around 5% – 1.8 million – would have to be placed in “critical care.” it’s way more than the american health care system can handle. it’s a like a panic bank run or demand for natural gas on an extremely cold day, only much worse, obviously. all of this seems self-evident today but it is wisdom of the hindsight. it helps understand why the chinese built the makeshift hospital in such haste and why they crippled (as it seemed) their economy through quarantines and travel bans. they had more time to estimate the contagiousness and mortality than anyone else. the downside risk was that hospitals would soon be overwhelmed, increasing mortality, and the people would rightly blame the government for failing to provide an essential service. this said, trump’s latest travel restrictions are steps in the right direction although more limitations on movement are probably necessary to slow down the spread of the virus in the us. share this: facebook

(the translation is my own): the prosecution in the mh17 crash case has claimed that at least two buk missile launchers were dispatched from russia to ukraine in 2014 but one of them broke down along the way. it never made it to the self-proclaimed donetsk people’s republic, according to the bbc. the other one did, unfortunately. it’s perhaps illustrative of the way russia works – russia, that resurgent great power – except the private sector of its economy, i should add. two anti-aircraft launchers were sent to the donetsk region to act against ukrainian war planes. one of these got stuck on the way and failed to reach its destination. the other one arrived where it was supposed to and shot down a civilian plane. perfect efficiency. of course one could argue that chaos is in the nature of hybrid wars but don’t they have an affinity with certain russian ways of doing things? share this: facebook reddit linkedin twitter like this: like loading... category history, politics, russia, ukraine | tags: mh17 if timing is everything, why the hurry? 0 march 10, 2020 by ak i’ll start by quoting myself (as of january 17, 2020): … if putin remains politically active, the new setup will let him stay in charge for as long as he wants. it could even enable him to take a less hands-on approach to governing if things go smoothly after the reshuffle. on the other hand, he would be able to assume dictatorial powers in an emergency. and here’s the latest development (as of march 10, 2020): russia’s lower chamber of parliament, the state duma, has approved a constitutional amendment that would allow president vladimir putin to run for new term in 2024. fully in character: these people are servile beyond imagination – they thrive on bootlicking. however, the question remains, why now? putin’s next election is due in 2024. why proclaim him (potential) dictator for life so early into this term? share this: facebook reddit linkedin twitter like this: like loading... category politics, russia | tags: putin the meltdown 0 march 9, 2020 by ak saudi arabia has responded to russia’s refusal to cooperate by cutting prices and threatening (credibly, it seems) to raise output: the kingdom plans to pump more than 10m [million, not thousand] barrels a day next month while announcing unprecedented discounts of almost 20 per cent in key markets, in an apparent attempt to punish russia, while squeezing the us shale industry and other higher cost producers. production could eventually surpass 11m b/d, one of the people said, well above the roughly 9m riyadh had previously proposed lowering its output to. it appears that russia didn’t expect this response. perhaps it didn’t even believe that saudi arabia’s nominal spare capacity was real, especially after the houthi attacks last year. now much depends on the market’s appetite for saudi oil even at these seemingly giveaway prices. for domestic audiences, the kremlin is now busily explaining that it actually proposed prolonging the deal for another quarter (technically true) but the saudis and their allies went for an all-out price war (technically true but missing the key link). lying by omission doesn’t count in the rulebook of soviet and post-soviet propaganda. share this: facebook reddit linkedin twitter like this: like loading... category middle east, politics, russia | tags: oil, opec, saudi arabia disrupt and escalate 1 march 8, 2020 by ak it was a black friday for the oil market: opec and non-opec allies failed on friday to agree on how much oil production to cut amid the coronavirus outbreak, with russia reportedly refusing to give the green light to the deepest supply cuts since the global financial crisis. worse than that: not only did opec and key partner russia not agree to additional output curbs, but starting in april, current limits of 2.1 million barrels per day will no longer continue. more details from the ft: …moscow’s refusal to agree deeper cuts was a deal-breaker this week, demolishing a saudi plan to increase their size and prolong the curbs until the year-end… …moscow also eyed an opportunity to damage rival us shale producers and the wider american economy, said three people familiar with the discussions in vienna. “russia has had enough of the shale guys living off opec-plus,” said one person familiar with negotiations… this outcome was unexpected and shocked the oil market. why did russia take this course? i wouldn’t rule out something seriously untoward, such as plans to seize the baltics and/or ukraine/belarus, in which case the current state of the oil market wouldn’t be the kremlin’s primary concern. but in this insane scenario, wouldn’t it be logical (madmen can be highly logical within their framework of reference) to avoid any warning signs to the world? business as usual would make more sense than an advance bombshell. let’s hope this nightmare never materializes. perhaps russia merely wishes to stop the shale producers from free-riding on opec+ production cuts. it may expect us output growth to slow down or turn negative as a result, at least for a while. this is achievable although the potential cost to russia may exceed the kremlin’s estimates. moscow may even hope for a collapse in the shale segment and a steep decline in us oil and gas output, which isn’t going to happen any time soon, as the saudis have already found out for themselves. the kremlin may also be looking at this situation from the sanctions angle: “with flat production, we keep exporting more to china and less to the west. others are adding production capacity while the prices are high. one day, they will have enough capacity to replace our exports to europe and then the us would sanction us like they sanctioned iran and cut us off that market for good. to remain irreplaceable, we need to grow our market share.” at any rate, a risky, disruptive move to put it mildly. share this: facebook reddit linkedin twitter like this:
