"woolwich dockyard was an english naval dockyard founded by king henry viii in 1512 to build his flagship henri grace a dieu (great harry), the largest ship of its day. "like its counterpart at deptford, it was probably chosen for its position - on the south bank of the tidal river thames conveniently close to henry's palace at greenwich. "its facilities ultimately included two large dry docks, a substantial basin (now used by local anglers), numerous storehouses, a gatehouse and clockhouse, gun bastions, and, in later years, a large metal-working factory used to produce anchors and other iron items used in ship-building." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/woolwich_dockyard ✹ terry f. on 14 aug 2005 • link woolwich from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia "woolwich...is a town in south-east london, england in the london borough of greenwich, on the south side of the river thames, [...] "its history is strongly associated with britain's military past. it was home to the woolwich dockyard (founded in 1512), the royal arsenal (dating back to 1671), the royal military academy (1741) and the royal horse artillery (1793); it still retains an army base and the royal artillery museum.

"the resources needed to build a ship of the line were staggering; in addition to up to 2,000 mature trees, each ship required between 30 and 40 miles of rope, which needed renewing every 2 or 3 years. the woolwich ropeyard, eventually 1,080' long, produced standard 100 fathom (600 foot) lengths of rope. now largely lying under beresford street, it stretched from the arsenal gatehouse to riverside house." http://www.royal-arsenal.com/warship.html log in to post an annotation. if you don't have an account, then register here. references chart showing the number of references in each month of the diary’s entries. 1660 dec 9 10 11 17 1661 jan 11 14 15 feb 14 mar 7 may 21 jun 1 13 aug 15 1662 jan 27 feb 17 apr 4 11 jun 4 jul 11 13 21 24 28 30 31 aug 4 8 12 18 25 sep 5 19 oct 6 nov 24 dec 22 1663 jan 20 21 feb 20 mar 2 6 19 apr 1 8 14 may 4 5 11 18 20 22 26 jun 3 20 29 jul 7 20 21 23 30 aug 5 8 10 21 22 sep 9 26 nov 17 24 dec 4 18 24 1664 jan 22 feb 5 11 20 mar 4 24 apr 2 4 8 16 17 22 30 may 7 11 12 13 22 23 jun 1 17 27 30 jul 19 aug 3 26 sep 5 8 28 oct 25 26 28 nov 20 dec 27 1665 apr 5 30 may 5 29 jun 15 25 26 30 jul 5 8 9 12 17 18 26 28 aug 4 6 12 14 21 28 29 31 sep 1 3 6 7 10 11 13 14 15 17 22 26 28 30 oct 2 11 12 27 29 nov 11 19 26 29 30 dec 23 31 1666 jan 4 6 jun 3 5 7 16 jul 18 aug 2 17 sep 4 5 7 8 9 10 nov 2 1667 mar 4 22 apr 22 may 21 28 29 jun 10 13 14 23 jul 1 23 aug 27 1668 mar 24 jun 2 jul 8 1669 mar 16 may 14 maps see all places in this category on one map latest site news full samuel pepys club interview 27 march 2020 samuel pepys and the virus 25 march 2020 email, twitter & mastodon receive diary entries by email daily join the pepys’ diary email discussion group follow in real time on twitter or on mastodon rss feeds diary entries encyclopedia topics in-depth articles site news posts about this site is run by phil gyford @philgyford on twitter more about this site
