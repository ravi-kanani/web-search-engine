be attentive!” the priest chanted as he processed in holding the new testament above his head. my godfather used to joke the priest was really saying, “shut up! you might learn something important!” then the priest sang the story of a father who’s little girl was dying and beseeched jesus to come to his house and heal her. but, as jesus made his way to the man’s home, he was crushed by the crowds who wanted a piece of him. a woman, who’d been suffering from bleeding for years, jostled her way through the crowd and touched jesus’ cloak. “who touched me?” he asked the crowd. but no one fessed up. “someone touched me,” jesus said. “i know that power has gone out from me.” then the woman who touched his cloak, realizing she’d be found out, fell trembling to her knees and told him that she was the one who touched him and, in a moment, had been miraculously healed. “daughter,” jesus said. “your faith has healed you. go in peace,” but then a neighbor came and told the father of the sick little girl that it was too late. she was dead. hearing this, jesus said to father, “don’t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.” and you know the rest of the story. jesus went to the man’s house raised that little girl from the dead. reading finished, the priest began his sermon, a beautifully simple reflection about interruptions. he talked about how, in our daily lives, we get stressed out when people or events block us from doing what we want to do. when people make demands on our seemingly precious time – when they bother us with their problems. “we want to do everything on our schedule,” he said. “we hate being interrupted. look at how none of us answers the phone any more, letting it go to voicemail so we can decide whether to answer them or not. look at how we get upset if someone cuts us off in traffic or interrupts our leisure time. it stresses us out! even when we do charitable work, we want it to be on our time, when we feel like doing it. but life just doesn’t work that way,.” thinking about all my holiday tasks, i shook my head ruefully. “can you imagine what was going through the father of that dying girl’s mind?” the priest said. “her time was running out and the crowds were preventing jesus from getting to her. how crazy that must have made him!” as a father of a little girl myself, i know i’d have gone nuts. “jesus however,” the priest continued, “was always being interrupted. but he didn’t see interruptions as a bother. he saw them as an opportunity. that’s why he stopped and talked to the woman who touched him. he didn’t brush her off or chastise her. he took the time to make a connection with her and still found time to raise that father’s child from the dead. that’s because the lord knew there’s always time for what is important. we must follow the lord’s example and see interruptions not as a burden, but as an opportunity to learn something new. he call us to connect to people where they’re at in the here and now – to take life as it comes, not as we want it to be. if we do so, we’ll hear the wisdom life is always trying to teach us.” looking at the little girl in my office, that priest’s words rang in my ears. taking a deep breath, i reminded myself this family was only asking me to do what i’m getting paid for. as we talked, i learned this this family had fled to america from a very difficult part of the world. they had left behind their culture, language, family and friends to give their children a better life in the new world. i imagined my wife and i sitting in those client chairs as my five year old daughter stared wide eyed at a stranger asking questions. i wondered how i’d handle uprooting my life in such a drastic way – having to ask for help to feed and clothe my child and get her christmas presents. it isn’t easy, especially for men, to ask for such help. i thought about my comparative life of ease. i thought about my house, my full fridge and all the toys in my daughter’s room. that’s when i realized that supplicant dad was a better father than me. application finished, i showed the family around the food pantry and they shopped, filling a cart with food. when they were done, i grabbed a basket of stuffed animals i keep around for these situations and told the children to pick one. they were tentative at first but, under their mother’s gentle prodding, they started picking through the basket. the little girl took the smallest toy we had. ‘you can have that if you want,” i said. “but i think this teddy bear has your name on it.” as the girl and boy hugged their new toys happily, i knew this was the best thing i’d accomplished all week. like the woman who touched jesus’ cloak, it’s entirely possible these children would remember this small moment for the rest of their lives. that, after the ugliness of their former homeland, getting those toys might, consciously or unconsciously, instill in them a sense that people could still be kind, that the world was still a good place. and if i had shooed this family away because i was anxious about getting my paperwork done, that opportunity would’ve been lost after the family left, i played my favorite recording of the divine liturgy of st, john chrysostom on my computer and listened as its haunting and beautiful words filled my office, when the priest sang, “that we may be delivered from all affliction, wrath and need,” i remembered that, in a very small way, my job is to be the deliverer of such providence. swept up in my own selfishness, ego and desire to control things, i forget that sometimes. how many of those “interruptions” that’ve driven me crazy over the years were actually opportunities for connection that i’d squandered? how many times – not only in my job – but in my marriage, family, friendships, and human interactions great and small did i fail people? we think our time is precious, even to the point of equating it with money. but thinking of time in terms of profit and loss only lead to frustration, making us parsimonious with our attentions and hardening our hearts to those opportunities for wisdom always swirling around us. ignoring people to save time doesn’t make us rich, only poorer. so, the lesson of jesus and that dying man’s child might be this – try not to get frustrated with interruptions because time does not belong to you. it is not a commodity we can control or hoard. as a wise man once said, “time is the moving image of eternity.” we’re just along for the ride. so shut up and listen to people. you might learn something. besides, you’ll eventually get to where you’re going anyway. you have all the time in the world. 7 comments syed moin doja on november 7, 2019 at 11:34 pm darn it !
