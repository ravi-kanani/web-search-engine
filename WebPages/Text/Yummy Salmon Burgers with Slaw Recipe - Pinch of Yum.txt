the crispy-salty-tangy combo is an on point combo. plus, again with the super nutrition. plus sugar free january friendly. let’s talk herbs for salmon burgers dill isn’t really in season at the moment, but i do love to have these salmon burgers with a little dill. you can usually buy it at the grocery store in those little plastic clamshells that cost too much. know the ones i’m talking about? but if you’re not super excited about the expensive-winter-dill-in-a-clamshell situation, you can use 1) freeze-dried dill, which i keep in my spice collection year-round, and 2) any other fresh herb! i made a version of these with parsley and cilantro when i didn’t have any dill, and mwah. they were still totally delicious. dill would still be my first choice, but as with all my favorite recipes, you can play with that a little bit. yes, we’re using canned salmon and now for the big question. do you use canned salmon? subtext: is it gross? answer: yes, i use canned salmon, and no, it most certainly is not gross in these salmon burgers if you are buying the right stuff. fresh salmon that you’ve already cooked would also work if canned salmon is too weird for you. but i’d like to take a moment to assure you that it is very possible to find non-gross canned salmon if you do a little searching and are willing to spend a little extra for higher quality. i really like wild planet canned salmon. it is caught in alaska, and wild planet prioritizes sustainability and conservation of marine ecosystems with all their products. not sponsored, just a superfan. you can also buy it here on amazon (affiliate link). and because it’s canned, you can just keep it in your pantry and have it at the ready whenever you need a little salmon burger happiness. god bless pantry meals. check out our video for how to make salmon burgers: salmon burgers with slaw ★★★★★ 4.9 from 59 reviews author: lindsay prep time: 5 minutes cook time: 10 minutes total time: 15 minutes yield: 3–4 burgers 1x print recipe pin recipe description these salmon burgers are the yummiest! and made with just five ingredients. the best for a quick + easy high protein lunch or dinner. scale 1x2x3x ingredients salmon burgers 12–14 ounces cooked salmon 2 eggs 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs, like chives, parsley, or dill a squeeze of lemon juice olive oil for pan-frying cabbage slaw: 1 head green cabbage, finely shredded 1 cup plain greek yogurt 2–3 tablespoons white distilled vinegar (more to taste) 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 cup chopped fresh herbs like chives, parsley, or cilantro a drizzle of olive oil instructions for the salmon burgers: flake the salmon apart. mix all burger ingredients together and form into 3 large or 4 medium patties. heat olive oil over medium heat, ideally in a nonstick skillet. fry the burgers for a few minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy. place on a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle with salt. for the slaw: mix all slaw ingredients together. taste and adjust. serve: serve up those hot salmon burgers on a bed of creamy slaw. i top mine with a dollop of extra yogurt and a swizzle of oil and more herbs. can’t stop me. notes breadcrumbs are important here. panko gives a really nice texture whereas whole wheat breadcrumbs would be a good choice if you want to skip the refined grains. if you use a seasoned breadcrumb mix, reduce the amount of salt in the burgers by about 1/2. for the salmon, you could use leftover steamed, poached, grilled, baked, whatever kinda salmon. if you don’t have any cooked salmon handy, use canned salmon! that’s what i usually do. i would recommend looking for a brand of canned salmon that is caught in the us. i really, really like wild planet for quality canned salmon. you can read more about their sourcing/fishing methods here. if you happen to have a jar of sunshine sauce in your fridge, use that to make the slaw! just mix cabbage with yogurt, add some sunshine sauce, and polish it off with a little dill. super yummy. the burgers will keep pretty well in the fridge (~3 days) or freezer (~3 months). when you’re ready to eat, pop them in a nonstick skillet to reheat because it will retain crispiness! the slaw, however, is best eaten right away. it probably has one day max in the fridge once it’s been mixed up. gluten free: we tried three different gf options – almond flour, crushed chex cereal, and gf oats. all three turned out to be great substitutes, but we liked the smooth texture and flavor of the almond flour version the best. almond meal would work just as well too. category: dinner method: fry cuisine: american keywords: salmon burgers, seafood burger, dill recipe, seafood recipe, canned salmon did you make this recipe?

or maybe i’ll just buy fresh 😉. amyway, thanks for the recipe! 01/03/18 @ 10:19 am reply dixya @food, pleasure, and health yesss pantry friendly meals are the best and im totally digging this combo! 01/03/18 @ 10:37 am reply tina these look amazing! i really love your photography. i use canned salmon a lot and love it:) i don’t think it’s gross at all. i always have canned fish in my cupboard for back pocket recipes. it’s a healthy hack. ★★★★★ 01/03/18 @ 10:45 am reply alix @a hedgehog in the kitchen i am such a fan of salmon burgers… and dill… so am loving this recipe! thanks lindsay! ★★★★★ 01/03/18 @ 11:10 am reply sarah thank you so much for trying out a gf option for us. i think my tastebuds and yours are related. i love pretty much every recipe you have come up with and it’s always a joy when i don’t have to mess around with them to make them gf. 01/03/18 @ 11:45 am reply sue carlson so excited about the salmon burger recipe with slaw. no need for canned salmon from the store when you live in alaska and have a fabulous son in law who keeps you supplied with salmon! yippee! 01/03/18 @ 11:45 am reply j thank you for the recommendation on a type of canned salmon that isn’t awful. the grayish, slimy, nasty situation going on in most canned salmon is totally revolting to me. i’ve never actually been to whole foods (gasp!), but i would venture there just for canned salmon that was delicious. 01/03/18 @ 11:45 am reply april this looks delish and quick and easy! i’ve been reluctant to try canned fish other than tuna but you’ve convinced me to give it a try. it does make sense to have it in the pantry. 01/03/18 @ 11:52 am reply analida @ethnicspoon we love salmon burgers at our house, so i don’t think they are weird. 🙂 i have never served them with slaw, but i think it i s a great idea. great recipe! ★★★★★ 01/03/18 @ 12:14 pm reply debbie spivey oh yum! i’m putting this one on my to-do list. my mama used to make tuna cakes when i was little. i love salmon, so i know these are good. 🙂 01/03/18 @ 12:14 pm reply sara one of my & my husband’s go to meals is similar to this – a salmon patty recipe (that includes some finely diced green bell pepper for extra crunch & nutrients) + braised red cabbage (only 5 ingredients: cabbage, butter, onion powder, apple cider vinegar, water). we get our canned salmon at costco. so good! 01/03/18 @ 12:15 pm reply joy are these based off of the food network salmon burgers that you posted about on instagram awhile back? (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/salmon-burgers-with-green-apple-slaw-3894917). i saved that recipe because it looked good to me — i like that you cut the green apple (didn’t seem appealing to me, either). would add a little tiny sugar or honey to the slaw to round it out. 01/03/18 @ 1:46 pm reply patricia @freshfoodinaflash these sound really great. thanks for the inspiration. 01/03/18 @ 1:58 pm reply jessica gibson i have one recipe that i grew up with that uses canned salmon. it’s essentially a salmon loaf, but my kids gobble it up. we will definitely try this, because i’d love to learn more things to make with canned salmon. and yes, it is gross picking out some of the bones, but so cheap, so healthy, so easy! 01/03/18 @ 2:14 pm reply cammi s. could these be baked in the oven instead of pan-fried? 01/03/18 @ 2:31 pm reply jenna @ pinch of yum i don’t see why not! 🙂 01/04/18 @ 10:35 am reply rebecca lately these actually sound really good. i love using slaw on burgers! 01/03/18 @ 2:50 pm reply stacey this looks amazing! i am definitely gonna try this on the family. 😀 01/03/18 @ 3:36 pm reply sabrina like a big crab cake, i like it and even without a bun (preferred anyway) thank you for this recipe and like the cabbage slaw too! 01/03/18 @ 4:49 pm reply blogtastic food omg i need this right now! might try this (: 01/03/18 @ 5:54 pm reply olivia yum ! will definitely give it a try this week ! any dairy-free alternative for greek yogourt ? 01/03/18 @ 6:00 pm reply jenna @ pinch of yum we don’t have any idea that come to mind – but you could maybe possible omit so the dressing is more like a vinaigrette? 01/04/18 @ 10:36 am reply carol borchardt coconut yogurt? you could also try soy sour cream if you’re not opposed to soy. 01/04/18 @ 8:03 pm reply anna thanks for the recipe inspiration! finally got around to trying this- turned out great! fyi- i subbed instant mashed potato flakes for the bread crumbs and it worked well 💜 also added a bit of sugar to the slaw (personal pref.), and made a sauce to top out of greek yogurt, a little mayo, smoked paprika, garlic powder, frank’s hot sauce, and lemon juice. ★★★★★ 02/12/20 @ 8:04 pm reply eman @ pinch of yum glad you enjoyed this, anna! 02/13/20 @ 9:20 am reply alexandra for those who hate canned tuna, canned salmon is way better … especially cooked, i am soooo excited to try this recipe. second the idea to make more “basic pantry” posts. i love everything ive tried from you … thank you! 01/03/18 @ 8:40 pm reply stephanie this looks so good! i adore salmon. i’ll have to look for fresh, though, because we don’t have a whole foods by us and i really don’t need 12 cans of salmon delivered to my house. 😉 sadly, i’m the only one in the house who will eat salmon, but i’ll just have to save this recipe for boys’ night out! thanks for sharing! 01/03/18 @ 9:00 pm reply christina do you have a fred meyer? i just looked at their app and they say they have the brand she mentioned. 🙂 11/29/18 @ 9:19 pm reply kentuckylady717 this is my kind of food, i love salmon any way you fix it….can’t wait to fix both recipes…i always use mayonnaise in my cole slaw, but will try it this way for a change….. giving it a 5* because i know it will be 🙂 just found your website i think, i belong to so many blogs, can’t keep up with them all…..so what was for dessert ? i just made banana nut bread today…..pretty yummy, and the heat from the oven sure felt good…..:) ★★★★★ 01/03/18 @ 11:44 pm reply [email protected] love salmon burgers! they’re just to simple to make. i particularly like the slaw you’ve got to go with yours lindsay. ★★★★★ 01/04/18 @ 7:14 am reply newer comments » hey! nice to meet you! i'm lindsay: former 4th grade teacher, now full time blogger. my husband bjork and i live in minnesota. favorite things include my camera, lake days, and dark chocolate. learn more. popular posts dinner baked mozzarella chicken rolls quick and easy miracle no knead bread vegetarian instant pot wild rice soup quick and easy date night mushroom fettuccine blogging tips delivered straight to your inbox blogger resources top posts 1 avoiding blog burnout2 blogging as a couple3 building a blog while traveling4 how to start a food blog5 creating an income6 tools bloggers shouldn't live without7 photography tips start, grow, and monetize your food blog. join today. how’s this for awesome?
