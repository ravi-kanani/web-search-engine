    if (function_exists('zeno_font_resizer_place')) {
        zeno_font_resizer_place();
    }
?>
 how can i use the template code and do stuff with it? you can use the parameter ‘$echo = false’ and the function will return the html-string: <?php
    if (function_exists('zeno_font_resizer_place')) {
        $font_resizer = zeno_font_resizer_place( false );
        // do stuff with $font_resizer...
    }
?>
 how can i change the color of the a’s? with css in your theme. use something like: p.zeno_font_resizer > a {
    color: blue;
}
 on the widget i see text meant for screen-readers. your theme is missing some necessary css for ‘.screen-reader-text’. please contact the maker of your theme. more information can be found in the handbook about accessibility. i want to use a shortcode in my content element there is an additional plugin on github you can use for that. reviews great plugin, better if “em” is available anthonychan2509 march 12, 2020 it's the best font resize plugin available. easy to use, customize and flexible. it would be even better if we can choose the unit between "px" and "em". thanks a lot. excellent plugin! kenttubman november 15, 2019 installation was easy and worked as expected. nice, flexible settings to suit most themes or applications. forum support was great and very helpful. this plugin helps with wcag 2.0 level aa compliance. thanks! awesome gsina august 8, 2019 thanks much resize character albrechtino november 7, 2018 i cannot chance the size of the "resize character" lovely stucorner august 5, 2018 easy to use and simple to set up. it functionally works flawlessly for my purpose, but could do with a few more features to make it easier for customisation by those with little knowledge. decent support. my one issue was resolved in a few days. updated for screenreaders mydesigner july 6, 2018 thanks for adding the alt tag so screenreaders know what it is for. extremely useful esp for accessibility websites! easy to use and works well. read all 15 reviews contributors & developers “zeno font resizer” is open source software. the following people have contributed to this plugin.contributors marcel pol “zeno font resizer” has been translated into 3 locales. thank you to the translators for their contributions. translate “zeno font resizer” into your language. interested in development?
