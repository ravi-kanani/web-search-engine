petite anglaise about petite anglaise my name is catherine sanderson. and to the left is an uncharacteristically flattering photo taken by a professional photographer. i dreamed about living in paris from the moment my very first french lesson began at the age of eleven. i’m the wrong side of forty now, and paris has been my home since 1995. i set up this blog in july 2004. my first book, a memoir based on events covered in the blog, was published in several languages in 2008. my second book, a novel – ‘french kissing’ – was published in the uk in august 2009. petite anglaise came into existence on a whim one day, after reading the guardian’s guide to weblogs and becoming engrossed in the adventures of belle de jour. a matter of minutes later, i created a site of my own using blogger. i came across the union jack eye image i used as my avatar quite by accident, but it summed up my perspective nicely: a brit’s-eye view of life in paris. anglaise means, quite simply, english female, and petite means little. french people tend to refer to all english females, regardless of age or size, as petites anglaises so it seemed like the obvious choice for my nom de souris. petite anglaise started out mainly as light hearted commentaries on aspects of life in france with some anecdotes about the trials and tribulations of raising a bilingual toddler thrown in. it evolved over time, becoming more personal, touching on adoption, the breakdown of my relationship with tadpole’s father after “meeting” a man in my comments box, and our subsequent separation. in april 2006, i got the sack from my secretarial job when my employer was alerted to the existence of this site and objected to the scant references i’d made to my workplace. i went offline for a month and had a bit of a meltdown, but also consulted with lawyers and resolved to take my ex-employer to a tribunal for unfair dismissal. i decided to give a single interview about what had happened to a fellow paris blogger, colin randall, who happened to be the paris bureau chief for the daily telegraph (it’s amazing the contacts you end up making through a lowly blog…) my life became surreal for a couple of months after that. my story went global, including a stint on the front page of cnn.com which caused my blog to crash for a while, and i found myself being interviewed for television and radio. i had to say goodbye (albeit reluctantly) to my anonymity at this point, although i managed to protect the identity of my daughter and her father. once the dust settled, several publishers manifested interest in my blog and my story, a bidding war ensued, and i was able to concentrate on writing full-time for three years, after signing a two book deal with penguin in the uk. it didn’t really pan out, to be honest, in the sense that i’d have had to sell an awful lot of books for the publisher to recoup their investment. i think at the time, a lot of publishers thought popular blogs would translate to big book sales, and it rarely proved to be the case… but i didn’t do too badly for myself, all things considered, and i’m proud of what i achieved. i’ve received a ton of emails over the years from readers who enjoyed both petite and french kissing, from iceland to lithuania, and i’m thankful for every single one (and almost always reply!) i decided to stop updating this blog shortly after the birth of my second child, in november 2009. i went back to working as a bilingual pa in 2011. there were some interesting clauses in my contract, to prevent me ever writing about my work in the future! currently i don’t have the time or inclination to write, but i think one day that will change, so watch this space… you can find more – extremely random – info about me on my 37 things page or on my q&a page. you can email me here. photo © laurent attias share this: twitter facebook search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com. post to cancel
