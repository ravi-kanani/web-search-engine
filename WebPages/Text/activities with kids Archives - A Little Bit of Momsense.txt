[tweet “get your tickets for the story of babar at @shenkmanarts on april 7 – and register your child for one of the special hands-on workshops too! via @bitofmomsense” #ottawa] this show is recommended for children around age 3-7. there will be music and laughter and storytelling to ignite your child’s imagination. i also love that for an extra $5, you can stay for a post-show meet and greet with the actors and interact with what was on stage. there are two special 30-minute workshops; one focusing on music, the other on stage. please note, parent supervision is required for both, and workshop registration needs to be made in advance of the show by calling 613-580-2700 or by visiting our box office in person. tickets for the workshops are limited. here’s the description for each of the workshops – they sounds hands-on and fun! babar in music create a new babar adventure and your own musical arrangement for the story! drawing on composer francis poulenc’s music for the story of babar, the children will identify the funny sounds to be included in their new arrangement. they will select instruments to create sound effects and compose their own new storytelling arrangement. babar on stage challenge your imagination! as part of this workshop, the children will craft their own puppet versions of babar, celeste and arthur or any other elephant character based on the story of babar concert. they will then have the chance to improvise actions and situations with their characters in a series of theatrical games. want to create your own memories with your kids about babar? tickets are available for the two upcoming shows on april 7, and for the special workshops. click the following links for your preferred show time, and to learn more about the musical presentation!

i couldn’t help but laugh, and told her that i don’t see it ending anytime soon. if you are thinking about taking kids to tea at chateau laurier, i highly recommend it. they have a tea menu just for the kids (which includes the choice of hot chocolate or tea) and we have always felt welcomed there for this special experience. rebecca 4 min read march 29, 2017 1 reply winter fun, sweet maple delights and more at parc omega around ottawa the last time we went to parc omega we had a blast. you can read about our adventures and tips here. it was so much fun not only getting to feed carrots to the animals in an up close and personal way, but to learn about the different habitats, species and diverse area that parc omega hosts. it was wonderful to see the passion and care that they put into everything they do and the animals who live there. when they invited us back to check out their maple sugar shack, it was an easy decision for all of us to return. not only did we realize that this was a great way to spend some time outdoors as the snow was still on the ground (and we were sulking about it), but also, i am always ready for some maple taffy. this time of year is when the maple sap is flowing and maple syrup producers are busy. the sugar shack at parc omega is unique in that it’s a smaller production and uses old-school techniques. sap is collected by hand with buckets on the trees, and boiled in a wooden shack. it reminded me of when my grandfather would collect sap and boil it outside in a giant pot. that syrup always had a bit more smokiness to the flavour, it was often darker and delicious in a different way than what we can get at the store. the syrup at parc omega was like my childhood. we were treated to maple taffy (a huge hit with my family, always) and we tucked into the tabled cabin with a wood burning fire place to warm up while we ate. the sugar shack area is a central hub for the walking, cross country skiing and snowshoeing trails making it the perfect mini stop if you are out and about. naturally, while the maple syrup area was a highlight for me, getting to see the animals was a huge attraction for the kids. i can’t tell you how many times each of them told us they were having a great time. we saw a black bear who was recently out of hibernation, and learned about the elks and deer losing their antlers and growing them back at this time of year. we saw baby boars (which were adorable!) and learned about the timber wolves during a feeding presentation. we also got a peek at their new lumber camp which has tables for eating, a place to warm up and a food counter. this is an area that is expanding in the upcoming months and by summertime it sounds like it’s going to be another exciting area to check out, grab a bite and relax in between all of the excitement. stop by the lumber camp if you want to rent snow shoes and head to the sugar shack! the sugar shack will be open until april 2, unless the snow sticks around, then they may extend the opening. even as the weather warms up, you’ll find plenty to do at parc omega. visit the animals, grab a bite to eat (there is a new menu that currently includes a lot of tasty bites!) and attend educational demonstrations and shows to learn more about the animals around. don’t forget! bring plenty of carrots or grab some bags at the main lodge of parc omega! the animals (and your kids) will thank you! visit #parcomega to enjoy the sugar shack (and of course the animals!) via @bitofmomsense #outaouaisfun click to tweet disclosure: parc omega invited us to attend and gave us tickets and lunch. all opinions are my own. thank you parc omega for the fun visit!

with performances at 3:30 and 6:30 pm on thursday night, your entire family can delight at this performance. max and ruby were often on tv when my kids were younger and as parents i think we all have had a laugh at their antics with a bit of tongue firmly planted in cheek at times (where were their parents?!) but the duo continue to be childhood favourites and a holiday performance on stage could be the start of a new tradition for your family! i love taking the kids to live shows, and this time of year it’s nice to get out and spend that time together, especially since we are all so busy. i love the nutcracker music, and the dancing of course will be lovely. tied to the characters of max and ruby, this is such a sweet way to introduce your children to a classic holiday performance that is kid-friendly for them. show up early to the performance to participate in the nepean visual arts centre craft activity as well. grab your tickets soon before they are sold out!. check out the trailer below for a sneak peek!

print out as many as you need! print pages – pdf comic book pages printable (the image below is not full size) rebecca 0 min read october 6, 2012 no reply activity: making thanksgiving napkin rings (easy!) activities and crafts, kids yesterday was a pd day and with thanksgiving tomorrow (that we are hosting) it was a perfect opportunity to do a craft with the kids. using materials we already had around the house, both kids made these easy napkin rings. they are adorable and will look lovely at everyone’s place setting for our thanksgiving feast. **tip! this is perfect to keep the kids busy while you are preparing the dinner! all you need: -paper towel holder, cut into 1 inch pieces -any colour of construction paper but into strips, just over 1 inch in width -glue stick -fall/thanksgiving stickers have the kids put glue on the construction paper, the entire length. roll the paper over the paper towel holder piece. add stickers voila!

what was most impressive was that they built the boats themselves (with assistance of course) but seeing them work with the hammer, figuring out where the pieces go and then the pride on their faces when they were done was priceless. thank goodness for a very fun cousin 😉 rebecca 2 min read february 6, 2012 11 replies 3 of our favourite boardgames to play with preschoolers parenting when my children reached the age where they could finally start to play board games, it was a wonderful new activity that we could do together. but some games are simply too complicated for the toddler/preschool set. fortunately, we have 3 family favourites that my toddler can play but also my school-aged son is still interested in playing (this is essential for those afternoons when i am trying to make everyone happy!) what are these three board games that have been well played, well loved and don’t drive mama crazy? 1) memory it’s a classic. this toopy and binoo version is well used and fun. but the game can be played with a deck of cards or a fun activity is to make your own cards with your favourite characters, upper/lower case letters and so on! 2) hungry hungry hippos another classic that we all played as kids i’m sure. now the ‘marbles’ are plastic, but the game play remains the same. simple for little hands to get used to, and exciting enough for our mini competitors to get into the spirit of wanting to chomp chomp chomp! extend the game (and learning opportunity) by taking turns counting how many balls everyone got. 3) cariboo island this is a branch of the popular cranium game, but geared to the younger set. there are two sets of cards, one for younger children, the other for older, which makes this game great for growing with the kids. select a card, then with the key open a box that fits the requirement (by colour, shape, letter etc) and search for coins. collect 6 coins to open the treasure chest! eta: honourable mention: candyland. how did candyland become the game parents have grown to not love but the kids do? especially those of us with special versions like dora? this gets an honourable mention because we don’t own this game, but grandma does, and it’s well loved and used each time we visit 😉 a really fun game for all of us. what are some of your favourite board games for younger children? do you like playing board games? honestly, i can’t wait for the kids to get old enough for games like scrabble, monopoly and trivial pursuit! rebecca 1 min read december 21, 2011 no reply activity: easy science – making colours parenting my son is really into science lately – at age 5 he’s not trying to take apart dna samples, but he’s really interested in doing easy and fun hands-on experiments and anything that requires eye droppers etc. is a plus. one day i set up different bowls with coloured water and gave him a dropper and empty bowl to mix the colours and see what they make when combined. he loved it so much! i gave him a card to record his experiment results on and had him guess what colours he thought would be created when combining 2 of the primary colours. it was fun and interactive and i can see that i’ll be doing more of these activities in the future! 1- using water and food colouring, set up small bowls with red, blue and yellow colours. 2-give your child an empty bowl and an eye dropper (i often save the droppers from medicine bottles). 3-use a cue card or paper to draw empty squares for your child to colour in as s/he goes along. 4-talk about the experiment. what colour do you think blue and red make? is the hypothesis correct? have fun!
