and possibly my favourite activity – families can decorate a gingerbread house together! all of the crafts are meant to be family projects, so adults will need to help little hands complete the activities. but that’s part of the fun, right? make new christmas memories at the nepean museum on december 15th. it sounds like the entire day will be filled with festive fun, and takeaways the kids will love too. for more information, visit the facebook page, or the website. photo credit: city of ottawa museums rebecca 4 min read november 25, 2018 no reply our 2018 advent activity calendar activities and crafts it’s almost december 1, which means it’s almost time for our annual activity advent calendar to count down until christmas. we have been doing an activity advent since 2009 (when i read about it from a fellow blogger) and since then, it’s become a beloved tradition. every year we update the list a little bit based on our own family’s plans, and as the kids grow. there are some that stick around every year because we love them, and others are there because to be honest, they are easy. as with other years, here are some tips i’m sharing about creating your own activity calendar: a) don’t put dates on the activities. you may need to switch them up once and a while if something changes, illness hits etc. b) stock up on the stuff you need for each activities like hot chocolate or craft supplies. c) check your family calendar and add in activities to the 25 days countdown list that you already know you’ll be doing – like santa letters or a family visit. this list is also created in close consultation with my calendar based on days of the week– some activities can’t be done easily on a weekday so i made sure they were on the weekend. i also know the weekend we are planning to get the christmas tree, so i can add that in accordingly, etc. what’s most important about this calendar isn’t that you put too much effort into crafting the perfect activity, it’s that as a family you come together and take a few moments each day to celebrate and spend time doing something together that is festive, fun and family oriented. that’s probably why i love it so much. daily activities to do with your kids as you countdown to christmas via @bitofmomsense #25daysofchristmas #adventcalendar click to tweet one final note: what’s up with the singing? you’ll notice my list has a few spots where the activity for the day is to simply sing a christmas song. my son has requested these be removed but nope – they stay. why? because honestly, some days are busy, or tiring, or i’m just overwhelmed so having a few ‘freebie’ days means that we still get to do an activity, but it’s extremely simple. it works! as much as i love the holidays, i’m also a big fan of slowing things down, so when it gets to be too much, give yourself permission to skip a day (or just sing a song!) here are our activities for 2018. please feel free to take any for your own list that you think you and the kids will love! 1. write and mail letters to santa. 2. watch our kick-off holiday movie ‘the muppet christmas carol” 3. make clay ornaments 4. set up a special hot chocolate bar 5. make paper snowflakes 6. sing jingle bells 7. go to the cumberland heritage museum village of lights 8. get the christmas tree! 9.go to chateau montebello 10. decorate the christmas tree! 11. buy and bring toys to toy mountain 12. dessert for supper, supper for dessert! 13. write a special christmas greeting to your sibling and mail it to them (it will be a nice read when they receive it!) 14. make a list of ten things we are thankful for. hang it where you can see it every day. 15. make holiday wreaths 16. decorate christmas cookies! 17. deliver christmas cookies to friends and family 18. deliver food to the local food bank collection. 19. sing we wish you a merry christmas! 20. go for a drive to see christmas lights at taffy lane. 21. bring in snow and make maple taffy! 22. go to wesley clover parks magic of lights 23. make a ginger bread house! 24. unwrap one present (mommy and daddy get to pick which one) 25. it’s christmas day. remember you have a family who loves you. and that’s the most important gift of all. pin it for later or next year! rebecca 1 min read february 23, 2012 2 replies activity: counting to 100 using pennies and craft paper activities and crafts as part of 100 days of school and kindness week, my son’s class was asked to count out 100 pennies to bring for donation to a local foundation. i love this idea. not only is it a great way to be kind, but it was a chance for us to talk about numbers and counting. first, i set out craft paper on the dining table. the kids started by drawing on it and having fun with it. then, i drew 10 circles and marked x10 in each. my son was tasked with counting out 10 pennies at a time and putting them in a circle. once he completed all the circles, we talked about counting by 10s, how many pennies there were in total and so on. he seemed to really enjoy it! add on: while he was doing that, my daughter was counting (trying) nickels into 5 circles marked x4 in each. when everyone’s money was sorted, we talked about which pile (the 10×10 pennies or the 5×4 nickels) had more value. my son picked the pennies (there are more pennies afterall!) but then we talked about how many pennies are in a nickel etc. it was a great activity! when it was all done, he had a bag of pennies for donation. rebecca 0 min read october 21, 2011 2 replies preschool activity: creepy crawly spiders! parenting easy to make, but fun to do – check out these creepy and crawly halloween spiders!

(my son was quick to point out that i didn’t have a selection of french books so i had to fix that. mr. french immersion now) 3) the kids select their books and i acted as librarian. each time they took out a book, i stamped their library card. they would sit quietly, read, and return the book for a new one. 4) eventually, they wanted a turn being the librarian so they could stamp too. have fun! rebecca 1 min read september 5, 2011 1 reply preschool at home: little sis wants to go to school too activities and crafts on wednesday i kiss my big nearly 5 year old boy goodbye and send him back to school. it’s only 2.5 hours a day, and he’s looking forward to it so it’s a very different feeling i have about it than i had last year. meanwhile, his little sister is still at home. she’ll be three in february and the idea of sending her to preschool this year did cross our minds. but then she would be in preschool for two years before even starting regular school. we thought it was a bit much (and selfishly, we wanted to keep her at home a while longer!). but as i did with her brother, we will be doing some fun preschool activities at home. learning numbers and the alphabet, crafts, seasons, and reading. doing these short burst of ‘circle time’ activities was something her brother really enjoyed – and helped me fill the day. i know she will enjoy it just as much. i’ll be blogging some of the fun stuff we come up with, but in the meantime, i’ve added a new page (see top header bar) to keep the activities in one place for easy reference. not sure what to do today? maybe you can find something you want to make! preschool activity page enjoy rebecca 1 min read june 25, 2011 3 replies preschool activity: emotions activities and crafts, kids, parenting toddlers and preschoolers are extremely emotional but often don’t really understand their emotions. we try to talk about feelings – happy, sad, angry – as best we can to prevent or recover from tantrums, frustrations and things that make us smile. this activity encourages this discussion further and involves your child. first, lay out a long piece of paper larger than the length of your child. (i have the melissa and doug paper roll that i use) have your child lie down and trace him or her. cut out the trace (if your child is old enough they can help cut) have your child colour some clothes, add a face etc. if you don’t have paper large enough, you can skip that part and just print out the emotion faces below and continue talking. cut out circles on separate pieces of paper. draw different emotional faces on them: angry, sad, happy, surprised etc. or print out these handy emotion cards: emotions (happy/sad) emotions (angry/surprised) talk to your child about situations that may cause an emotion and ask them which one the cut out would feel or put an emotional face on the cut out and ask what emotion that is and why they may feel that way. example: “when was a time that you felt very happy?” “if your sister takes your toys, how does that make you feel?” “how do you feel christmas morning?” have fun and encourage your child to talk about their emotions. facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube grab a coffee and join me! welcome to a little bit of momsense! my name is rebecca and i'm chatting about parenting, family friendly activities, yummy recipes, family travel, and living a life full of love and laughter. thanks for stopping by! fabulous advertisers, friends and affiliates for content tips and support – subscribe! use code momsense10 to save 20% this error message is only visible to wordpress admins error: the account for needs to be reconnected. due to recent instagram platform changes this instagram account needs to be reconnected in order to continue updating. reconnect on plugin settings page visit rebecca's profile on pinterest. tags activities activities with kids activity around ottawa baseball birthdays blogging centrepointe theatres children christmas disney junior family family activities family time family travel food gift guide giveaway halloween holidays home kids kraft canada learning march break mothers day netflix ottawa ottawa events parenting pei pinterest play preschool activity recipe recipes school shopping sobeys summer tag along toys terra20 thanksgiving theatre travel archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 missed a post? making a greener difference with these easy changes (plus enter to win!) activity: make and design a hotel! activities for kids: subjective art a fun scavenger hunt game for the kids (with printable!) playing with cardboard – don’t recycle those boxes yet! get-moving activity: movement stations for kids 8 carry-on items to travel with: what i bring to travel family travel: hotel tips for travelling with children walt disney world planning tips: family travel ottawa giveaway: enter to win 4 tickets at meridian theatres facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube we use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website for personalization, advertising and to analyze usage. by using this site, you agree to this.continuewant more info? read our privacy policy.
