hopefully theyâ€™ll find it funny and will share them with their friends. and because iâ€™ll feel secretly guilty all day long, iâ€™ll have real brownies as an after school snack. no fooling! you can download our sheet of â€˜browniesâ€™ by throwing your email in the box below: 2. basketball hoop plug every single day, owen and our neighbors are outside shooting hoops. so i thought iâ€™d put a little wrench in their game today. weâ€™ll see how it goes. . . all i did was lower the hoop, stand on a chair, and use packing tape to secure plastic wrap to the rim. then i raised the hoop back to 10 feet. bam. swoosh! or not. . . 3. banded hairbrushes maddy and cora always stand the same way when theyâ€™re brushing their hair: they stare at themselves in the mirror, grab their brush without looking, and tear through their knotty hair. so this little trick will stop them in their tracks a little. maybe. i added rubber bands to their brushes. in and around the bristles of their brush. thatâ€™s it. heeheheheeeee. 4. hidden chargers iâ€™m not sure how your house is, but every day that the kids are permitted to use electronics, itâ€™s a mad scramble for chargers. so i fixed that. i took them all away. gathered as many as i could find, and i shoved them in a fancy, little bag. and the really funny thing is that iâ€™m going to keep the bag right on the table, just as it is, to see who actually notices and who then saves the day. itâ€™ll be a lesson in noticing whatâ€™s around. kind of. 5. removed batteries even though wednesdays are â€˜unpluggedâ€™ days for us, another techy-trick i played is the ole battery removal trick. nothing fancy, friends. just a simple removal of the battery. and no, my kids donâ€™t all have phones. these are my husband and my older devices that the kids use as their â€˜mobile game playing stationâ€™ of sorts. i wonder who will be the first to catch onâ€“on thursday when they try to plug back in, that is! 6. water sports drinks we rarely have sports drinks around the house, but when we do, we often find â€˜floatersâ€™ around the house. gross. and. frustrating. because theyâ€™re not cheap. half-finished drinks from who knows when just sitting around here and there like weâ€™re a snack bar or something. so as a trick, i refilled the bottles. three of them. with water and a drop of our bright neon food coloring. just a few drops in each, and then i shook them up really good. and before school, iâ€™ll say, hey! i found these three last gatorades in the fridge. whose day is it? pick a flavorâ€“purple, blue, or red! (because when it comes down to it, arenâ€™t sports drinksâ€™ flavors colors and not real flavors? i mean really. and theyâ€™ll probably pick on and think they will have a super awesome drink for lunch. bwwhahaaaaa. 7. switched cereal ahhhhh, a simple one but a good one. switched the ole cereal bags inside the boxes. so when the kids try to pour the cereal, theyâ€™ll think theyâ€™re getting one thing but theyâ€™ll really get another. so tricky am i. so tricky. itâ€™s worth noting that i do all of this trickery because my kids can take it. if they became upset or angry or inconsolable when i tricked them like this, of course i wouldnâ€™t do it. theyâ€™re used to my april foolsâ€™ googly eyes. they know i usually do what i can to trick them or their father this time of the year. so theyâ€™ll be ready. i think. . . want some more ideas? our many hilarious ideas include: fake bug on pillow tape toilet paper roll edible eyes in cereal pudding coffee big googly eyes in shower jell-o juice real and play food confusion fake chicken wings & celery fake bug in shoe googly eyes everywhere googly eyes on sandwich family in news googly eyes on plant candy sushi squid dogs fake eggs and bacon more april foolsâ€™ day ideas: candy sushi fakinâ€™ & eggs 3 no-fail ways to get kids laughing on april foolsâ€™ day april foolsâ€™ tricks for family fun & easy april foolsâ€™ tricks for kids â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“ follow our board on pinterest for more april foolsâ€™ day ideas: follow amy mascott @teachmamaâ€™s board april foolsâ€™ & simple, silly tricks on pinterest. fyi: affilliate links used in this post related posts easy, super-silly april fools' tricks april fool's day is another holiday where i've leaned more toward the silly than theâ€¦ click to learn more april fools' trick: eggs and bacon eggs and bacon, anyone?
