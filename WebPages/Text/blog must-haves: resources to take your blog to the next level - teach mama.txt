(that means that more people come to me from pinterest than any other social media platform.) once every week or two, for 2-3 hours, i’ll schedule out my pins. tailwind makes that easy to do. i use tailwind tribes, which allows me to find and share pins with ‘tribes’ of users who i choose. it’s awesome, because as many of us know, sometimes it’s hard to find great content to share–and we certainly should not be sharing ours all of the time! that would get boring for our readers and followers. you can add pins manually or install a tailwind chrome extension which means that anywhere you are on the web, you simply click this little icon and can add the url to your scheduler. i love it. once you’ve set up your account, simply go to tailwind. click on publish. look toward the middle of the page and next to the mobile app button, you’ll see chrome extension. add it. start browsing and scheduling! you can even go straight to pinterest, find a favorite board, and then click the tailwind app icon. then you’ll get to a screen like the one below, and you can click on pins in bulk. it’s much easier to schedule that way. i love this app. before you’re finished scheduling pins for the day (or few weeks!), you can click ‘shuffle queue’ and all of your pins will be shuffled. that way you won’t push out a boatload from the same person consecutively. tailwind is easy. seriously try it. 6. if you have items to sell and want a storefront, use shopify. i love shopify. shopify is a platform where you can easily sell your products. super easy. and they have a very easy wordpress shopify plugin which you can use to make it all a lot easier. i don’t use the plugin; i keep my shop on the shopify site. i love that with the shopify membership, i can keep track of abandoned carts, i can connect seamlessly to convertkit (how awesome is that??!), and i can control coupons and sales. i. love. shopify. 7. if you want to make apparel but not buy upfront, use printful. i love printful. i use shopify in combination with printful to make the printing of my t-shirts and apparel easier. all of these awesome shirts? created with printful: i watched video after video about how to create the proper graphics, how to create mock-ups of each design, and how to position the items in the shopify store. it makes sense, friends. i sell hundreds and hundreds of cool shirts each month. check out printful. and definitely check out the teachmama shop. 8. if you want to totally rock instagram, use link in profile. i love link in profile. link in profile helps you generate clickable links in instagram. take a look at my instagram feed above. if you click on the image, you get an enlarged version of the photo with the caption and comments. but if you click on the url in my profile, linkinprofile.com/teachmama1, it will take you to a page where all you need to do is click any photo, and it will take you to a webpage. why do i love link in profile? because it makes every, single instagram photo a little more worth my time. sure, i want to grow my following, but i also want to have followers read my posts and do cool things i suggest and click my links and sometimes even buy things, right? right. so i simply add a link (a full link or an abbreviated bit.ly link) to every photo description, and when readers click the url in my bio, they are taken to the page above, on link in profile. on that page in link in profile, they can click any image, and they’re taken to the link. i love it. it’s like a shortcut, kind of. totally worth the few dollars a month it costs to host the link in profile page because i know me, and i know i’d never update a blog page on my own. 9. if you want to schedule instagram, use grum. i am new to grum–and i love, love, love it. grum allows you to schedule images from your computer to instagram. you can use hootsuite to schedule to instagram, but you have to be at your phone to finalize the send. it won’t automatically let you schedule to the platform. grum allows you to do that. and if you want a free month of grum, use the code teachmamafreemonth. go to the grum dashboard, then click ‘i have a coupon.’ enter teachmamafreemonth, and you’ll get a month for free. give it a shot and let me know what you think! 10. use wisestamp for your email signatures. i love wisestamp. wisestamp allows you to make cool email signatures with ease. more to come! need the basics? want to know how to set up a blog that rocks from the start? head over to check out this post: or quick list of favorites: for hosting: bluehost for design: studiopress by copyblogger social share buttons: socialwarfare for email marketing and newsletters: convertkit for photo editing: picmonkey for scheduling across twitter and facebook: hootsuite for scheduling pinterest: tailwind for a storefront: shopify for creating merchandise and customized apparel: printful for making instagram photos clickable: link in profile and?
