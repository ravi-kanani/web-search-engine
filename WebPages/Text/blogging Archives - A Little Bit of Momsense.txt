iâ€™m not 100% sure. but i plan on making it the year i full step into the light. the year i grow my social media and writing business. the year i help others carve out the time in their own lives they are craving for personal or professional creativity. i have big plans that involve me finally offering things i said i would for year. on this blog, i want to share more recipes, more stories, and possibly lean into my local love even further, while bringing my national readers tidbits that they can use and relate to. january is refreshing and this momentum feels amazing. in the meantime, i usually set out goals, intentions and even words to help guide the year. iâ€™m not one to make resolutions per se, but having a few ideas to keep me on track has always been helpful. and itâ€™s taken me a while to determine what a word to guide me might be but i think i finally found one: value. what i mean by value is that i need to appreciate my worth and value it. how i spend my time needs to have meaning and value (because itâ€™s so important to me). my rates need to reflect my value. my ideas and creative process is valuable to those who iâ€™m working with or collaborating with. i need to value my personal moments and those around me who help bring joy into my world. by remembering my own value, and realizing what i prioritize to be valuable, it will keep me focused and appreciative. so thatâ€™s that. the start to the new year has already begun and now that the kids are back in school i am feeling ready to create, plan, grow and succeed. how are you approaching 2019? rebecca 2 min read april 7, 2016 no reply online content: making a plan business this isnâ€™t a parenting post, but when iâ€™m not writing on this blog, i am doing some social media and freelance writing work. many of you know this already so iâ€™m happy to share this post with you! i create content all the time. if you are a blogger, community manager, brand rep or small business owner, you likely are too. every facebook update, every blog post, every newsletter draft â€“ it all is content in some form. i have presented at conferences like blissdom canada and social capital in ottawa about creating content. it takes some planning, and in some cases some patience. iâ€™ve teamed up with lara wellman to bring a one-day learning and planning day to ottawa. we are going to be working with entrepreneurs, those in communications, virtual assistance and bloggers to help create a framework for digital content that will see us into the end of the year. by focusing on newsletters, blogging, facebook, instagram and goal-setting, participants will be working hard to fill out workbooks that will be their action plan for the next few months. iâ€™m super excited because iâ€™ve been helping people create content for years, and now have a way to really take the stress out of it for many. why should you attend? if you own a business, are starting up a business, work at home, are a virtual assistant or blogger i think youâ€™ll take home a lot from the day. youâ€™ll get: -delicious food and plenty of coffee to fuel your hard work -a workbook with actionable planning items that you customize and fill in as the day goes on. this will help build your framework. -a lot of tips and tools that you can use to create better content more efficiently. -a run down of facebook and instagram and how to apply them to your business. -networking with other small business owners -a clear direction on what to do next to create your best content â€¦and much more! this day isnâ€™t only about learning itâ€™s about doing. we know how hard it can be to take the time to fill out plans and goals and set dates, but investing that time will save you more time and stress in the future. we want to help. interested? you can visit the website to register. the early bird ends april 8 so thatâ€™s the time to buy (and for blog readers use code rebeccavipfcd to save 15%). if you invest in this day, it will save you so much time in the future! message me if you have any questions! rebecca 6 min read june 3, 2015 4 replies thinking about heading to blissdom canada this year? blogging, small business, social media tickets for blissdom canada (october 15-18) are on sale now, and if you saw on facebook or in their newsletters, i am one of the fortunate people who have been asked to be a blissdom ambassador this year! whatâ€™s that mean? itâ€™s a variation on the old community leader role and first and foremost means i, and the other ambassadors, are here to help answer your questions about the conference leading up to it and over the course of the weekend. think of us like cheer leaders and coaches all in one â€“ we want to help and answer your questions along the way. i have a fun offer for you if you buy a ticket thinking about buying a ticket? one of my perks as an ambassador is that i get a small affiliate bonus when you use my link to buy. this link. open it, save it ðŸ˜‰ but, i want to make sure i say a thank you to you for not only using my link, but also investing in yourself. i get it. this is a big decision. itâ€™s the same thought process i have each year when i spend the money. as a thank you, i am offering up a small gift to everyone who uses my link (just let me know if you use my link to buy your ticket and iâ€™ll be in touch) and as time goes on iâ€™ll probably add a few things. also, if you buy a ticket with this link, let me know so we can get excited together â€“ and i can help answer any questions you have about getting ready for the conference. in addition, iâ€™m going to do a draw for a 1 hour one-on-one coaching session that will focus on your blog and social media in preparation for blissdom for to lead you into the fall. i will help one of you (maybe more ðŸ˜‰ to really maximize the weekend. i will help you take some steps so that you can see the roi that iâ€™ve seen in the past. naturally, whether you use my link or not, i want to help. so feel free to send me your questions, your concerns, etc. any time. thatâ€™s my job as an ambassador! all of the ambassadors for blissdom are a fun, welcoming group so you can catch any of us when you arenâ€™t sure about something. it will be fun, and business focused ðŸ˜‰ finding pictures of myself at blissdom are always interesting. i make a lot of faces when i speak ðŸ˜‰ why should you attend blissdom? iâ€™ve been to blissdom every year but the first (and even for that one i had a ticket but ended up not being able to go). i wrote a post on their website last year about why i think itâ€™s a good business investment. iâ€™m boring that way. while i would love to tell you how much fun youâ€™ll have (you will) and how nice it is to be in a room of other like-minded business people (itâ€™s fantastic) and how there is inspiration seeping out of everywhere all weekend, i wonâ€™t just focus on that. instead i can chat about it being a good business decision. because at the end of the day, i canâ€™t invest in these conferences (which we all know arenâ€™t free) just for the fun of it. it doesnâ€™t work for me that way. we shouldnâ€™t dismiss the fun aspect though. we work hard, and having fun and meeting up with friends from across the country has itâ€™s own value. there is something so rewarding about being in a room of people who get what you do on a day to day basis and who together can inspire and motivate us. that is valuable. every year i leave wanting to do better, work harder and improve in the blogging community. no matter what, i do believe in investing in myself and my business. maybe you are in a creative rut, maybe you are a new blogger, maybe you are a veteran blogger looking for your next project; whatever the case, this conference will cover that. thereâ€™s also opportunity for roi. like it or not, it does come down to money for many of us when we make business decisions and in this case, the opportunity for roi is great. iâ€™ve met brands that i have worked with, partners, clients â€“ the opportunities are what you make of them. it takes some work of course. but being there, in person, makes a difference, thatâ€™s one thing iâ€™ve learned over the years. thinking about going? make a plan for what you want to be doing with the blog or on social media in 3 months, in 6 months and in 12 months. this will help you determine what you want to take away from blissdom. before you buy, check out this contest now wait donâ€™t buy your ticket yet. right now blissdom has a contest for those of you who have been before. they are looking for your success stories and by sending them in you have a chance to win your ticket. if you donâ€™t win, then head back over and buy ðŸ˜‰ enter by june 14! once youâ€™ve bought your ticket, be sure to let me know so i can keep track for my draw and fun stuff, plus we can chat away! blissdom canada is already shaping up to be huge this year. i really hope to see you there! iâ€™m including a picture of these corn dogs. they were delicious. i regret not eating more. consider it a metaphor for going to the event. donâ€™t regret not eating the corn dogs! photo credits: from the blissdom canada flickr account disclosure: this post contains an affiliate link. and a lot of rambling ðŸ˜‰ rebecca 5 min read may 28, 2015 2 replies working at home: preparing for the summer blogging, business, lifestyle has your family started a summer countdown? for those of you who know me, i am always excited this time of year. we are inching our way closer to summer holidays and i love that. my son has a countdown in his room and talks about it every day. june is always a busy month at school (mostly with field trips and fun) so they love that, we have spring sports in the evenings, activities on the weekend and work always is busy in june for both andy and i. ah yes, work. when you are a work-at-home parent, summer holidays look a little differently. during the year, i donâ€™t work full time, i keep my hours low to ensure i have time for school volunteering and random house stuff, but it doesnâ€™t mean that the summer wonâ€™t be a balance of deadlines and park visits. in my case, i am lucky because andy takes the summer off which means when i have a meeting, i donâ€™t have to arrange child care (although my parents are fantastic to help out.) but it still means iâ€™m trying to get work done so that i can take off on holidays or have some fun with everyone. each summer, i have more clients and more hours of work to do as the kids get older. here are some tips for fellow work-at-home parents who will be balancing kids and work. 1- start planning now itâ€™s really not that far away. itâ€™s time to start thinking about how your summer hours are affected. in my case, i also work with a lot of work-at-home parents, so i need to find out what their plans are for the summer too. the planning has already begun. donâ€™t wait! in addition, now is the time to start setting expectations for everyone. chat with clients or partners about what your summer hours look like, update your business website with closures or â€˜no shipâ€™ dates if applicable, and get everyone ready for july and august. 2- determine your child care needs do you need to sign the kids up for camp? which weeks? will your partner be home at all? do you have back up people to call when a last minute meeting or request comes up? look at the entire summer plan. 3- mark your calendars look at your family and work calendar from june 1 until the beginning of school and start marking dates into both. yes, that entire time. make sure that you mark days off from your work calendar when you know you will be away, or the kids have an event. in my case, iâ€™m already blocking dates for june field trips, moving meetings around, pushing some into july when i know child care is easier, and so on. i also do this with client holidays. 4- use those calendars to set deadlines if you are travelling on august 1, you donâ€™t want to leave something until july 31. set some deadline dates for yourself, and mark them on your calendar. when a client requests something, or a blogging opportunity comes up, youâ€™ll be able to see if you can accommodate it, not only based on your holiday schedule, but also your deadline schedule. 5- create a plan if you donâ€™t already use an editorial calendar (or a project plan), now is the time to start. i use excel and mark off ideas, dates, links, client work, deadlines etc. so that each day i can see whatâ€™s coming up. 6- block work time during the day my best work time is the morning. from about 7-9 i get as much as i can done and the kids know iâ€™m working. the kids are happy to have free time, and by about 9:30 we have plans to head out to a park or play date. when they are in school, i have the lunch hour/early afternoon to get things done, but in the summer i tend to shift this to a later afternoon time because iâ€™m often out or busy. know when your kids have their best time and work with that too. 7- some days, itâ€™s not going to be all fun and games deadline days may mean that the kids are going to have to step away from any camp home agenda for a bit and figure out their own fun (which, for the most part, is highly encouraged anyway, right?) i donâ€™t feel guilty if i have to duck my head at the laptop and get it done one day, especially when we spend the summer doing a lot of fun things together. 8- donâ€™t miss out reduce your hours in the summer if you need to, or shift your work time, but donâ€™t miss out if you want to take the kids to the museum or play a board game on a hot afternoon. have fun, even in the chaos. what are your tips for working at home while the kids are around? share them below! rebecca 1 min read july 8, 2012 2 replies extra reading â€“ writing here and there blogging this week has just flown by. it has been our first full week of school being over and between our trip to toronto, play dates and andyâ€™s family coming in from out of town, iâ€™m having trouble accepting that itâ€™s sunday already. iâ€™ve still been a busy bee (or at least trying to be) â€“ in addition to this blog, iâ€™ve been writing a few other places. iâ€™d love it if you checked out the following links: as part of my mom central partnership as a disney junior mom, i was selected to write an article for disney junior canada that not only is on their website but was also sent to their many, many newsletter subscribers. that was exciting!! the article: win, lose and play i have a new gig writing for a pretty awesome company called beautygram. jennifer the owner is a spark of savvy and fun and iâ€™m honoured to be writing some blogs for her. itâ€™s fun for me to write about topics i donâ€™t always get to. check out the beautygram i was sent as a thank you. what a great gift to get! there was a lot of discussion on twitter about the orange fashion post and the latest one discloses just how terrible my purse organization is. meanwhile, iâ€™m still writing true blood recaps on kellidaisy.com because, well, i love the show and want to talk about hot vampires. july will continue to be pretty busy but the highlight will be our trip to pei. whatâ€™s on your list of â€˜awesome happeningsâ€™ for july?

(the best way is to sign up to this blog by email â€“ wink wink) in january, our first mind her business workshop took place that amanda degrace, gwen leron and myself co-organized. i think it was a huge success and most importantly it really helped me set some goals and plans while there. we hope to continue with some events which i usually post on my facebook page. plus, you may have been reading about my advertisers? can i just say how awesome they are? it may help that iâ€™m also a customer for most of them (some before they were advertisers!) but really, having the ability to work with such businesses is a pleasure and if you get a chance, check them out. they are worth it! iâ€™m also working on a few other things but itâ€™s all a little hush hush right now but over the next couple of months more will be shaking. meanwhile, i continue to write about a little bit of everything on this blog, where my true writing heart lies. when i think about writing about kindness, and kid activities, and house renos, and television â€“ i realize that i am really writing about the life of a mom arenâ€™t i? thereâ€™s no rhyme or reason, no one topic that we focus on. just a little bit of everything. and i like that ðŸ˜‰ wishing you a kind week!! rebecca 6 min read october 18, 2011 39 replies blissdom canada recap: what i learned and where do we go from here? parenting on thursday until saturday i attended blissdom canada â€“ a conference to discuss social media, public relations, blogging and online engagement. i feel like i am still processing everything, but wow i had such a great time. it was likely the combination of learning (which i love to do) and seeing/connecting with so many people that i donâ€™t get to hang with every day (and some that i get to see more often but was able to have a blast with â€“ ottawa peeps iâ€™m looking at you!). iâ€™ve decided to write out short lists to summarize the ocean of thoughts i have about the past couple of days in my head. thereâ€™s just so much swimming around up there, i need to get it down and break it apart. my favourite parts (and the stuff they canâ€™t accurately describe on the website) meeting people that i have spoken with online for years, but donâ€™t live near me. there were hugs (some awkward) and laughing and awesomeness. seeing people that i donâ€™t get to see nearly enough. sometimes it seems like toronto and the surrounding area is so close. then i remember how far it is because so many people i love to be with are there. ottawa represents â€“ we are a fun crowd. can i say that? ottawa is special. seriously, yes, iâ€™m bragging, but we are our own community. itâ€™s an inclusive group and we support each other. love it. i got to dress up! ok, thatâ€™s not what itâ€™s all about, but i donâ€™t get to do it often and it was fun. i am surrounded by talented and supportive people. how many times did i get to congratulate talented women this weekend on their new/continuing ventures? how many did i get to listen to talk about their strengths and share their goals and tips. countless. i felt loved all weekend. secret: all that chatting and meeting with people and mingling is stressful for me. no, really it is. it exhausts me. i do it because itâ€™s rewarding â€“ people are fun and i really have fun! but my anxieties leave me feeling silly sometimes or thinking i sounded like a dork (and yes, sometimes i did ha!). and yet, i never once felt judged. or unwelcome. or foolish. i felt like i was with my people. and it was during the opening remarks that i realized that. (sara and i: photo by cl buchanan photography) what i learned: from panels to conversations â€“ taking it back to the blog i want to improve my writing, but do to that i need to keep finding my voice. but to do that, i have to be less guarded. no matter what though, i get to decide where to go with it (and i like that!) i love doing what iâ€™m doing â€“ blogging, sharing, connecting. itâ€™s a perfect fit for me. i write about community giving and even if my blog is small, i think my online voice has a way to help. i love helping others â€“ other bloggers, small business owners. even if itâ€™s just sharing an idea or offer small piece of â€˜how toâ€™ help, i really want to continue to do that. my blog is my business. the minute i decided to monetize i had to start treating it like that. i have to get my admin in even better order. i donâ€™t need to work with brands to be a good blogger. i will remain selective of those i work with. i love bit of foodsense and it needs some more attention â€“ which i am going to give it. whatâ€™s next? more blogging on bit of foodsense. better time management for bit of momsense so i can focus only on great content â€“ and those brands/advertisers i work with that are the best fit for me and my readers. make more time to connect with people. iâ€™ve been able to do it more in ottawa, but now i want to see all those awesome toronto area people more! learn to write better. chip away at some of the walls i put up, the lack of confidence and work to improve my writing. areas iâ€™d love to see focused on next year: focus on social media and small business/entrepreneurs the business of blogging â€“ the conversation about monetization has been open, but if we are going to monetize, it becomes a business. what does that mean? whatâ€™s different? how small blogs make a difference, are of value and have their own niche. stats are important and tell a story but they arenâ€™t everything. more time for connecting outside of sessions â€“ this may be impossible but thereâ€™s so much value in it! eta (just thought of this): community management and jobs/careers in/about social media conferences like these are incredible work to put together, and i canâ€™t thank the organizers enough for hosting a wonderful weekend. this was my first time and i loved it. meeting everyone and participating was valuable for not only my blog but more importantly for me. if you were at blissdom and i didnâ€™t get to meet you, iâ€™m sorry. and i mean that because as i had suggested to others, i wish there was a way to meet every participant in a reception line (or speed dating way as someone said) just to be able to put names and faces together. the smiles of so many lovely people warmed my heart and lifted me in ways that canâ€™t be explained. lastly, i ate supper at a place with sushi on mini boats that floated around where we sat and i could grab sushi off the boats. sure, maybe it was the company that made this a hilarious and fun time, but it was pretty awesome. ðŸ™‚ thanks for the memories and motivation blissdom canada! rebecca 1 min read may 12, 2011 6 replies cityline blogger of the month blogging you could imagine the excitement i felt a couple of weeks ago when suzanne from cityline online contacted me to let me know that i am the cityline blogger of the month! a little bit of momsense is going to be featured for the month of may on their website. i did a phone interview talking about blogging and why i feel this is a really great space for me. please take a peak at the extremely kind write up on their website. in the meantime, if youâ€™re swinging by this blog after reading about me on cityline, hello and welcome! i just returned from a family vacation in toronto and niagara and will be posting more about travelling with the family soon. we do a lot of road trips so iâ€™m learning some tips and tricks each time! looking forward to all the new and exciting things happening in this space. thanks for stopping by and reading, commenting and chatting! rebecca 2 min read april 27, 2010 17 replies welcome to the new a little bit of momsense uncategorized here it is â€“ the new home of a little bit of momsense! itâ€™s got a new look. itâ€™s got a nifty, personal url. it still has the same content â€“ food, family, fun, freebies. it still is a work in progress, but i hope you enjoy it. take a peak at the top pages â€“ they all have to be filled out more but itâ€™s a start. iâ€™ll be adding some more items to the side bars, including logos for sites that i write for or love. finding giveaways and reviews will be made easier, and iâ€™ll finally have a pitch policy developed. after working with a wonderful designer (gemma from mg moore designs â€“ an ontario mom who exhibited a lot of patience with me!) itâ€™s really looking like something, i think. i am proud of this site and the communication i have with my readers. i hope you continue to read and visit. ðŸ™‚ there are still some glitches â€“ i havenâ€™t been able to import all of my comments â€“ many are missing. and iâ€™m still learning some of the coding for certain links plus i need to categorize all my posts to make them easier to search. i need to make sure that subscribers get moved over etc! but thatâ€™s part of the fun, right?
