petite anglaise august 27, 2009 quickie filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 2:52 pm in honour of official ‘french kissing’ publication day, i just wanted to answer a lot of the queries i’ve been receiving on facebook and by email about the novel’s availability abroad. as things currently stand, i only have a doubleday canada release date – march 2010. the penguin uk version should be available in the high street bookshops in the uk, throughout the commonwealth and in a selection of english language bookshops abroad (including wh smiths in paris). in the meantime, if you are outside the uk and wish to get your hands on a copy, your best bet is probably to order it from the book depository – it’s reasonably priced and they will ship it anywhere in the world for free. i do hope you enjoy it. so. shameless self-promotion over. i shall now go back to fretting about what my friends and family think of it. aie! comments (37) july 4, 2009 à titre d'information… filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:42 pm our little family of three (plus bump) is heading to turkey (more specifically, to the lycian coast) for two weeks, so things will be (even) quieter than usual around here. in the meantime, i leave you with the cover of my first novel, published as a paperback original in late august in the uk (to follow in march 2010 in canada), which is now available for pre-order on amazon.co.uk and elsewhere online. those of you who have been paying attention will note that i’d originally titled the book ‘rendez-vous’ – which is also the name of the online dating site featured in the story. the marketing powers-that-be decided to go with ‘french kissing’ instead, and i’d be quite interested to hear which title people prefer… comments (76) june 4, 2009 feeling blue filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 9:48 am i just happened to spot the new cover for the random house paperback edition of petite, published in the us and canada on 9 june (which i suspect will be overshadowed by tadpole’s birthday, on the very same day!) i had no idea it was going to be blue, and while i like the shade very much (as my wardrobe can testify), i can’t help thinking that it clashes somewhat with my blog colour scheme… if you are on the other side of the pond, you can order a copy from amazon us or amazon canada, or from your local bookstore. hopefully my author copies will be making an appearance in my letter box any day now. comments (41) february 5, 2009 package filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 4:49 pm at the risk of upsetting those of my readers who find self-promotion irritating, i just wanted to share with you the contents of the package that arrived this afternoon. it occurs to me that tadople may be a little vexed when she comes home from school and realises she is no longer a cover ‘star’ but, all in all, i’m very pleased with the book in its newest incarnation. so, um, paperback petite should now be widely available in uk bookshops and supermarkets for as little as £4.00 (that’s the current going rate on amazon, via the link to the right). the eagle-eyed among you will also note that there’s a trip to paris on eurostar up for grabs via a competition lurking within. as of next week i shall be absconding to belize with the boy on my honeymoon in a bid to avoid teh internets in general (and amazon rankings, in particular). i’ll be back to wow you with blurry photos of underwater fauna at the beginning of march. comments off on package older posts » search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
