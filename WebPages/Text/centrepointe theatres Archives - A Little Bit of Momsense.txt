yay! isn’t that exciting? now, if you have the books at home, then you are likely already familiar with their antics (and how loveable they are.) why not bring more elephant and piggie love into your home with some activities? with march break this week, it’s the perfect opportunity to keep the kids happily busy. if you don’t have any elephant and piggie books at home, check out the local library. they are definitely worth reading! i found this teacher kit with activities that you can print out at home. there’s a maze, and guided activities to do based on the characters. i love all of the interactive options and the activities really capture the nature of the characters too. this would be a fun way to spend your morning before you head to the live show at centrepointe theatres! in addition, why not make this bookmark with your child? it’s easy to do so with a little hands-on help. younger children can make one for their favourite elephant and piggie book too. what you need to create this elephant and piggie bookmark: first, print out page 12 from the activity book (link here) at a reduced size (i used 8×5 in the printer selection) then, your child can colour in elephant and piggie! meanwhile, cut a piece of card stock – width-wise about 2 inches (you’ll end up with a piece that is about 2 inches by 8 inches). your child can colour that if they like! we’ve left it blank. cut out the elephant and piggie images from the coloured page and glue them on your bookmark. my daughter wanted one on each side so that’s what we did. personalize the bookmark with your child’s name, or, in this case, we used scrapbook stickers to add elephant and piggie’s names. now, they are on a bookmark! if you want to do more elephant and piggie crafts and will be attending the stage show, head to the centrepointe theatres an hour before the show begins to participate in the nepean visual arts centre’s craft time (click here to see what your child can make!) don’t forget to buy your tickets to elephant and piggie’s “we are in a play!” *centrepointe theatres is a blog advertiser. rebecca 2 min read march 2, 2017 2 replies elephant and piggie are coming to centrepointe theatres on march 25! around ottawa this family loves the elephant and piggie series of books by mo willems. have you read them with your children? i find the two characters enduring and fun and the way the stories are told are engrossing from the start. this is, to me, exactly how a children’s book should be. you may remember reading that my daughter chose to read an elephant and piggie in french for the speaking competition at the school last year (you can read about that here). it was an easy decision for her once we found the french book at the library. she even did the voices! that’s why i am so excited to share that centrepointe theatres is hosting elephant and piggie’s “we are in a play!” on march 25! i’m less excited that we are unable to attend ourselves because of other commitments, but i am over the moon to tell you all about it and excited that other families can be introduced to these lovable characters. this is a live action musical that was written by mo willems himself. the show is recommended for kindergarten and grade one students, but i know for a fact that my older kids would enjoy it. i imagine this will be a popular show. buy your tickets today to avoid disappointment. what’s even better is that if you attend the show ahead of time, from 12 pm until 1 pm, the nepean visual arts center is hosting a pre-show craft. the kids can make their own elephant and piggies! this would be a fun way to introduce kids to musical theatre and share in some fun. also, stay tuned to this blog – i have a couple more things to share with you about elephant and piggie that you won’t want to miss, especially if you are a fan like we are! elephant and piggie are in a play at @centrepointet on march 25! buy your tickets today #ottawa! click to tweet watch a preview here: rebecca 1 min read february 2, 2017 no reply lisa loeb family sing along- coming to centrepointe theatres in ottawa around ottawa so you remember lisa loeb’s ‘stay’ right? it played often on our local radio station and as a 14 year old it brings me back to all of those teen emotions. her melodic voice really is lovely. now, we can introduce our kids to lisa loeb’s talent. she has a family sing along coming to centrepointe theatres! how fun is that? join the sing along on february 18th (yes, that’s family day long weekend!) at 2 pm. tickets are available for purchase now. you can visit the centrepointe theatres website to buy tickets or preview some of the songs. i think kids will love this show no doubt; everyone in the family will be singing along! this is an all ages show. i’ve said it many times before that i love bringing the kids to live stage shows. it’s even better when there’s music involved. this is like an introductory concert for preschoolers. i have no doubt the crowd will love this performance, especially the smallest of audience members. want more details? visit the centrepointe theatres website. rebecca 1 min read december 12, 2016 no reply around ottawa: max and ruby at centrepointe theatres around ottawa start a new family holiday tradition by heading to a live show! max and ruby and the nutcracker suite is coming to centrepointe theatres on december 15 with two shows! with performances at 3:30 and 6:30 pm on thursday night, your entire family can delight at this performance. max and ruby were often on tv when my kids were younger and as parents i think we all have had a laugh at their antics with a bit of tongue firmly planted in cheek at times (where were their parents?!) but the duo continue to be childhood favourites and a holiday performance on stage could be the start of a new tradition for your family! i love taking the kids to live shows, and this time of year it’s nice to get out and spend that time together, especially since we are all so busy. i love the nutcracker music, and the dancing of course will be lovely. tied to the characters of max and ruby, this is such a sweet way to introduce your children to a classic holiday performance that is kid-friendly for them. show up early to the performance to participate in the nepean visual arts centre craft activity as well. grab your tickets soon before they are sold out!. check out the trailer below for a sneak peek! centrepointe theatres is a blog advertiser. rebecca 0 min read april 29, 2015 no reply save $5 on the upcoming pedal punk performance at centrepointe theatres! around ottawa on may 2, blog advertiser centrepointe theatre is hosting cirque mechanics pedal punk! this is no average stage show! in pedal punk you’ll encounter unicycles that fly, wheel acrobats that hover, cyclists that whirl, pole climbers that soar and trapeze artists that float. the show draws inspiration from the culture of steam punk, where a post- apocalyptic world of machines is powered by steam. pedal punk’s “steam” power comes from the acrobatic strength of the artists. the show takes place on may 2 at 7:30 pm. maybe it’s the perfect date night activity?
