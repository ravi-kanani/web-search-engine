except for our spend, save, and give jars from way back when, we have not done much in terms of teaching our kids how to save or the importance of being money smart–financially literate. sure, we gave our kids ways to earn money with gem jars as they got older, but we never really taught them how to budget. how to save. how to plan. or why it’s necessary. i learned a ton from these resources on earn your future digital lab, and i’m amazed that they’re available for anyone–any parent or teacher to use. here’s the skinny. . . cool, interactive tool for teaching kids financial literacy: this whole thing may sound pretty crazy and complicated, but it’s not. the earn your future digital lab makes things pretty easy and straightforward once you register as a parent or teacher on the site. when you get to the site, you’ll see a screen like this: register. register, my friend, to get the fun rolling. registration is simple and will only take you a minute or two for parents or teachers. goodness knows that we’re all so busy we hardly have time to learn one more platform, right? this one, my friends, is easy. i promise it will take a second. they’ve made it really easy for you to add a student (or child, if you’re a parent) or to import a class list from a .csv file. if you’re a parent and you’d rather not add students (like i did above, because i’m a really big nerd), you can simply have your child access the earn your future digital lab by clicking on the ‘launch earn your future digital lab’. once on the screen, kids can choose either: level 1 (beginner): content designed for kids in grades 3-5 [coming in fall of 2016!] level 2 (intermediate): content designed for kids in grades 6-8 [focus: help them plan for their future and make smart decisions about money.] level 3 (advanced): content designed for kids in grades 9-12 [focus: prepare students for life after high school and a look at careers, income, saving, credit, budgeting, home buying, risk insurance, stock market, and more.] we only really looked at the level 2 resources since maddy is in grade six. in level 2, there are seven sections to explore: module 1: mortgage mystery module 2: truth or dare? module 3: can i afford a phone? module 4: too good to be true? module 5: what’s your interest? module 6: #link2yourfuture maddy looked closely at several modules over time, and i think we both learned a lot. kids can earn ‘badges’ for each module they complete. you know we all love a little pat on the back when we finish something with success. . . each section is interactive and packed with information. i mean packed. like any solid lesson or unit plan, the modules contain pre-tests, reminders, mini-quizzes to check for understanding, repetition of material, and engaging, interactive components. the support and resources available is astonishing. really. each module contains printable teacher guides, introduction videos, related videos, and more. i actually almost couldn’t believe how much support was there–but it needs to be! some of these topics are pretty confusing for kids — and adults! the lessons provide a ton of talking points and conversation starters for kids and parents; the pwc charitable foundation also includes more related resources on their website. they’re organized both by topic and age level. you can grab them here: additional financial literacy resources. and really, i’ve said this before, but it’s worth repeating: the resources are amazing. though this is a late beginning for us as far as raising financially literate children, i’m excited. i really am. i’m excited about these resources. i’m excited about this opportunity. i’m excited that i get to share this with you, and i’m excited that all of our kids will learn a bit thanks to the earn your future digital lab. and i’m excited that i get to learn a bit, too. what do you think? is this something that you will check out with your kids? might you pass on these resources to your child’s school or teachers? i’d love to hear it! fyi: this post was written as part of a partnership with pwccharitable foundation, but as always, all opinions are my own, influenced only by my experience as a parent and educator. related posts 30 days of financial fitness: 3 cool resources to raise financial literacy in kids as a parent and educator, i know it is super important that my kids learn… click to learn more 3 cool kids, 3 cool books: what we're reading now it's hard to find books that work for your kids. i totally get… click to learn more literacy lava 3 is here! literacy lava 3 is here! and i am super-excited to be a contributor...it's another great… click to learn more comments comments 04 | 14 | 2016 comments lindsey says april 21, 2016 at 4:59 pm this is one of the coolest resources i’ve seen in a long time! i can’t wait until they come out with the beginner level. my daughter is 3 now, so it will be perfect timing to start doing this a little every day come next fall. tweeting, pinning and stumbling this post. <3 reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website our books & freebies email sign-up: success! now quickly head over and check your email to confirm your subscription. you don't want to miss this! there was an error submitting your subscription. please try again. email address subscribe archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 search this site tags 0-2 years 3-5 years 6-8 years 9-12 years alphabet behavior books cooking cool & creative counting crafts creative kids critical thinking digital literacy early literacy elementary schoolers family fun family life family time fine motor skills food games giveaway giving back gratitude holidays homework time indoor learning listening math middle schoolers new for us friday outdoor learning parenting preschoolers printables read-aloud learning reading school science speaking sponsored post summer fun vlogs writing instagram recent pins more pins you tube check out our channel! about contact disclaimer terms of use privacy policy site-map copyright © 2020 · teach mama media, llc · designed by smitten blog designs · privacy policy · log in 959 959shares
