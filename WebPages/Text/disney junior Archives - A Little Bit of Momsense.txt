now, the first movie is airing when my guys will be in bed so i will be setting the pvr for sure! i think a certain soon-to-be birthday girl may find this dvd as a birthday gift this year too. also, stick around (or set the pvr!) because right after cinderella is the series premiere of sofia the first on at 7pm est! if you watched the show when disney junior had the sneak peek before, you’ll know this story of a little girl who’s mother marries a king and is swept into a new life as a princess. it’s about caring, friendship and being yourself. we loved it! if you are wondering, sundays at 11:30am est will become the regular time slot for the new sofia the first series! everyone ready? happy watching! rebecca 2 min read december 8, 2012 no reply disney junior christmas specials and online fun kids, parenting the television and pvr is in full gear now with holiday shows. have you been watching? my problem is that i always intend to watch, miss them and forget to pvr – i still find having pvr is new and i don’t use it enough yet!! we sat as a family last saturday, december 1, for our first #25daysofchristmas advent activity – it was to watch a christmas movie. so we watched mickey’s once upon a christmas. parents, you may remember these clips from when we were younger. but i would be lying if i said i didn’t tear up when huey, dewey and louie didn’t find what makes christmas special in their hearts and learned to enjoy the moment. today was the airing of the newer clips together in mickey’s twice upon a christmas. pvr fail, i missed it this morning so i found that it’s on again just before 4 pm tomorrow! meanwhile, my daughter has discovered the new holiday games on the website (you can build e-cards!) and they get two thumbs up from her. this one was probably her favourite, because it required me to go out and buy candy canes to finish the image. her and her brother coloured this and are pretty proud. i think it’s a very cute idea (and easy for you to set up!) also, the santa buddies movie will be on next saturday, december 15 at 11 am. talking puppies save christmas! 😉 have you been catching some of these holiday favourites? you’ll start to see your regular favourites play some holiday episodes too – i’ve already seen imagination movers, handy manny and others have some on (and look on demand if you have it! some of these episodes often end up there for frequent viewing 🙂 disclosure: i’m part of the disney junior mom program and i receive special perks as part of my affiliation with this group. the opinions on this blog are my own. i want to watch the holiday shows because they remind me of when i was a kid. i will never admit to enjoying the talking dog movies even though they are cute 🙂 rebecca 2 min read november 21, 2012 no reply a new show on disney junior – sofia the first! kids, parenting disney junior is has a sneak peek for a brand new show on saturday, november 24 at 7 pm. the series will launch in january 2013. sofia the first is the story of a little girl whose mom marries a king. sofia then becomes a princess and has to learn what that means, all while trying to adjust to her new family (including her new dad and two step-siblings). we received a copy of the sofia the first book from disney junior as an introduction into the show. the story focuses on sofia’s enthusiasm for her new life, and her concerns about fitting in. there is some tension with her new sister at first, but all is resolved by the end. i really liked that this is about a blended family, that the step-siblings, although had some initial conflict, worked things out, and that the princess school was teaching her about kindness and important values. plus, the characters seemed very cute and fun. when i asked my daughter what she liked best about the book, she said ‘cinderella!’. that’s because cinderella makes an appearance (and she will in the show as well!). my son also really liked the book and is anxious to watch the show “can you tape it mom? i’ll be in bed when it’s on). we all can’t wait to watch this new show, and the book is a keeper! want to win your own copy? you can!! disney junior has a contest right now where you can win 1 of 150 storybook prize packs that include the book and more!! enter the sofia the first contest! will you be watching sofia the first?

i keep seeing bits and pieces of different ones. this saturday morning you can watch handy manny plus many more. on halloween, there will be costumed episodes all day long! if your kids are allowed on the computer, check out the halloween section of the disney junior website – fun games and colouring pages are available. these are great episodes for the kids to watch while you are making costumes, carving pumpkins, sparkling decorations and more! or while you are on pinterest looking at the halloween decor you want to do?

(and i have jake to thank for the time to write this post 🙂 disclosure: this post is brought to you by our friends at mom central as a disney junior mom, but my opinions, comments and realization that i should buy cinderella are all my own 😉 rebecca 2 min read august 13, 2012 no reply capture the memories: new disney junior walt disney world trip contest blogging let’s pretend for a moment that you and your family won a trip to walt disney world (me: omg omg omg what if i won a trip to disney world? omg i would freak). sorry. was distracted for a minute. let’s keep pretending. now let’s pretend as part of that $10,000 prize package you not only got transportation to and from disney, but also accommodations and of course park passes. and in addition, there were other perks like a pirate or princess make over (for your little one) and a chance to dine with a disney character. we’re still pretending, but let’s pretend you win all of this. all of it and more. which character would your children want to dine with? how about we stop pretending for a second and i tell you how exactly you have a chance to win this for real. for real. head over to the disney junior website and check out the contest details and enter. you have until august 31, 2012 to enter (and can do so once a day!). looking for bonus entries? watch disney junior for magic words that you can enter online for additional chances to win. disney is on our short-term trip planning list. i am thinking maybe 2 years. i’ve been twice in my life – once as an 11 year old and once as a teenager and both times were amazing. i can’t wait to take my kids and see the magically looks on their faces when we watch the fireworks, or the parades, or go on the rides or meet their favourite characters. i can’t wait. but now, someone has the chance to win this fabulous prize. go on, enter. pretend and imagine for a little while longer too. because if there is one thing that disney is fantastic at, it’s helping us to remember what it’s like to have an imagination and be kids again. good luck!! disclosure: i’m part of the disney junior mom program and i receive special perks as part of my affiliation with this group. the opinions on this blog are my own. rebecca 3 min read july 17, 2012 1 reply packing challenge: 4 people in one suitcase. think we can do it? family travel, lifestyle, travel we are continuing vacation preparation. we are lucky enough to be test driving a ford flex for the duration of our drive. i’m looking forward to checking it out for the trip. i love our van, but our van is getting older so it will be interesting to compare the two. my biggest need in a car? comfort on the long drive and space for everything (and everyone). i feel we are finally at a point in our travel/parent lives where we don’t end up packing half of the house when we hit the road. when we went on road trips with the kids as babies, there were play pens, exersaucers, booster seats, diapers, toys and more that came with us. now for our trip out east we are mostly packing clothes (which i keep saying i will not bring as many as i did last year), some books and videos, sports stuff (baseball gloves, soccer ball), beach toys, beach wear and some food. i am rather convinced that i can get all of the clothing for the 4 of us in one suitcase. you read that right (i’ll try and take a picture and post on my facebook page if we do it!). we do have laundry at the cottage. i over packed last year and found that i didn’t wear 2/3 of the clothes i brought. i need my swimsuit, a cover up for beach days, and a few shorts/shirts for when we were in town. the kids need swim suits and a few changes of clothes and ditto for andy. we aren’t going to fancy restaurants and even though we’ll each bring a pair of pants and a sweater, we don’t need oodles of them. what’s frustrating is we can’t pack too early. it never works well. there’s always the last minute rush no matter what i do. i’m better off finishing laundry on wednesday/thursday and packing then. then, andy – the super packer – will magically make everything fit. seriously, it’s a miracle. despite my loathing, we are beyond excited to be going. we are really ready for a vacation with just the four of us! meanwhile, i’m trying to keep the house tidy and the kids busy/happy while crossing items off our list. here’s where my plug comes in 😉 disney junior is having marathons each morning of the shows our kids love to watch. we are huge fans of their programming (doc mcstuffins and jake and the neverland pirates are pretty popular right now) plus there are movies happening all summer long on monday nights. we pvred a tinkerbell one last week that was a huge hit! so while i’m packing, the kids are playing, running around or enjoying some quiet time. i can just pop on a pvred show and try to keep them out of the clean clothes. it will all get done eventually. and hopefully i won’t forget anything! disclosure: i’m part of the disney junior mom program and i receive special perks as part of my affiliation with this group. although, disney junior isn’t actually *packing* my clothes or doing my laundry. that would really be a perk! at least they are helping keep the kids busy 😉 the opinions on this blog are my own. rebecca 3 min read april 19, 2012 7 replies how to celebrate earth day on april 22: go outside! parenting {this earth day post is brought to you by my friends at disney junior} earth day is approaching this sunday and i’ve written before about ideas on how to celebrate earth day with the kids, including some books to read. but this year i am going to recommend one way to celebrate earth day, and that is to get outside. to appreciate the earth our children need to appreciate nature. to enjoy it, play in it and realize how special it is. that we compost and recycle to protect the earth is such a vast concept for them, but tell them how picking up garbage off the ground protects the grass where they run, and the pond where they like to watch the ducks are far easier concepts to grasp. even in urban settings, there is nature around us – and if not, it’s time to go find it (or make it yourself in the backyard!) i love it when my kids get outside and play in the rocks, or the dirt, or roll around in the grass. when we find robin’s eggs and look at them closely or when the worms are crawling in the garden, these are all learning opportunities and chances for all of us to appreciate the beauty of nature. here are a few ways you can celebrate earth day by getting outside: 1 – scavenger hunt give older children a list, create bingo-type cards with pictures for young kids, or verbally tell kids what to look for. a leaf, a dandelion, a pine cone, there are many ideas. 2 – plant something add something special to your garden or a loved ones garden is a nice way to celebrate earth day. or, just get out and get the garden ready for planting when the nicer weather arrives. garden helper 3 – go for a walk seems simple enough, but sometimes a walk or a hike (like through gatineau park) is a perfect way to see nature in an accessible way. what’s happening in the forest right now? for other ideas, check out this post i just did about fun in the backyard. is it raining outside or looking for something else to do to talk to your kids about earth day? check out nayla natural care’s blog post with links and ideas. did you know disney junior has printables and activities you can do with the kids? check out their earth day page for ideas. i especially like this page of activities to do (most of which include getting outside!!) disclosure: i’m part of the disney junior mom program and i receive special perks as part of my affiliation with this group. the opinions on this blog are my own. rebecca 2 min read march 26, 2012 no reply so long winter (i hope) and continued adventures with disney junior parenting we had a real taste of spring (summer actually!) last week, and now we are in shock that it’s gotten so cold again! but as we are wrapping up the long, cold winter months, we are looking for new fun activities and adventures to do. we will continue our gymnastic classes one afternoon a week, the kids are really enjoying it, and while it was odd being indoors on a beautiful day last week, i suspect most of the spring won’t have perfect park weather each and every day. i am noticing that this year is maybe the first time both kids are really independent at the park – that is to say, i don’t have to help one of them up the slide steps, or stop them from throwing sand (too often). they play wonderfully together and being outside seems to widen their imaginations – suddenly they are ninjas, and playing house, and off on top secret adventures. it’s adorable. meanwhile, as part of my disney junior mom status, i get some fun sneak peeks at shows and get to share information with you. the second season of jake and the neverland pirates has begun, and we watched the special show with peter pan! it aired on march 23 (and has been repeated since). did you catch it? we watched it a couple of times now and thought it was fun. peter pan is a part of all of our child hoods i think? there’s some fun jake and the neverland pirates games on disneyjunior.ca too that the kids have been enjoying! meanwhile, we were beside ourselves with excitement at the tangled short that was on this weekend. it was sooo cute! while we are back to having our faces pressed on the windows hoping for a nice day to get outside and play, it’s great to have some quiet time too. what are you doing to shake off the winter icicles and enjoy the start of spring?
