a puppy is relentlessly scheming to destroy your life. i may or may not or maybe definitely have been using bandit as leverage when talking to marlo, she who would rather be digested by an eel than have to talk on the phone. if we’re facetiming she wants to do nothing but look at herself acting like a clown, and if we’re on the phone she’ll put it on speaker and walk away. i don’t take this personally—she does this with everyone—and if you’re sensitive she’ll make you feel like total garbage. do not call marlo if you want someone to tell you everything is going to be okay. she’ll yawn and tell you to go stick your face in a vacuum hose. but, a puppy moved in next door. and if there’s one thing on earth that kid loves more than anything, more than a poop emoji, even, it’s a goddamn baby dog. so when i call her i’ve been all, “hello—puppy. puppy puppy puppy puppy. puppy. how are you—puppy. what? i can’t hear you—puppy.” we made it to the four-minute mark once because i threatened to withhold the puppy if she didn’t answer a few basic questions: how are you? what did you do today? are you excited about tomorrow? can you fix me a hot dog? who is john galt? what a present she has to come home to. daily daily photo photos email articletwitterfacebookpin it australian shepherd,bandit,childhood,dog,puppies,puppy prev books people send me, installment four next the parisian perspective on everyday life 3 comments scott smith 2017/08/03 at 5:17 pm that sounds right. my daughter has a cat at her mom’s house and a dog at my and my wife’s house. the dog is a part of every conversation and a good way to get her to text me back. jonathan 2017/08/04 at 5:54 am love the tagline “america’s next top asshole” lol – nearly spat my coffee across the desk. not that i’m reading your blog at work, honest… l - mama(e) in translation 2017/08/04 at 9:36 am awww… please do let us know more about marlo’s reaction when she encounters bandit. isn’t coco going to die of jealousy, though? that should be interesting! 😉 but you are an experienced “dog person” (sorry, i’m a cat person) and should know what to do. oh, and i love using bandit as leverage when trying to get her to talk to you! heather b. armstrong hi. i’m heather b. armstrong, and this used to be called mommy blogging. but then they started calling it influencer marketing: hashtag ad, hashtag sponsored, hashtag you know you want me to slap your product on my kid and exploit her for millions and millions of dollars. that’s how this shit works. now? well… sit back, buckle up, and enjoy the ride. read more savesave related // getting the advil ready a kitty and her puppy we’re gonna catch a big one! a moment // related reads they only come out at night down dog herded! where there’s a twill shibari mini halo $27.95 anker usb-c 60w charger $54.99 luxe bidet neo 120 $59.95 soviet space graphics: cosmic visions from the ussr $39.33 about press faq contact terms of service privacy policy site by cooperhouse latest pin latest instagram a note (pun intended) and very important info foll copyright © hba media, inc. all rights reserved. dooce® is a participant in the amazon services llc associates program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com, and is also a rewardstyle, shopsense, and stitch fix affiliate.
