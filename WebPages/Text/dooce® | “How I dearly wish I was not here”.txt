shop about book posts podcast shop about the smell of my desperation has become a stench daily ‚Äúhow i dearly wish i was not here‚Äù by heather b. armstrong july 10, 2015 ‚Äúi personally believe that dogs are into quality vs. quantity of life, and he knows you‚Äôre hurting. and he wants to know if you‚Äôre going to be okay when he‚Äôs gone.‚Äù in 2008 i hired a trainer to work out some kinks with coco, and during some of our training sessions she got to spend some time with chuck, witness his unique personality, watch him slink off when bored with the conversation. once while traveling i paid her to board the dogs at her home, and when she returned them she handed over chuck‚Äôs leash, pointed at him and said, ‚Äúthat ain‚Äôt no dog.‚Äù i laughed open mouthed. how many people have met him and expressed something similar? there is no other dog quite so peculiar in an almost professorial way. i had a long talk with her a week ago, and the quote above is what she told me after i shared with her what i‚Äôm about to share with you. when i arrived home from dropping the girls off with their father in new york, i immediately noticed that chuck‚Äôs condition was getting progressively worse. exponentially, almost. he was waking up in his own feces every single morning. because of the way that he is shaped, his poop comes out of the hole for his tail in every diaper that i‚Äôve wrapped around his body. during the day he began pooping near the back door of the basement and smearing it around, sometimes with his face or head. he also stopped listening to or acknowledging any command i gave. he would not come when called. he refused to sit. he did not want to go for a walk. and then, oddly, he remained lying in the dog bed that is situated near the desk where i work. normally he prefers to be alone and will slink off to a dark hallway when i sit down at my computer, but last week he stayed put. he hung out all day sleeping, occasionally lifting his head to glance over at my furiously typing hands. late last thursday night after finishing up a project i sat down on the floor next to his fragile, curled up body. wait‚Ä¶ let me back up a few years. chuck hasn‚Äôt always preferred to be alone. in fact, when friends would come over he‚Äôd come find my body and wrap his own around it somehow. if i was sitting on the couch he‚Äôd force his way underneath my legs and poke his head out from between my knees to survey the crowd. if i was sitting on the floor he‚Äôd authoritatively plop his butt down on one of my crossed legs and press his body into mine so that i had to look around his head to see and talk to my guests. he preferred that i sit on the floor so that he could do this. he had a sense for it, a radar of sorts, where he‚Äôd be in some other part of the house and receive a vision that i was somewhere sitting on the floor. without fail he‚Äôd show up and have a seat in my lap. i‚Äôd rub his ears and say, ‚Äúfancy seeing you here.‚Äù chuck hasn‚Äôt tried to sit in my lap in almost four years. not once. there have been certain events that triggered chuck‚Äôs reclusive nature. yes, my divorce is prominent among them, but i can pinpoint several others that have sent him brooding into dark hallways. aging hasn‚Äôt been a joyride for him, either. when i sat down next to him last thursday evening he didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt blink, didn‚Äôt acknowledge that i was there. i reached over, cupped his head in my hands and lifted it toward my face. he didn‚Äôt jerk it away, but he did turn his head out of my hands to lay it back on the bed. i tried this again and achieved the same result. the third time i held the back of his ears a little more firmly so that i could catch his eyes. he finally didn‚Äôt turn away. i held his gaze with mine for a few seconds and said, ‚Äúhey, we need to talk.‚Äù he blinked but then continued to look me squarely in the eyes. ‚Äúyou need to tell me how you‚Äôre feeling,‚Äù i said looking back into the dark expanse of wisdom so deep that if you jumped in you‚Äôd never hit the bottom. we sat there staring at each other for over a minute, neither of us looking away. i remembered the first time i fumbled with his leash on the corner of stanley avenue in los angeles, the moment he realized that his neck wasn‚Äôt attached to my hand and the electric current that circulated through his entire body to set off the lightbulb above his head. i had to chase that impish puppy for three blocks as he darted in and out of alleys and hid behind manicured hedges. here i was searching for him again. he finally blinked one more time, and then he very painfully stretched out his body from the circle of where he‚Äôd been curled up. i set my hands on the floor on either side of me and sucked in an involuntary sharp breath as he stood up, took a few steps toward me and climbed into my lap. his dignity would have at some other point in his life preferred that i not talk about what happened next, but i know that he wants me to set that aside for now so that i can share this with all of you. chuck tried to sit down on my leg like he had so many times before, but he physically could not do so. his hind legs trembled as he attempted to set himself down. so i reached up, hugged him close to me and eased his butt onto my right thigh. i realized then that his diaper was wet, but that thought was pushed flat against a tiny corner of my brain as his words filled the whole of it like rising water. he pushed his torso against my chest, tucked his head up under my chin and rested it on my left shoulder. i gripped him with enough force to communicate that i was listening, that i could hear him pleading, but gently enough to honor all of his protruding bones. we remained in that embrace for over 30 minutes. i‚Äôm not sure i‚Äôve ever been given a gift so valuable. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:15 pm mountain time, the former congressman henry buck chucklesworth died peacefully in my arms. i had the privilege of catching his last breath on my knee. i then cradled my baby boy like i used to do 13 years ago while dozing on the couch looking out at a california sunset, the sky under which he was born. i know how much all of you loved him, and i reassured that marvelous, professorial dog in the hours leading up to those last moments that you, too, would be okay that he wanted to leave. daily email articletwitterfacebookpin it chuck,dog,portrait prev our retreat at runamuk next kaleidoscope 280 comments desiree fawn 2015/07/10 at 1:31 pm oh

site in years, but i‚Äôve been reading still all this time. i just cried like i cried at ‚Äòinside out‚Äô the other day, and for a dog i never met in person. a dog that is surely as much a person to you as your own kids, and a great one at that. we will miss you chuck. lauriewrites 2015/07/10 at 1:56 pm lord heather i am sorry. that dog was a marvelous gift to the world and the internet, but the

2015/07/10 at 1:56 pm i‚Äùm so so sorry. july 3, 2014, we said goodbye to our jake, he was 16, and he had been with our family for 14 years. we rescued him when he was 2, and he had some ‚Äúissues,‚Äù namely separation anxiety. once we figured we could keep him ‚Äúout‚Äù of places, but not confined ‚Äúin‚Äù a place, we all got along just fine. one thing i loved about us being with him, while we were saying goodbye, the 5 of us, sitting on the floor in the vets, was that the staff came in with a basket of fun-sized candy. we fed him the once forbidden reeses, snickers, and a hershey‚Äôs kiss or two. it was sad and peaceful when he went, but he was happy, and so ready, too. thank you for sharing chuck‚Äôs story with us all. msp68 2015/07/10 at 1:56 pm no words. just love. elizabeth cadorette 2015/07/10 at 1:58 pm i cannot thank you enough for sharing so much of this fantastic not-dog with all the rest of us, as you so graciously continue to share of yourself. i am so very very sorry you‚Äôve lost your friend, heather. sending love from our house to yours. suzy soro 2015/07/10 at 1:58 pm i‚Äôm so sorry, heather. i can‚Äôt help but crying when the paragraph starts ‚Äúat 3:15 pm‚Äù because dogs are as close to god as we get. rip chuck. you were a very good dog. lori 2015/07/10 at 1:58 pm this has to be the most beautiful tribute i‚Äôve ever read about the love and trust that is shared between a dog and his best friend. the poetry in your words speaks volumes of the poetry of your relationship. he had a beautiful life and what sounds like a beautiful passing in the arms of his true love. if only we could all be so lucky. i‚Äôm so sorry to hear of chuck‚Äôs passing. i‚Äôve followed your blog for almost a decade and the posts and photos about chuck were always my favorites. rest peacefully, sweet little man. the world was a batter place with you in it. nancy b. 2015/07/10 at 1:59 pm you were lucky to have each other. thank you for sharing him with us all these years. my thoughts are with you. melissa kuehl dix 2015/07/10 at 1:59 pm i am so, so sorry. crying here (at my desk) in wi too. i had a similar conversation with my dog of 17 years, bailey, just
