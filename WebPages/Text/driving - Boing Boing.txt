"prudent" drivers take the middle path. they drive past the first available space, betting on the availability of at least one other space further in. when they find the closest space between cars, they take it. if no spaces exist between the furthest parked car and the entrance, prudent drivers backtrack to the space a meek driver would have claimed straightaway. so which strategy is best? as the name suggests, the prudent strategy. overall, it costs drivers the least amount of time, followed closely by the optimistic strategy. the meek strategy was "risibly inefficient," to quote the paper, as the many spaces it left empty created a lengthy walk to the entrance. read the rest share / tweet / 36 comments cars / driving / math / mathematics / maths / modeling / parking / simulations david pescovitz / 6:26 am wed, jul 3, 2019 police: no, a corpse doesn't count toward the hov lane passenger minimum on monday, nevada highway patrol trooper travis smaka pulled over a minivan in the high-occupancy vehicle (hov) lane because nobody else was visible inside except for the driver. turns out, the driver works for a funeral home and was transporting a body. from the reno gazette journal: "he immediately tells me he's got the remains of a person in the vehicle behind him, so i kind of glanced in the back and confirmed that,” smaka said of what he saw in the cargo area – a bodybag strapped to a gurney. “it kind of threw me off a little bit, and then he just made the funny remark, something along the lines of, 'so he won't count?'.." nevada's hov rules do not clarify whether an occupant must be breathing and leans on federal law, which is not much clearer.... an official with the federal highway administration said it is up to individual states to define what an occupant is – and referred the usa today network to the nevada department of transportation for additional information. “when you talk about high occupancy vehicle lanes, you’re talking about seats – so a person would need to occupy a seat to qualify,” said nevada highway patrol trooper jason buratczuk. “this person was obviously a decedent and in the cargo area of the car, so they would not qualify for the hov lane.” the officer let the driver off with a warning. image: sounderbruce/cc by-sa 4.0 read the rest share / tweet / 27 comments cars / driving / hov / laws / roads david pescovitz / 11:16 am fri, feb 15, 2019 watch a bus do a u-turn on a busy highway according to digg, this bus driver in china realized he wouldn't make it through a toll plaza so he pulled a u-ey. i think he actually wanted to grab a killer parking spot on the other side of the road. read the rest share / tweet / 23 comments buses / driving / freeways / highways / traffic seamus bellamy / 5:37 am tue, jan 1, 2019 florida driver caught by cops for using james bond-style license plate a driver from orange county florida was dinged by the cops for using a very slick-looking device to obscure his license plate while using a toll road. it would have been the perfect crime, except for one thing: when the driver worked his license plate magic, he failed to notice that there was a police car rolling right up on his back bumper. read the rest share / tweet / 33 comments #floridaman / driving / license plate readers / the police / toll roads seamus bellamy / 4:27 am fri, nov 23, 2018 all-wheel drive and four-wheel drive explained winter's here and, like clockwork, everyone's started driving like idiots. if you recently bought a vehicle with part-time four wheel drive, four wheel drive, all wheel drive or anything else in between, this might be a good time to brush up on what your ride's good for and what you should avoid. look no further than this video. unless you really want to. if so, you'd do well to spend some time reading this story by jalopnik. read the rest share / tweet / 52 comments all wheel drive / cars / driving / four wheel drive / trucks / winter driving / winter weather mark frauenfelder / 12:24 pm wed, oct 31, 2018 what it's like to drive in japan i'm pretty used to driving on the left side of the road, having driven in rarotonga, new zealand, and australia for several months. but i would be nervous to drive in japan, because the roads are narrow and i am nervous i wouldn't be able to read the signs. but this video makes me think i should rent a car the next time i go there. this video tells you about international driving permits, speed limits, rest stops, car rental, tolls, and other tips. video: youtube read the rest share / tweet / 17 comments driving / japan jason weisberger / 10:37 am fri, sep 28, 2018 stubby multi-bit screw and nut driver fits in tight spaces this stubby screwdriver fits into tight spaces. read the rest share / tweet / 19 comments drivers / driving / handy tools / screwing / small but cool tools / tool / tools david pescovitz / 7:22 am thu, aug 23, 2018 funny and clever anti-drunk driving sign as a wise man once said, "it's funny cause it's true."
