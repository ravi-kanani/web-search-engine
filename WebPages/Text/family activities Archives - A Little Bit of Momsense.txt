watch audience members disappear from their own driver’s licenses!…brace yourself for a whole new take on magic when you step into vitaly’s world. on the shenkman arts centre website, you can watch a video clip from vitaly’s performance on a penn and teller show last year (where he fooled them) – that had everyone’s jaw dropping! honestly, i watched the clip and every time i thought i knew what was happening or why it was happening, i was completely wrong. each step of the trick had me scratching my head. that’s a great sign of a successful performance – we don’t want to know how it’s done, but can’t stop ourselves from thinking about it! the upcoming show is recommended for kids aged 7 and over and tickets are still available! find your tickets on the shenkman arts centre website. shenkman arts centre is a blog advertiser. rebecca 3 min read july 22, 2017 no reply what to do with kids in august in ottawa around ottawa there is still plenty of summer left before the kids all go back to school! not sure how to keep them busy if you are around ottawa this summer? here are some activities that you may want to check out (i’ve included ones that will be perfect for older kids and ones for younger toddlers and preschoolers too!) what to do in #ottawa with the kids in august via @bitofmomsense click to tweet fun family activities to do in ottawa this august explore the canadian history hall the history hall has been something we’ve been looking forward to, and it’s on our august list to visit. with so many canadian artifacts and so much information in one spot, it’s sure to be an interesting visit. learn about vimy at the canadian war museum my son has been asking to go to this for a while, so if you have older kids or ones interested in military history, the limited vimy – beyond the battle exhibit (it’s here until november) will be of interest to you. this is also on our august list! take in the fun programming at billings estate national historic site this was brought to my attention by my sister who has three little ones under the age of five. she raved about the special programming at the billings estate national estate site (a place we love to go too!). i didn’t realize they had so much to offer during the summer. there are programs for preschools as well as kids up to age 12. different days of the week offer a different theme. check it out! learn about farming at the cumberland heritage village museum another local museum that we love is the cumberland museum. on august 13, they have a special farming event where families can learn more about farm life, and get hands-on with experiments and more. go back in time at upper canada village we love visiting upper canada village, and the summer is always a great time to walk around the village and explore. plus, buy bread. before you go: print off the two free children’s tickets that ontario has available! visit petrie island i recently wrote an article on savvymom about all the fun activities at petrie island. it’s been a rough year for the island, and some activities may have changed depending on how the location is doing, but it’s worth looking into the junior naturalists program so kids can learn more about the creatures and plants living there! walk through mosaicanada i keep talking about this event, but it’s for good reason. if you haven’t been, it’s worth checking out. it’s free and stunning. attend the navan fair i love a rural fair. probably because i grew up where every summer you couldn’t wait to attend the fair. i also love deep fried mini donuts. the navan fair is august 10-13! check out the ottawa busker festival i always find it fun when we are able to see art, acting, music and more on the streets, up close and out in the open. the ottawa busker fest is sure to have the kids in awe as they watch! it’s on sparks street from august 3-7! happy august! rebecca 2 min read december 15, 2016 no reply family workshops at ncac and nvac parenting the nepean creative arts centre and nepean visual arts centre welcome families for art adventures we had such an amazing time at a recent nepean visual arts centre family craft workshop. it was a holiday workshop that took about 2 hours and included hot chocolate, cookies and family bonding time! you may have seen my picture of our super cute reindeers that we all did from instagram. what i loved about the workshop was not only the cost ($66 for the entire family!) but also that it was real quality time together. no other commitments, no phones, no dishes in the sink staring at us – it was our family (surrounded by other families!) getting creative. each of our personalities came out in the results and they now are proudly displayed in our living room. the family that crafts together 😍😜 🎄 a photo posted by rebecca s (@bitofmomsense) on nov 26, 2016 at 1:00pm pst it was not only agreed that we would absolutely do another workshop next year, but we’ve already recruited my sister and her family who want in on the crafting action as well! the nepean creative arts centre and nepean visual arts centre offer classes, workshops and programming for kids, families and adults all year round. in 2017, they have more offerings that everyone will enjoy! a few that have caught my eye: canvas and cocktails (i wrote about my experience in a previous blog post), the clay wheel workshop and i think a lot of kids will love the acting workshop! for a full list of upcoming dates, visit their website. tip: experiences like this make wonderful holiday gifts! make memories – give the gift of art this holiday season with an arts centre gift card when you are faced with the task of choosing a gift for someone you love, it can be daunting. look no further than a gift card that they can spend at the nepean visual arts centre and the nepean creative arts centre. whether your special someone is a painter, potter, dancer, singer (the list goes on), there is a class for everyone!
