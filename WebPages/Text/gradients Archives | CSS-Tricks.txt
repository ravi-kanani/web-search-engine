pic.twitter.com/mvpdajxt1w ‚Äî dan mall (@danmall) december 3, 2018 my first thought process was: the lines are padded, and that's tricky enough to pull off. box-decoration-break is probably our friend here. but it turns out we need a litttttle extra trickery to make it happen.‚Ä¶ read article ‚Äúmulti-line inline gradient‚Äù box-decoration-break gradients mix-blend-mode article december 28, 2018 gradient borders in css author chris coyier 15 comments go to comments let's say you need a gradient border around an element. my mind goes like this: there is no simple obvious css api for this. i'll just make a wrapper element with a linear-gradient background, then an inner element will block out most of that background, except a thin line of padding around it. perhaps like this‚Ä¶ read article ‚Äúgradient borders in css‚Äù border border-image gradients link july 13, 2018 scrolling gradient shared by chris coyier if you want a gradient that changes as you scroll down a very long page, you can create a gradient with a bunch of color stops, apply it to the body and it will do just that. but, what if you don't want a perfectly vertical gradient?
