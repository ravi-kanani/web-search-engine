(except christmas cards. they cause me stress every year!) i recently wrote an article on ottawa family living about family traditions and how i may hold them a little too tightly at times, ways that we can introduce or review our traditions each year, and why they are so special to me. hop over to read it on their site. what are some of your favourite holiday traditions?

this holiday season, if you are looking for an edible gift to give someone you love, here‚Äôs a list of a few items i would love to see under the tree. instead of filling our homes with more stuff, i love the idea of giving something that can be consumed, shared and enjoyed by many. take a bite out of your holiday shopping list with these food gift giving ideas! cardamom and cloves based in ottawa, this is a subscription service that will mail the lucky gift recipient a selection of three spices each month that can be used in your their own kitchen creations or to experiment with the recipes provided. for $9 or less a month, this is a spectacular gift. top shelf preserves i bought a selection of top shelf preserves for my hard-to-buy for dad last year and they were a hit. i love the variety of pickled options (i will eat anything if it‚Äôs pickled i think!) and their chutneys will be a welcome addition to any holiday spread. prince edward island preserve company every year when we are on the island we eat here and shop at the preserve company. it‚Äôs amazing and delicious. their jams are heavenly, the lemon curd almost sinful and the tea is a staple in this house. purdys chocolate i want the salted caramel chocolates, let‚Äôs just put that out there. i got a couple boxes last year and i can never have too much. there is a huge selection online and a flat rate for shipping. you can get a lot of shopping done with just a few clicks. but i recommend wrapping everything right away so you don‚Äôt tempt yourself! wine club subscriptions i‚Äôm counting wine as food. we are currently in a wine club with ravine winery and it‚Äôs amazing. it‚Äôs absolutely an indulgence for us but each month, two bottles of amazing wine shows up to our door along with an item from their pantry. every so often their smoky almonds are in the box and we have to fight over who eats the last one. there are two subscriptions with ravine (one has limited membership) but both offer discounts at the winery and delivery of wine to your door. another local niagara winery to check out for their club is chateau des charmes. their adventurer level wine club delivers two bottles of wine each month as well, one from the lcbo and one that you can only get at the winery. we love the grounds at chateau des charmes and this is a great way to introduce the wine lover on your list to more delicious ontario wine. chocolat favoris fondues since writing about chocolat favoris this summer, our love for it has not waned. i recently bought the advent calendar to enjoy! they have a lot of gift giving options online or in the store, but gifting their fondues would be a fun, unique gift. they have some packaged up in festive boxes, or paired with their chocolates in gift baskets to make your gift giving even easier! festive coffee i will never turn away coffee as a gift, especially this time of year when we are entertaining so often. i love the festive winter harvest blend from ten thousand villages each year. it‚Äôs available ground or as beans. no matter what gifts you decide to get, it‚Äôs always the thought that counts (as long as you don‚Äôt think about eating the gift ahead of time, you‚Äôll be fine! üòâ rebecca 5 min read november 23, 2015 2 replies holiday gift guide: great gifts for kids 2015 parenting, shopping it‚Äôs time for my holiday gift guide! what items will be under my tree, have been under the tree and we love, that just look really fun etc. i try to find items that aren‚Äôt maybe as common as you‚Äôd find by browsing through the flyers that are delivered to your door. and yes, shopkins are making an appearance in our house but i didn‚Äôt add them to the list. also not on the list but is always found under the tree are books! hopefully this will help you find a few new, fun, useful items for your kids or the kids in your life! click here for last year‚Äôs list (because many of those items are still being played with around here) and the lists of previous years. you‚Äôll notice my list tends to grow with my kids, but i try to include a variety of ages! need help finding something?

chocolate toffee skor bars ingredients: (crust) 3/4 cup butter 3/4 cup brown sugar, packed 1 1/2 cups flour (middle/topping) 1 can sweetened condensed milk 2 tbsp butter 1 package milk chocolate chips 1 package skor bits directions: mix together butter, sugar and flour. this will make a cookie crumble mixture. press firmly into buttered (or parchment lined) 9√ó13 pan. the parchment will make it easier to remove from the pan and to cut. bake at 350 degrees f for 20-25 minutes. meanwhile, warm the condensed milk and butter in a sauce pan until blended. when the crust comes out of the oven, use a paper towel and tea towel and gently press the crust down (don‚Äôt burn yourself!). this extra firmness while it cools will make it less likely to fall apart later. pour the condensed milk/butter evenly over cookie base after it comes out of the oven. bake for about 12 ‚Äì 15 minutes longer. sprinkle the chocolate chips over the fresh-from-the-oven pan. bake for 2-3 minutes. evenly spread the chocolate over the top. add skor bits on top. gently press so they stick to the chocolate. let cool fully before serving. enjoy! and yes, they freeze well! other holiday recipes to try: the best ginger molasses cookies melt in your mouth shortbread homemade peanut butter cups unbaked cookies (mud pies) 50% off our favourite coffee brands (ends oct 13) facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube grab a coffee and join me! welcome to a little bit of momsense! my name is rebecca and i'm chatting about parenting, family friendly activities, yummy recipes, family travel, and living a life full of love and laughter. thanks for stopping by! fabulous advertisers, friends and affiliates for content tips and support ‚Äì subscribe! use code momsense10 to save 20% this error message is only visible to wordpress admins error: the account for needs to be reconnected. due to recent instagram platform changes this instagram account needs to be reconnected in order to continue updating. reconnect on plugin settings page visit rebecca's profile on pinterest. tags activities activities with kids activity around ottawa baseball birthdays blogging centrepointe theatres children christmas disney junior family family activities family time family travel food gift guide giveaway halloween holidays home kids kraft canada learning march break mothers day netflix ottawa ottawa events parenting pei pinterest play preschool activity recipe recipes school shopping sobeys summer tag along toys terra20 thanksgiving theatre travel archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 missed a post?
