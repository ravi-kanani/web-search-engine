the new kliin dish cleansing paste saves water and will last about 6 months. simply wipe some on your cloth and wash. it doesn’t hurt that the lime smells great too! what i was also impressed with was that it is really a great cleaner! i had to scrub something that i thought was going to be way trickier than it ended up being and this paste really helped! to get more information about kliin, find them online at www.kliin.co instagram: @kliinco facebook: @kliinco enter to win interested in winning your own kliin set with the dish paste and reusable cloths?

food, home, kitchen tips what do you consider essential to your backyard? we are constantly trying to improve our little back yard. i’ve written about it numerous times before. my sister has a small yard, and yet her treed lot that provides her natural shade, her gorgeous cedar fence and her keen eye for cute decor makes it feel so inviting. i aspire to set our yard up like that, and yet we always run into a few issues. we like to entertain back there, but the space itself is primarily for us. the kids play in the sprinkler, or colour with chalk, and andy and i like to sit and chat with our coffee or a summer drink. there are certain elements in the yard, no matter how big or small, that are important to us: shade, a comfortable place to sit, and a bbq. the latter is something i don’t have! i’ll get to that in a bit. shade is paramount and yet in our backyard it’s been one of the hardest elements to ensure we have. we toyed with the idea of a giant umbrella, but anchoring it was an issue. we did settle on a portable, folding shade canopy that is easy to put up and down, but isn’t permanent. after many years, one of our trees is finally big enough that it provides us with glorious, needed shade. our yard is all sun in the late afternoon and early evening, so the tree is in the perfect location. i go back and forth about furniture all the time. i want a living room style set up, and yet the price tends to keep me away. we do have two folding chair loungers that are very comfortable (and have a drink holder) but when we have company, we would like to have a few more spots that offer the same comfort as our living room. perhaps one of the most important items that we don’t currently have in our backyard is a bbq. we got one as a gift from my parents when we were married and it lasted a number of years, but three years ago, it died and we didn’t replace it. at first, we thought we didn’t need to replace it. but now, years later, we are finding ourselves browsing online for a small bbq to put on the deck to help relieve the pressures of summer cooking. mostly, when i am looking at bbq recipes, i start to lament not having one. check out the bbq recipes on ricardo’s cuisine, a canadian resource for yummy food. my mouth waters when i look at these recipes and i think about how it would be fantastic to whip them up myself. when i get a new bbq, what recipe will i go to first? i am thinking a nice side dish, like this corn and avocado salsa, or a traditional baked potato with a twist. or maybe i should go directly for the main course and make this white fish and chorizo or spiced chicken dish that i think even the kids would love! now i’m hungry. i don’t think i can really go wrong, do you? this summer, i am finally dedicated to replacing our bbq, and plan to extend the bbq season into the fall. what do you think? is a bbq a must-have essential for your cooking? disclosure:this is a sponsored post however, all opinions are my own. and yes, i need to get a new bbq. especially after having browsed through all of these recipes that i’m missing out on making! rebecca 1 min read april 13, 2015 no reply at home: living room shelves lifestyle remember ages ago when we were looking into buying shelves for our living room from ikea? then we bought the shelves and felt great because of a sale, then waited to put them up (for possibly no good reason), then couldn’t get doors because they discounted our shelves? good times. anyway, the shelves are up. they have been for months. and i love them. even door-less, they are already finishing off that room nicely. it’s an open concept with the kitchen and dining room, but we always need extra storage. these shelves have turned out not only to be wonderful looking but also handy. we feature some of our favourite books, our favourite pictures, items and more on the shelves. we have the kids most-used arts and crafts available, bins for pencils and sharpeners (a must for homework) and shelves with family board games and activities. they still need some work. a few bins to help keep the clutter down, but i am happy with them. there’s always more to be done at home, isn’t there? i think my next project is to set up a bit of a privacy screen on my deck with garden boxes this year. we love using our back yard, i loved growing things last year, and i want to continue that, but we are rather close to our neighbours. a little extra privacy might be just what i need. something like this maybe?

i have boxes of note cards, piles of notebooks with pretty covers and many clips in different colours. and yet, drawn like an insect to light, i keep looking. both of these books were gifts. my friends know me well. i know i’m not alone. i’ve spoken with many people that are the same. what is it about the hard-covered, pinterest inspired notebook that inspires me? i use many of them, jotting ideas or work notes. i rarely use them as a journal and often wonder if that’s what i should be doing. meeting notes don’t have longevity, so is that a poor use of a gorgeous art-inspired book? my notecards are rarely used, at least, with less frequency than i aspire. i want to write more. mail things more. have to buy a stamp. maybe by writing this publicly i’ll hold myself accountable. pretty stationery shouldn’t sit in a drawer. it should be used. i love that my notebooks, paper and clips instill some element of loveliness into each day. no matter how attached i am to my smartphone or computer, i can’t help but go back to my notebooks with an easy gliding pen. that can’t be beat. instagram is covered with images of clean desks in a brightly, naturally lit room, with gold clips and black note books. i love those images. i really do. they may be indulgent but i can’t get enough. although, we all know that’s not how my desk really looks. i do dream about that one day. today i found these library cards. i think they are meant for scrapbooking, but impulsively, i found myself at the checkout counter buying them. should i use them in someway for books on our family room shelves? i haven’t decided. but the classic look and feel made me excited with possibilities. are you obsessed with stationery? and what should i do with my new library cards? rebecca 0 min read january 27, 2012 no reply friday favourites: pinterest round up parenting here’s a round up of some of my favourite pins from pinterest this week. enjoy! source: amy-newnostalgia.blogspot.com via rebecca on pinterest source: tumblr.com via rebecca on pinterest source: lifeinpleasantville.com via rebecca on pinterest source: meredithheron.com via rebecca on pinterest source: mixmingleglow.com via rebecca on pinterest facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube grab a coffee and join me! welcome to a little bit of momsense! my name is rebecca and i'm chatting about parenting, family friendly activities, yummy recipes, family travel, and living a life full of love and laughter. thanks for stopping by! fabulous advertisers, friends and affiliates for content tips and support – subscribe! use code momsense10 to save 20% this error message is only visible to wordpress admins error: the account for needs to be reconnected. due to recent instagram platform changes this instagram account needs to be reconnected in order to continue updating. reconnect on plugin settings page visit rebecca's profile on pinterest. tags activities activities with kids activity around ottawa baseball birthdays blogging centrepointe theatres children christmas disney junior family family activities family time family travel food gift guide giveaway halloween holidays home kids kraft canada learning march break mothers day netflix ottawa ottawa events parenting pei pinterest play preschool activity recipe recipes school shopping sobeys summer tag along toys terra20 thanksgiving theatre travel archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 missed a post?
