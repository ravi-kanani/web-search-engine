give it a go and let me know how it works for you. i have searched high and low for examples. i’ve tried to find one that will work for our family, but i just couldn’t find anything. i wanted a schedule that: gave our family structure without gave our family some room to move allowed the kids some choice and options allowed me to work (since i work from home!) put these kids to work a bit (because a family of 5 home for a million days means this house will be a mess. . . ) so i think this homeschooling during coronavirus schedule is what will work for us. i have included several versions of this schedule for you, in case you wanted to modify: school at home during coronavirus: totally blank school at home during coronavirus: blank times school at home during coronavirus: blank descriptions school at home during coronavirus: times with everything else blank school at home during coronavirus: our family’s schedule i’ll be sending out more as the week goes on, but until then, please send over any ideas, suggestions, or questions to me. we’re all in this together! other coronavirus related posts: want some more help, support, and resources during the coronavirus closures?
