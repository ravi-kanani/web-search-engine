(not like squid dogs of yesteryear, which was another flop; this was a real, i’m gonna go into my room and cry hysterically kinda flop.) friends, this is not easy. but i’m sure i don’t need to tell you that. believe me. even our day 1 didn’t look the way i imagined it would. it was . . . not pretty. and i’ll be honest: kids yelled, and i yelled. . . kids cried, and i cried. let me set the stage: i shared the idea of school at home on saturday with the kids. and then i plotted and planned all day sunday, thinking of great ideas and resources and so. much. fun was going to happen! and then i woke up early monday morning and printed out my schedules. i set up the kitchen in a special way, allowing for several different desk options. if kids wanted to use the standing desk that i use for work, they could! if they wanted to work at the dining room table, they could! if they wanted to work at the art table, they could! i even put a teeny little old school desk that i got at an estate sale out as a joke. so. much. choice. right? hmph. i wanted the day to be a certain way, but the kids were envisioning a completely different thing. so you know what? i bagged everything. i threw my hands up, and i said, fine. you got it. today is yours. do whatever you want. no limits on electronics. call whatever friends you want. sit in front of the tv. facetime, snapchat, tiktok to your heart’s content. play video games all day. all i ask is that you keep track of what you do. i want to see it how you decide to use the day. and i went to the dining room table, i sat down, and i cried. and then i sat on the phone with apple for a million hours—3 1/2 hours!—while i tried to work out a problem with maddy’s phone. it was a crap-ola day. totally and completely junky. i doubt anyone kept track of anything they did, but whatever. i don’t even care. the plus is that each child apologized to me separately. each one said sorry. and i did, too, because i really think my anxiety and my need to control scary, new situations felt like smothering and being trapped to my kids. so my husband and i sat down individually with each child on monday night after the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day, and we talked about what happened. i told them how i felt, and we figured out how we can make this schedule work for them, individually. the talks went well. really. but guess what? tuesday was a blank slate. i let them do what they wanted. it was st. paddy’s day, and each person had a friend over, and those friends stayed for corned beef and cabbage. it was a good day. wednesday was a blank slate. we went for a long family hike, almost five miles. the sun was shining, the birds were singing, and we explored some back paths only minutes from our home. we came home tired, ate frozen pizza for lunch, and relaxed for the rest of the day. cora went to bed early, and maddy, owen, my husband, and i watched boyz in the hood. not the best choice for us right now. we didn’t finish it. note to self: go for a little lighter movies right now while the world around you is in chaos. overall, though, it was a good day. thursday was a blank slate. we didn’t do anything. we organized some things, did some other things (who even knows what we did–and why can’t i even remember?!), and we did . . . who even knows what. it was a good day. friday was a blank slate. we didn’t do anything. my husband went into his school and helped to distribute over 300 meals to his students and their families. maddy made her world-famous chocolate chip cookies. we put up cora’s new led lights in her room. we ordered food from our favorite italian restaurant for dinner. it was a good day. so what will next week look like? i really can’t tell you. i am just focusing on giving myself–and my family–a little time to breathe right now. i’m focusing on allowing us all to mourn for the loss of the life we once knew. the sudden end to cheer teams and soccer. the end of clubs, youth group, bible study. the end of busy afternoons and carpools and homework and late showers and way-too-early alarms. stuff we complained about but now that it’s gone, we really miss. i’m focusing on allowing us to mourn the cancellation of maddy’s sweet 16 party which we’ve been planning for months. to mourn the loss of cora’s 13th birthday celebration. to mourn the loss of our first-ever family vacation to the dominican republic in april. with the help of a lot of prayer and many deep breaths, i’m instead focusing on giving us all a little grace over here. we need some grace if we forget chores, if we forget to shower, if we forget to change our clothes for a few days. some grace to eat what we want, when we want, and to exercise if and when we’re up for it. we need grace to make our bed–or not–and to play family games–or not. grace to make an ice-cream sundae at one in the afternoon and leave the bowl in the living room. grace to laugh so hard one minute and to cry the next. grace to find this break from school exciting and fun and uncomfortable and scary at the same time. as a family, we’re focusing doing a bit more take-out and a lot more screen time than normal. we’re trying to get outside for fresh air every day. we’re going to go through some closets, finish some house projects, and start some puzzles. we’re going to watch movies, play games, and spend some time by ourselves, too, alone in our rooms or out back or in the book nook. we’re going to focus on the garden, on giving, and on figuring out fun ways of connecting with friends and neighbors. i’m going to eat maddy’s amazing cookies for breakfast and not feel guilty. i’m going to call friends and read books. and i’m going to let my kids slowly wrap their heads around this. i’m going to let them figure out, for themselves, how to best navigate this new territory, because i really think that that’s the best kind of homeschooling we can do for them right now. friends, please tell me how this week went for you. this is hard, but i know we can do it, amy ps. are we following each other on instagram? can you tag me (@teachmama1) on something cute or funny? i could use a lift. ——— related posts free hand washing posters: coronavirus 2020 we may have three 'big kids' in our house, but we all still need reminders… click to learn more homeschooling schedule during coronavirus school closings here is our official homeschooling schedule during the current coronavirus school closings. school at home.… click to learn more say something week: prevent violence or suicide in your child's school say something week: prevent violence or suicide in your child's school | tools and resources… click to learn more preparing for kindergarten--the last week many of my good pals and awesome readers have emailed me asking what exactly i'm… click to learn more comments comments 03 | 20 | 2020 comments leia says march 21, 2020 at 3:39 pm mourning is exactly how i am feeling! i don’t even know everything i’m mourning yet but it feels like a lot of loss. my kids are a little younger, 10 and 7, and we don’t do a lot of activities so i’m not sure it has hit them yet. they are just having fun with all the free online activities. reply amy mascott says march 22, 2020 at 1:31 pm i think we’d be crazy if we weren’t mourning just a little, right? this is a big loss–for all of us–in so many different ways. reply amanda says march 21, 2020 at 6:09 pm we did well for schoolwork here, but i don’t focus on it as a “scheduled” school time. it has to happen sometime but not at a certain time. i have this quarters spelling words from the teacher, so we go over the spelling like we normally do and then we’re done with it. i’ll give a small “test” at the end of the week. and we’ve been reviewing multiplication tables, because that isn’t a strong skill yet, and i want it to be. we’ve done the easier ones in groups and well focus on the more difficult ones one at a time. i have found worksheets online that i’ve printed to go over (usually only 1 or 2 at a time), then that’s it. we don’t focus our entire day on school and we work it into our normal day (like usual, but with more emphasis now) like playing board games, etc. it works for us so far. reply amy mascott says march 22, 2020 at 1:31 pm go, girl!! amanda, it sounds like you’re rocking it, friend. way. to. go. please please let’s stay in touch. we can do this! reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website our books & freebies email sign-up: success! now quickly head over and check your email to confirm your subscription. you don't want to miss this! there was an error submitting your subscription. please try again. email address subscribe archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 search this site tags 0-2 years 3-5 years 6-8 years 9-12 years alphabet behavior books cooking cool & creative counting crafts creative kids critical thinking digital literacy early literacy elementary schoolers family fun family life family time fine motor skills food games giveaway giving back gratitude holidays homework time indoor learning listening math middle schoolers new for us friday outdoor learning parenting preschoolers printables read-aloud learning reading school science speaking sponsored post summer fun vlogs writing instagram recent pins more pins you tube check out our channel! about contact disclaimer terms of use privacy policy site-map copyright © 2020 · teach mama media, llc · designed by smitten blog designs · privacy policy · log in
