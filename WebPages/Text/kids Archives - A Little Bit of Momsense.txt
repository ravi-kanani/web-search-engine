15, 2018 no reply and now, you’re 12 as they grow today you turned 12 years old. you, our little boy, who is growing into a young person we are so incredibly proud of. but you seem to straddle two different worlds; childhood and what’s next. it’s not quite adulthood, i can’t bring myself to say that, but it’s that much closer. you still hold my hand with one of your own, and yet reach for your independence with the other. don’t think i haven’t noticed how much bigger your hand feels in mine. but perhaps your growth only matches how my heart has grown in the 12 years since becoming your mom. i have to let go of the hand eventually, but i can tell you aren’t ready; not yet, not fully. so i hold on to the one you offer me, when you offer it. but you keep taking those small steps into what’s next. i know you still need us. as we need your to carry your love and laughter and curiosity into our family as you always have. and your sister needs you to guide her, gently, and to love her as you always have. now that you are older, i think you see that even more too. we want you to be yourself, with your interests like music and baseball and history and games. because when you are yourself you shine. i’m going to hold onto that hand every time you offer it. i hope you keep offering it for a little while longer. maybe even when you don’t need it, i will. today we celebrate you, happily and with enthusiasm. because you deserve it. you are 12. you are amazing. and you are loved. rebecca 1 min read february 16, 2018 no reply and then she was 9 as they grow, parenting this weekend, we celebrate my daughter’s ninth birthday. it’s a weekend event, between family parties and friends and today being a pd day (and her actual birthday) and i hope these celebrations help her feel as special as she really is to us. i wrote a post when my son turned 9, about his excitement, and how much fun it is to live that through his eyes. it’s no different with her, but there is just a bit more of an emotional feeling with her turning 9 because she’s our baby. our last. the last 9th birthday we celebrate. there’s always something bittersweet about these occasions with her because of that finality in being our second and last child. but we love watching her grow. she’s a confident and kind person and we couldn’t be more proud. she teaches us so many lessons about patience and happiness all the time and there are so many aspects to her personality that i want to absorb because i wish i was more like her in so many ways. i couldn’t be prouder of who she is becoming and the light that she brings into this world. i hope her next year and all the others ahead are as joyful for her as these many years have been for me, and that she continues to dream and shine. happy birthday baby girl. xo rebecca 2 min read february 12, 2018 no reply how your kids can have a creative march break around ottawa march break camps at the nepean creative arts centre and nepean visual arts centre march break camp options for creative kids in #ottawa via @bitofmomsense click to tweet march break in the ottawa area is quickly approaching, and if you are struggling with booking a camp for the kids, it may be time to check out the nepean creative arts centre and the nepean visual arts centre. having a creative outlet for their week of march break might be the perfect way for the kids to try something new, express themselves and connect with new friends. below i’ve listed a few sessions that i think would appeal to kids of different ages (they are for kids aged 6-11, depending on the course). at the time of writing this, i selected classes that still had space left (some other sessions that looked really great are already full, so if you miss out for march break, remember that there will be summer camps offered too!) i love that each one is a bit different but still creative. hands-on art programming, dance, and theatre (including musical theatre!) might be just what your child hoped to do during their break. some camps are four days, others are for the entire five-day week. drawing, painting and sculpture – kids aged 6-9 “explore your imagination through scultpure, drawing and painting. let your creativity flow as you use different techniques and materials to learn advanced methods and explore new skills.” want to register? click here. urban dance camp, for kids aged 6-9 “this unique style of dance incorporates hip-hop, breakdancing, pop’n lock, and freestyle. master the dance moves from each style in a fun and energetic class.” want to register? click here. theatre camp, for kids aged 7-11 “camp meets arts collective. expand your dramatic skills by exploring character development, voice, movement and performance techniques – while giving theatrical expression to your ideas. performance on the last day in the theatre.” want to register? click here. musical theatre camp, kids aged 7-11 (note – this is a four day camp) “from act one to curtain call! learn vocal techniques, singing, choreography, acting, and a broadway-style song and dance.” want to register? click here. nepean creative arts centre is a blog advertiser. all opinions are my own. rebecca 2 min read february 6, 2018 1 reply apps that kids love (and parents don’t hate) entertainment sure, we let our kids have screen time. when they ask to use the ipad to play games, it’s easy to get lost in the see of app options that are available. even if we think we are being wise by only downloading free games, there are in-game payments that make those free version obsolete rather quickly. and if we are investing in an app that is $2.99 or $3.99, we want to make sure we are not just dumping our money away. here are some apps that we find are kid-friendly, favourites, and don’t want to send us into a frenzy of app deletion. toca boca games my daughter loves these games, and while i’ve been lucky enough to have received some of the apps for free to try out through the blog, we have almost always bought the new ones when they come out. she likes the little characters and how interactive you can be in the games. there’s a large element of creativity and we like that. she loves toca life pets, and toca hair salon to name a few. 2. sago mini games another series of games that include cutesie characters are the sago mini games. there is a little red bird that my kids always love to see in the games. sago mini farm or world always has something new to explore. 3. minecraft this is probably old news, and if you are like us, there’s a good chance you already have minecraft on at least one platform (yes, i said at least one. we have it everywhere). while i personally am terrible at this game, i don’t mind it for the kids at all. i love that they each can use the game in their own way (my son likes the adventure/exploring side of of the game, while my daughter loves to design and create her buildings, manage her animals and create her world.) i like how creative the game encourages kids to be. beware though: while i have this game listed as one i don’t mind as a parent, you should know that if kids play together it sometimes doesn’t end well. if one sets fire to the other kids’ house or lava gets dumped on the garden, it’s pure mayhem. 4. garageband this is one that not only can the kids get into, but parents can love too. garageband is a recording studio on your phone or tablet. there are music loops, and instruments (guitars, drums and more) for the kids to experiment with. music is such a wonderful way for the kids to use a tablet. do you have any of these apps? rebecca 5 min read march 30, 2017 2 replies your babies grow up but they still need you as they grow, parenting parents, if you have newborns or toddlers, everything feels beyond overwhelming. trust me. i know. because i’ve been there. there seems to be an endless need for something – attention, physical contact, learning – it’s all part of what we signed on for as parents. however, the difficult moments, when they are yelling at the top of their lungs or lying on the ground refusing to move out the front door, seem like they will never end. i’m here to tell you that they do, and i also want you to know that it changes. now, as my children are 8 and 10, we’ve entered a new stage of parenting. every age and stage has brought moments of pure joy and happiness, as every stage also brings stress, guilt and fear (this age is no different), but our pre-teen, post-preschool age that we are in right now is proving pretty amazing. they are beyond easy to travel with, they are able to communicate (most of the time) what they need, when they are hungry, or if something is bothering them. they are fun people to play with and be around! now, this post isn’t one to tell you to slow things down, and appreciate each toddler tantrum or baby wake up in the middle of the night because it’s fleeting. if you are a parent, you already know that a) time becomes something you can’t control at all and it accelerates to a new warp speed you didn’t realize was possible and b) simultaneously, some days feel like they will never, ever end and you will forever be trapped in the most uncomfortable rocking chair with a child pinching your nipple while the toddler demands answers about why their crackers are upside down suddenly. you know about time. you don’t need a lecture about enjoying the moments because while those tough times are there, for every age, you also know how your heart might burst from your chest at any moment, or that you get teary eyed at the silliest things your kids do. i know you know this. if you want to hear that there is something beyond the toddler tantrums, i will happily reassure you that there is (um, i’ll just gloss over how i think age 4 is the toughest ever, okay?) set aside the need and desire for time to slow down or for the tough moments to pass quicker. this post is to tell you that even as my kids gain more independence, even as i grow prouder and happier with the people they are becoming each and every day, even as they pour their own cereal before bed and complete their morning school routine without any intervention from me, i’m here to tell you they will still need you. and that’s what i want you to think about in the tough moments with the newborns and toddlers. because the thought of them not needing us can be far too overwhelming. last night my 8 year old crawled into the bed with me. i didn’t even wake. and in the morning, after i allowed us to sleep in as late as we possibly could she snuggled in tighter and wanted just a few more moments in my arms. she’s perfectly able to get out of the bed and get ready for school herself, but in those early morning moments, she just needed me. my 10 year old has more freedom to make decisions on his own now and is given space and opportunity to do so. but he’s still the one giving me a hug when he says goodbye in the school yard. he still wants to chat about our recent adventure and spend time recapping every moment while planning for the next. he still needs me. those are the moments we will remember as parents. in every stage, even as they grow and their need for us changes on a daily basis, but i’ve also come to realize that just like us, they want an extra long hug sometimes. i know they do. they will push away in their own subtle ways while they are growing but they still need us. those moments, the tough ones, feel long. they do even now when we deal with random angry outbursts or hurt feelings or the usual parental disciplinary decisions that are ‘completely unfair’ and that ‘ruin their lives’ somehow. but that doesn’t change how we all feel about each other. they still need us. they probably always will in some way or another, we just need to be there for them. and really, when we are in those rocking chairs in the middle of the night with a newborn on us, that’s the same message and need as it is now. we’ll always be there. i really want them to know that. your babies will grow but will they’ll still need you via @bitofmomsense click to tweet rebecca 1 min read january 27, 2017 no reply toddler speak as they grow, parenting do your kids have special ways of saying certain words? even as my kids have gotten older, there are still a few sayings of theirs that remain unique, like they have their own language. especially when they are speaking to each other. when the kids were first learning how to talk, and were toddlers, they had certain ways of saying words. here are a few: lone = phone mummin = muffin ot = off hat = have i wrote those down so that i wouldn’t forget. at the time, i told myself there was no way to forget their cute words. now, i know there were so many others! some words, like earmuffins (for ear muffs) still make me laugh. those are the memories that sometimes fade; the little mannerisms of the sweet voiced toddler. they have long been replaced with a confident, older voice that my older kids now have. but those wee voices still remain in the back of my mind, yet, they seem a bit foggy now. has it really been that long since i’ve had a toddler? (the answer is yes, my youngest turns 8 soon!) looking back on those toddler years, these unique words, that are cute and sweet, are cherished memories. does your child have a special way of saying something? my recommendation is to write it down so you don’t forget! facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube grab a coffee and join me! welcome to a little bit of momsense! my name is rebecca and i'm chatting about parenting, family friendly activities, yummy recipes, family travel, and living a life full of love and laughter. thanks for stopping by! fabulous advertisers, friends and affiliates for content tips and support – subscribe! use code momsense10 to save 20% this error message is only visible to wordpress admins error: the account for needs to be reconnected. due to recent instagram platform changes this instagram account needs to be reconnected in order to continue updating. reconnect on plugin settings page visit rebecca's profile on pinterest. tags activities activities with kids activity around ottawa baseball birthdays blogging centrepointe theatres children christmas disney junior family family activities family time family travel food gift guide giveaway halloween holidays home kids kraft canada learning march break mothers day netflix ottawa ottawa events parenting pei pinterest play preschool activity recipe recipes school shopping sobeys summer tag along toys terra20 thanksgiving theatre travel archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 missed a post? making a greener difference with these easy changes (plus enter to win!) activity: make and design a hotel! activities for kids: subjective art a fun scavenger hunt game for the kids (with printable!) playing with cardboard – don’t recycle those boxes yet! get-moving activity: movement stations for kids 8 carry-on items to travel with: what i bring to travel family travel: hotel tips for travelling with children walt disney world planning tips: family travel ottawa giveaway: enter to win 4 tickets at meridian theatres facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube we use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website for personalization, advertising and to analyze usage. by using this site, you agree to this.continuewant more info? read our privacy policy.
