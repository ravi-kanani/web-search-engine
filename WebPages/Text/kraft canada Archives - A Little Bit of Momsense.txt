we are already super busy, we donâ€™t need the added stress of baking complicated recipes added to our lists. try this instead! head over to the kraft canada website for the full recipe. recipe testing: cream cheese squares via @bitofmomsense click to tweet disclosure: i am a member of the kraft canada whatâ€™s cooking contributor group and receive compensation for my post. opinions are my own. rebecca 3 min read october 28, 2017 no reply your next pasta dish to keep in the fridge for a tasty meal food, recipes usually when i use peanut butter, i make a dessert. or, in this house, it gets used up just by eating it plain. my kids have taken to eating pb and pretzels as an after school snack. but i love peanut butter in a savoury dish. combine that with my desire to have easy meals ready to go and itâ€™s not a surprise that this peanut thai noodle salad was a huge winner in my books. try this pasta salad with peanut butter the next time you need a potluck dish! via @bitofmomsense @kraftcanada click to tweet itâ€™s no secret that while i love cooking, my love for being in the kitchen and creating something new and tasty has to be on my own time. during the week, when we are rushed as a family and i canâ€™t decide what to make that is nutritious and fast, it feels more like pressure and takes the joy out of it. when i have time, itâ€™s a wonderful way to spend part of a day. when i donâ€™t, it feels like a chore. i think thatâ€™s why i love having easy, go-to recipes that i can use any time during the week with limited ingredients. itâ€™s definitely one reason i have turned to kraft canada recipes for years and years. i can alter them to suit my tastes, and to use what i already have in the pantry or fridge. this peanut thai noodle salad is a cold pasta salad (i love pasta salads!) and was the perfect weeknight no-meat dish. i think next time i make it, i will keep it in the fridge for a tasty lunch for myself during the week. i used bow tie noodles because i love them but a tighter, more firm noodle (like the original recipe calls for) would hold its shape and sauce better. i also omitted the snap peas just because i didnâ€™t have any â€“ thatâ€™s the beauty of these recipes, i can easily change them up. the sweet red peppers were a perfect foil to the saltiness of the soy sauce and because i used kraft all natural crunchy peanut butter, the only added sugar was from the honey. i probably could have reduced the amount of soy sauce just a bit and still had the flavours i wanted with each bite. i think what i loved most about this dish was how easy it was to make. i canâ€™t wait to make it again. for more kraft canada peanut butter recipes visit their website!

i say usually, because there are certain kinds she ends up liking, like the hersheyâ€™s chocolate pudding cups that we were sent in partnership with kraft canada. i think thereâ€™s something about pudding that reminds me of my childhood. or maybe itâ€™s just because iâ€™m a fan of dessert in general. sometimes, however, itâ€™s nice to put a twist on a traditional favourite. how about turning chocolate pudding into a banana split? slice some strawberries and add a bit of sugar to let the juices come out. slice up bananas and grab a pudding cup (bonus: you wonâ€™t need the whole pudding cup for the banana split so you have to eat the rest!) you can score your own hersheyâ€™s pudding cups to eat as is or make into a banana split in the refrigerated section of your grocery store plus there is a coupon!

the other thing i love about this dish is that you can make it for more than two people (and for those asking, no, my kids didnâ€™t want anything to do with it. they donâ€™t love white fish unless itâ€™s in a stick format ðŸ˜‰ it doesnâ€™t take long to make, and as i mentioned for a weeknight meal it was perfect. andy and i instantly looked at each other and agreed to make this a part of our meal rotation. do you love cooking with fish like we do? this is one to try any time of the week!

#whatscooking recipes iâ€™ll admit something that may be shocking to some of you â€“ cheesecake isnâ€™t my first choice for dessert usually. my husband loves it, but i donâ€™t always appreciate cheesecake the same way he does. however, there are some exceptions. anything that has a sauce usually catches my attention, and frankly, a traditional cherry cheesecake is hard to beat as well. a good cheesecake is good cheesecake, you know what i mean? and when i find cheesecake recipes that are delicious? i am eager to bookmark them for the future. for example, how about a dulce de leche cheesecake? sign. me. up. hereâ€™s what i loved about this recipe: it was easy to make, i can cheat if i want (by buying pre-made dulce de leche), it can be made ahead, and it makes enough to serve many people â€“ making it the perfect dessert when entertaining. for many of us this time of year, we are cooking and baking to feed many guests, family from out of town and friends who stop by for a visit. having this in the fridge this week has been really handy when i wanted to share something sweet with people! dulce de leche cheesecake? yes please! @kraftcanada #whatscooking recipe on @bitofmomsense click to tweet click here for the full recipe. a tip: i had to heat the condensed milk longer than the recipe called for to get it more golden brown. i probably could have gone even longer to get a butterscotch or deeper brown colour and typical dulce de leche colouring. or, like the recipe says, i could just buy a jar. with so many friends and family arriving throughout the holidays, keeping up with the menu can get overwhelming. if you are looking for a dessert that can be set in the fridge and forgotten about until you serve it, this is the one for you. itâ€™s delicious, even if iâ€™m not the biggest cheesecake fan, this is the type of recipe that would turn me into one. happy holidays! disclosure: i am a member of the kraft canada whatâ€™s cooking contributor program and receive compensation for my post. all opinions are my own. the recipe truly was delicious and has been a hit! rebecca 1 min read november 22, 2016 no reply recipe: peanut butter oatmeal chocolate chunk cookies #whatscooking recipes itâ€™s safe to say that many of us know and love that chocolate and peanut butter are a natural combination. iâ€™ve shared my recipe for homemade chocolate peanut butter cups before and you can click here to find more peanut butter and chocolate recipes from kraft canada. this month, as part of my kraft canada whatâ€™s cooking recipe review, i tried their peanut butter oatmeal chocolate chunk cookies. they were a hit with this family! (i think andy loved them the most!) i used the kraft all natural chunky peanut butter, which ended up being a really tasty decision. there is no sugar added to their all natural chunky pb and the recipe has plenty of sugar already so i didnâ€™t miss that extra sweetness to the cookie. i also used chocolate chips, although chopping up my bakers semi-sweet chocolate like the recipe suggested would have worked just fine! both andy and i agree we like chunky peanut butter better than smooth. the kids donâ€™t see eye-to-eye on this, but we loved the peanuts in our pb! these cookies havenâ€™t lasted long these week. while i canâ€™t send them to school as a snack, theyâ€™ve been a great after school treat for the kids. thanks to the oatmeal and the two different sugars, i loved the texture of these cookies. they had a little bit of crispness and a little softness in the middle, which for me signifies a perfect cookie. the only thing they couldnâ€™t do? clean the mess i left afterwards! disclosure: this post is part of the kraftheinz canada whatâ€™s cooking program for which i am a contributor. all opinions are my own. i really do like chunky peanut butter better than smooth ðŸ˜‰ rebecca 1 min read may 19, 2016 1 reply easy dip for a quick snack or entertaining: kraft canada food and drink, recipes you know those recipes that are so easy you arenâ€™t sure if you can actually call it a recipe? thatâ€™s sort of how i feel about sharing this kraft canada layered dip recipe made with new philly cheddar. but, i am happy to share it because oh my goodness itâ€™s delicious! i altered the recipe only slightly, removing the refried beans, but that didnâ€™t mean the layered dip wasnâ€™t just as tasty. this combination for me is lunch in a cup. it has everything i love â€“ guacamole, salsa, cheese â€“ and salty nacho chips. the new philly cheddar can be used in a lot of different ways, i originally had planned to cook with it when i first got it, but the layered dip is the perfect flavour combination and perfect vehicle for it (although my husband enjoyed simply spreading it on a bagel!) the layered dip can be made for one (hello lonely work-from-home lunch hours) or for a crowd simply by making many cups or just using a larger casserole dish. to make my easy guacamole, i mashed up an avocado, squeezed in half a lime and finely chopped part of a small shallot. i could have skipped the shallot part and it would have been tasty too! want to try it yourself?

the celebration of cheese sounds pretty fun around here. fun for my taste buds! iâ€™m one of those drooling-over-cheese kind of people. and by no means am i really adventurous (my husband will try any kind of cheese no matter how stinky or odd), but thereâ€™s rarely a time when a recipe that involves cheese is a miss for me. kraft canada and loblaws are celebrating cheese with cheesefest from march 19 until april 9. this is the perfect time to pick up cheese at your local loblaws store for your next meal, snack or dessert! cheese is constantly in the fridge at our house. the kids each like it in a variety of ways and typically not the same way â€“ melted on a grilled cheese sandwich, sliced into thin slices for eating as is, cream cheese spread on bagels â€“ the options go on and on. i love cooking with it. cheese is very forgiving. i find itâ€™s difficult to really mess up a cheese recipe, and when in doubt, itâ€™s perfectly acceptable to serve cheese as is! i can use cream cheese for dessert recipes or when cooking supper, and shredded cheese melts into a gooey, delicious bite. if you have been reading my blog for a while, you know i love to share cheese recipes thanks to my partnership with kraft canada. i try to focus on family friendly recipes that focus on taste first. here are three ways to use cheese in your kitchen! traditional mac and cheese this recipe still reminds me of my childhood. itâ€™s simple, and sometimes simple is best. i feel like this is one of those recipes that will be passed on to my kids, and their kids and so on. simply lasagna my mother-in-law shared this kraft canada recipe with me years ago and i havenâ€™t made another one yet (even when i make a simple meatless lasagna, i still follow these instructions). the recipe had me from the moment i didnâ€™t have to pre-cook the noodles. the secret is to let the lasagna rest for a good chunk of time to really firm up. each slice is gorgeous after that. this is a go-to when serving large groups too and it freezes well! charcuterie board okay, so may itâ€™s less of a recipe and more of a type of meal, but never underestimate the power of a delicious bite of cheese with the right chutney and crisp cracker. go with an old cheese to ensure the sharpness which contrasts sweet jellies or fruit chutneys. #dinner a photo posted by rebecca s (@bitofmomsense) on jan 10, 2015 at 1:20pm pst you want to eat cheese now, right?
