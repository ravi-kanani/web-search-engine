how many eggs have orange? how many have yellow? how many eggs have zig zags? how many have polka dots? how many have stripes? find two eggs that match. why are they the same (repeat this since there are a few) how many eggs are there all together? next, using a cup or piece of paper, have the kids go to a spot where they canâ€™t see the eggs (or have them shut their eyes) and cover up one egg. have them return to the paper and ask them to describe which egg you covered. youâ€™ll be surprised how many times they remember! mix up the activity however you like. enjoy! rebecca 1 min read october 4, 2011 3 replies activity: cutting and counting ghosts activities and crafts learning skills: counting, using scissors, french hereâ€™s an easy activity to do with all ages. for my toddler, i did the cutting (she tried a bit) while she did the gluing. for my almost 5 year old, he did the cutting (which is also why there are fewer ghosts â€“ cutting is not his favourite thing!) and i helped him with his writing. i had my son count in french (actually, that was his idea) but being super smart, i thought iâ€™d write out his numbers too. then realized later that i spelled the number â€˜oneâ€™ in french wrong (itâ€™s not une itâ€™s un). so, andy and i have decided andy will take more of a lead on the french (ha!) enjoy!! 1- give each child a piece of construction paper (my daughter insisted on pink instead of halloween orange!) 2-for younger children, cut out the ghosts for them. for older children, have them cut the ghosts. 3-glue the ghosts anywhere on the page. 4-using sticky backed foam (or felt, or black markers) add the eyes on the ghosts. 5-count (in any language!) the number of ghosts you have. (but be sure you are teaching your children the correct spelling of words! ðŸ˜‰ to go along with this activity, we also have the best halloween counting book â€“ this is a favourite each year! rebecca 1 min read september 5, 2011 1 reply preschool at home: little sis wants to go to school too activities and crafts on wednesday i kiss my big nearly 5 year old boy goodbye and send him back to school. itâ€™s only 2.5 hours a day, and heâ€™s looking forward to it so itâ€™s a very different feeling i have about it than i had last year. meanwhile, his little sister is still at home. sheâ€™ll be three in february and the idea of sending her to preschool this year did cross our minds. but then she would be in preschool for two years before even starting regular school. we thought it was a bit much (and selfishly, we wanted to keep her at home a while longer!). but as i did with her brother, we will be doing some fun preschool activities at home. learning numbers and the alphabet, crafts, seasons, and reading. doing these short burst of â€˜circle timeâ€™ activities was something her brother really enjoyed â€“ and helped me fill the day. i know she will enjoy it just as much. iâ€™ll be blogging some of the fun stuff we come up with, but in the meantime, iâ€™ve added a new page (see top header bar) to keep the activities in one place for easy reference. not sure what to do today? maybe you can find something you want to make! preschool activity page enjoy facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube grab a coffee and join me! welcome to a little bit of momsense! my name is rebecca and i'm chatting about parenting, family friendly activities, yummy recipes, family travel, and living a life full of love and laughter. thanks for stopping by! fabulous advertisers, friends and affiliates for content tips and support â€“ subscribe! use code momsense10 to save 20% this error message is only visible to wordpress admins error: the account for needs to be reconnected. due to recent instagram platform changes this instagram account needs to be reconnected in order to continue updating. reconnect on plugin settings page visit rebecca's profile on pinterest. tags activities activities with kids activity around ottawa baseball birthdays blogging centrepointe theatres children christmas disney junior family family activities family time family travel food gift guide giveaway halloween holidays home kids kraft canada learning march break mothers day netflix ottawa ottawa events parenting pei pinterest play preschool activity recipe recipes school shopping sobeys summer tag along toys terra20 thanksgiving theatre travel archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 missed a post?
