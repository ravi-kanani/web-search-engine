do they’ll help your family really make this lent count? click the image below or the ‘buy now’ button and grab these lent cards for thoughtful christian families. i’d love to have you try them and let me know what you think! do share what you’re doing this lent to really make it count. follow us on instagram at @teachmama1 and use the #prayfastserve hashtag for your own family’s practices. want a few more ideas for the easter season?
