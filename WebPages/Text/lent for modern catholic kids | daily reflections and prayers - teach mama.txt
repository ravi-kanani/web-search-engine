(believe me–i’m by no means an expert on lent; if you want to learn more, definitely visit the resources at the end of this post.) but what i wanted this year was something similar to what i was reading in matthew kelly’s rediscover jesus— something that would help our family to have our ‘best lent ever’. so i created daily cards with a lenten spin. you know we love our daily cards. lunchbox notes, daily grammar, daily writing. you name it. i like consistency. anyway, i created simple prompts based on traci smith’s 2016 lenten practices for families calendar (which you can buy for $2). i liked the way that traci based her activities on the three traditional ‘pillars’ of lent–prayer, fasting, and almsgiving (or service). i had never looked at lent in this way, so i thought it might be worth doing for our family. any way that we, as parents, can break down something big and complicated like lent into something smaller and more manageable, the better. right? right. so really, that’s it. i found a tiny wooden easel that cora got at a birthday party last month, and i created cards that would easily rest on it. i didn’t want all of the cards to be on the easel; rather, i wanted just a few–3-5 cards–so that if someone missed one by chance, it would be easy to catch up. there are eight pages of lenten reflection cards and a final page with the 5-finger prayer method and a prayer for pope francis. we used the pope francis prayer handout at our children’s liturgy of the word last year. i think it’s helpful for kids. and that’s it. do you want these cards? do they’ll help your family really make this lent count? i’d love to have you try them and let me know what you think! do share what you’re doing this lent to really make it count. follow us on instagram at @teachmama1 and use the #prayfastserve hashtag for your own family’s practices. want a few more ideas for the easter season?
