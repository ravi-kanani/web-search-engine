add some trains, dog loss, and truck breakdowns and you have one good country tune. comment by reavolution — may 3, 2007 @ 6:42 pm aww, how sweet. my eyes are leaking.. comment by oxo — may 3, 2007 @ 6:46 pm absolute genius, my kids love it and have picked up the tune ever so quickly and are singing an adpated version at the tops of their voices! when does the album come out! :) comment by andy — may 3, 2007 @ 6:52 pm a bit of real yorkshire accent at the end, too! comment by claire — may 3, 2007 @ 6:52 pm ahhhh bless!!! très adorable! i heard a slight dolly parton yodel in there…i’m impressed! comment by princesse ecossaise — may 3, 2007 @ 7:30 pm did she say, “i did dribble on my mummy”? if so, that’s my favorite part! comment by alumna — may 3, 2007 @ 7:39 pm …because it’s funny how that stands out in her mind, of course. :) comment by alumna — may 3, 2007 @ 7:39 pm indeed. because she did “dribble” copious amounts of blood on mummy. comment by petite — may 3, 2007 @ 7:56 pm well done tadpole! she sang that with confidence. comment by jean-luc picard — may 3, 2007 @ 7:56 pm oh she’s such a sweetie and such a cutie! comment by trevor — may 3, 2007 @ 8:06 pm hilarious. each part of the horrifying story is told – the fall, the blood – and the dribbles on mummy, the cleaning up and hospital visits – all with an appropriately sad melody and voice raised to the heavens for dramatic emphasis. sounds like the quiet little mouse curled up on your lap on the plane is feeling much better now. i’m glad. comment by peg — may 3, 2007 @ 8:11 pm i love the way she says it “did blood”! are you from the north of england by any chance?! comment by beta mum — may 3, 2007 @ 9:47 pm i’d say you either have a new alanis (old school) or maybe avril on your hands. dark subject matter – but with a peppy beat! comment by jelly — may 3, 2007 @ 9:58 pm cool. to be bi-lingual in belleville-ise and yorkshire – ese at the tender age of three! comment by h — may 3, 2007 @ 10:12 pm “and we did cleeeeeeeeeean…” gold. comment by inspiredbycoffee — may 3, 2007 @ 10:52 pm my cat, sam, seems to be very intrigued by the singing. she’s perched atop my lap and very intrigued as to the source of the music. comment by biblioninja — may 3, 2007 @ 11:03 pm “i did dribble on my mummy” that’s the best line without a doubt comment by mia — may 4, 2007 @ 12:02 am a singing blog, no less. could start a trend? comment by aussiegil — may 4, 2007 @ 12:18 am ahahaha! we (my daughter natasha almost 4) and i were laughing our heads off at this! needless to say, natasha does the same thing… cute! comment by karma — may 4, 2007 @ 1:14 am that is absoultely precious! too cute… comment by danielle — may 4, 2007 @ 1:25 am from the sound of it, nothin’ (not even a split lip) is going to interfere with her singing career! comment by la cubana gringa — may 4, 2007 @ 2:33 am i’m betting tadpole is going to be some sort of entertainment performer… comment by mlle smith — may 4, 2007 @ 2:52 am impressive ballad. tadpole has her mother’s talent for story-telling. comment by xl — may 4, 2007 @ 3:19 am well… for whatever reason she wanted sing about blood at least she was singing about cleaning it up as well. lol. comment by meritt — may 4, 2007 @ 3:59 am that’s the cutest thing! and she’s got a good voice for a kid =) she doesn’t sound too traumatized, fortunately! comment by robyn — may 4, 2007 @ 4:08 am booked to sing back-up on my next opus!! comment by rhino75 — may 4, 2007 @ 6:17 am she had me at, “i did dribble on my mummy!” really cute! comment by valkyrie — may 4, 2007 @ 6:20 am i’m very impressed, especially by “dribble”. my kids don’t know that word… though they’ve not dribbled blood in the past few years fortunately… la nouvelle star 2020? comment by magillicuddy — may 4, 2007 @ 8:27 am oh yes, and let me second that cat effect… mine too is rubbing up against the speaker… hmmmmm… comment by magillicuddy — may 4, 2007 @ 8:31 am so funny! and slightly gruesome. comment by jennifer — may 4, 2007 @ 8:47 am excellent!!! love me some tadpole singing! comment by sam — may 4, 2007 @ 9:16 am i love all of the dids in that song. what construction is that, linguistically? it’s so adorable. “and it did blood”, and “i did dribble” and “and we did it clean it up when it did blood”… i remember that’s how tadpole spoke when petite posted about the hospital incident. i guess that’s how she expresses the past tense in english! i loooove it. petite, does she do anything similarly inventive in french? comment by suzanne — may 4, 2007 @ 9:31 am that is possibly the cutest thing i’ve ever heard. release it and it’ll out-sell the arctic monkeys in online sales quicker than you can say ‘i did dribble…’ sx comment by soph — may 4, 2007 @ 9:33 am am v. jealous of how english she sounds. when mine speak english, parts of it come out with a foreign accent, not exactly french, just not naturally english sounding. comment by mancunian lass — may 4, 2007 @ 10:14 am in my best simon cowell voice- “massive awwwwww factor with dark undertones. a combination that has not yet been seen…interesting :-)” comment by ollie — may 4, 2007 @ 10:29 am kids are amazing… she made up her own hospital song! (i heard “fall down” and “we did clean [something something] blood” and something about sticking something on her lip. and the dribbling blood on mummy (!) very creative and healthy way of coping with her recent boo-boo. that’s one talented tadpole you’ve got there! comment by the bold soul — may 4, 2007 @ 10:34 am what a cute lesson in bilingual kids’ over compensating of the past tense… i did hurt me and it did blood… i love the way bilingual kids speak. so cute and a fascinating insight into language learning! comment by amanda — may 4, 2007 @ 10:50 am lol, shes a little comedienne. i love her accent! comment by maxi — may 4, 2007 @ 11:03 am i think – and parents of “normal” english kids can perhaps chime in here – that all kids go through a dodgy past tense phase. first she used to say “i goed”, now it’s “i did go”, although if i correct her, she’ll say “went” in her next sentence, so i’m having to repeat a lot of stuff at the moment to nudge her towards forming proper past tenses. but yes, the french creeps in “we did go in the hospital to talk at each other”. comment by petite — may 4, 2007 @ 11:15 am aaaah i have to wait till my boss leaves at the end of the day till i can listen to it- i’m very excited! comment by eliza — may 4, 2007 @ 11:39 am i must concur with other commenters – it’s the line “i did dribble on my mummy” that’s going to win this ditty a grammy. comment by sarah — may 4, 2007 @ 12:07 pm rest assured – “i goed” is a recognised stage in language acquisition in all kids – bilingual or not! comment by cath — may 4, 2007 @ 12:45 pm i reckon she can compete with ‘gyre and gimbling in borogroves’ any day. another writer/lyricist in the making. comment by sablonneuse — may 4, 2007 @ 2:22 pm “i did dribble.” “did blood?” are you sure you she hasn’t been exposed to frank zappa at some point? comment by dave of the lake — may 4, 2007 @ 4:35 pm yey! boss left- i turned my speakers up and i did laugh a lot and i did did think it was funny! comment by eliza — may 4, 2007 @ 5:35 pm i want to do this song about that i hurt me. ok i did hurt me, and it did do some blood, i did dribble on my mummy first i did get the handle from the ree, and i did run, and i did fall down a “mesjomalou” and it did make me blood, and me did clean it when it did do blood. if i forgany to the hospital, it did stick maman s’amenait oui, de cousine, ne vais hospital to talk at the each other. (?) comment by penny in amsterdam — may 4, 2007 @ 6:41 pm that’s great! i bet bob dylan could mimic this exactly comment by creative-type dad — may 4, 2007 @ 6:43 pm i seem to remember some dusty english language acquisition lessons and that kids have to go through hypercorrection “i did go” before settling on irregular verbs. grrr, leather elbowpads away now. your daughter is clearly a budding country star. all she needs to add to the song now is the rain and some kind of divorce…! gorgeous! comment by paris lights — may 4, 2007 @ 6:58 pm what a pity thet have to grow up comment by tillylil — may 4, 2007 @ 7:34 pm love the yorkshire accent! as for the english grammar, don’t sweat it, afaik it’s perfectly normal. my little tadpole is turning every french verb into a regular -er verb at the moment because he hasn’t learnt the irregular verbs (“maman, il faut prender le lait…”). he’s less forthcoming in english, but surprisingly often more grammatically correct than in french. go figure. it’ll all come out in the wash :-) comment by claire — may 4, 2007 @ 8:02 pm i got to know you from tf1 new ,well down ! cafee meng comment by cafeemeng — may 4, 2007 @ 8:47 pm a paris comme un etranger , la vie n’est jamais facile ! bon courage ! cafee meng comment by cafeemeng — may 4, 2007 @ 8:51 pm just spent the last five hours driving on various motorways – but now there is a big smile on my face! i’ve missed tadpole’s songs the last few weeks but she is back with a classic! comment by nigel — may 4, 2007 @ 10:08 pm absolutely brilliant… metaphysical poetry meets neo-punk. people up and down the country are singing this song (well, my daughter is, anyway). “i did hurt me” is positively john donne… and “i did dribble on my mummy” is just fabulous. but, more seriously — what a clever, healthy way for her to work through what must have been quite a nasty shock… comment by kitikat — may 5, 2007 @ 9:32 am j’adore ce que vous faites!!!!bravo comment by océane — may 5, 2007 @ 11:34 am genius! at least her song has normal subject matter whereas my big one’s compositions are rather more evangelical … generally about god’s love for everyone – ‘and he even loves you too moo’! and if she sings about mary and joseph and the baby jesus and the bumpy road to bethleham one more time … six blinkin’ months of non-stop nativity – even the high street isn’t that bad! comment by prawn cocktail crisps — may 5, 2007 @ 1:32 pm hilarious! that put a huge smile on my face! thanks! comment by kat — may 5, 2007 @ 2:42 pm petite: about the “i goed” thing: it’s actually more advanced than some think. obviously, kids notice that *most* past tense in english adds an ‘-ed’ ending. so, that overgeneralize, and, at certain stages of their language development, they assign every verb an ‘-ed’ ending. it’s quite fascinating actually. (i’m a linguist…can you tell? =) ) enjoy those moments! she sounds like such a doll. comment by kat — may 5, 2007 @ 2:45 pm she sounds so cute! how wonderful that she’ll grow up speaking at least two languages. the others will come very easily. it’s like when you are sporty, you can play many sports to a certain degree. i am not sporty. just glutton for languages…;o) comment by cream — may 5, 2007 @ 7:39 pm wonderful! i think she’s more concerned about the effect it had on you. and i hope that she’s still singing those songs when she’s 21 – which is perfectly normal! d. comment by despina — may 6, 2007 @ 3:48 pm awwhhh!! comment by sally lomax — may 8, 2007 @ 10:48 am that was very adorable. i agree about the grammy winning line! comment by nrg — may 8, 2007 @ 3:36 pm works very well as a ring tone …. very cute. comment by mark — may 8, 2007 @ 5:22 pm rss feed for comments on this post. sorry, the comment form is closed at this time. search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
