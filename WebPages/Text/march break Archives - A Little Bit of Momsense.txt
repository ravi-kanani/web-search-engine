now they can thanks to the diefenbunker, canada’s cold war museum. have you been to the diefenbunker in ottawa’s west end? we went a couple of years ago with my son and his friend and they loved the historic nature of it all. it was fascinating to be in the bunker and get a real sense of what life would have been like when it was built. i couldn’t help but think about classic movies and shows like james bond and get smart. that might be one reason why i love the thought of spy camp! this popular camp is running again this march break and you can register your child (or children, aged 7-12) for the entire week (march 13-17) or just for one day at a time. each day during march break there is a new theme associated with the camp. campers will learn all the skills they need to become master spies. there seems to be a problem with an agent x, so their help will be enlisted over the course of the week to thwart agent x. here’s a breakdown of each of the themes. for the full descriptions, visit the diefenbunker website! monday, march 13: the art of espionage tuesday, march 14: making and breaking codes wednesday, march 15: master of disguise thursday, march 16: investigation: hunt for the mole friday, march 17: the science behind spying things to know: the diefenbunker is located in carp. the camp days run from 9:30 until 3:30 but before and after care is available from 8:30-9:30 am and 3:30-4:30 pm. kids bring their own lunch and two snacks (nut free) each session is limited to only 15 kids. the ratio is 1 councilor for every 5 kids. the camp is delivered in english but all counselors can answer questions in french. the cost for the entire week is $235 per child. for each day (if only registering for a day at a time) is $55 per child.

other camps that sounds amazing (that i think my kids would be drawn to) would be the theatre camp or the animation camp, just to name a few. i love the thought of camps that are creative and will provide some new inspiration to kids across the city. fashion design, musical theatre, drawing, becoming a zombie 101 and more camp offerings are a unique way to spend the week. you can register for march break camp online if there is availability. camps are available for kids aged 6-17 so there’s something for almost all of your school aged children. full day camps are from 9 am until 4 pm but offer an early drop off (8 am) and a late pick up (5 pm). disclosure: ncac is a blog advertiser. all opinions are my own. rebecca 2 min read march 9, 2016 no reply march break in ottawa: 2016 around ottawa march break in ottawa: activities for the entire family first of all, if this weather sticks for march break in ottawa next week, we are going to have a melty, warm and sunny week. won’t that be nice? if you are wondering what to do with the kids for march break in ottawa, here are a few suggestions! 1- tag along toys once again, tag along toys (one of my fabulous blog advertisers!) is hosting craft activities for two hours each day in their kanata store all week long. i have done this during march break with the kids before and it’s a fun way for the kids to create (and for me to get some ideas for easter shopping!) visit the facebook page to find out the times for each day and what craft will be created! every day is something new. 2- visit the farm we love the agriculture and food museum this time of year. maybe it’s because spring on the farm is something special, but with the mild temperatures, i think it would be the perfect time to go and walk around. it may be muddy in areas, but it’s still a great way to spend time outside. be sure to take in some of their seminars like the maple syrup demo! 3-visit the sugar bush yes, this is one of my favourite things to do. i love going to the sugar bush. you can visit a nearby location in ottawa (proulx farm has a lot of activities for the family) or drive a bit out of the city. here’s the one we like to go to. no matter what the case, it will be a sweet day! 4- aviation museum workshops last year, my son spent time at a workshop about minecraft at the canada aviation and space museum. it was a hit! this year, they are hosting tinkering workshops each day. registration is required, but even if you don’t get into the workshop, i always love visiting the museum just for fun! for more ideas, i shared some in this savvymom article! wondering about camps? check out nepean creative arts centre (a blog advertiser!), shenkman arts centre or tumblers gymnastics, just to name a few, to see if there is still space! rebecca 1 min read march 22, 2015 no reply family travel: turks and caicos family travel, travel for the first time ever, we went away for march break. even before kids, andy and i never spent my university reading week away. i always worked. but, thanks to circumstances (primarily being my parents offering up their extra room in the condo they rent in turks) we decided it would be a great opportunity to go. we surprised the kids the night before our flight. they expected to go to school the next day, and instead we told them we’d be hopping on a plane to a sunny destination where their grandparents were. this was met with great enthusiasm. it was a march break to remember. the weather was incredible and i’m not sure we’ll ever see a beach with the blue water and powder sand beach like this again. the week was spent relaxing, swimming, reading and enjoying not only each other’s company, but also the change in temperatures. our return was met with snow and cold, but we have our pictures to remind us of the warmth and gentle breeze. rebecca 1 min read march 11, 2015 no reply march break activities in ottawa 2015 around ottawa, kids march break is coming up for many kids in the ottawa area! for the first time ever, we are travelling south for march break. normally, i plan the break around museum visits and play dates so here are a few events taking place this week! events around ottawa happening for march break 1-dinosaur train live on stage* do you have your tickets for dinosaur train live on stage at centrepointe theatres? i love a good stage show, and this looks like a lot of fun! plus, every time i write or say dinosaur train i end up with the song in my head! 2- minecraft at the canada aviation and space museum i’m told that a lot of the sessions for the 8-10 year olds are sold out, but if you have older kids, there may still be space! plus, the museum is fabulous to visit anyway! 3- tag along toys* our favourite toy store is running special promotions and craft take-aways each day during the break. it’s a great time to stock up on crafts or science activities, plus let the kids make and take! 4- city of ottawa museums* the city of ottawa museums are packed with daily drop in programs. become a space ranger at the cumberland museum, or journey to the moon at billing estate national historic site. 5- ottawa public library many of the libraries across the city of march break programs that are free! 6- visit a sugar bush it’s maple syrup time! rejoice! capital parent newspaper has a great article about where to find sugar bushes in ottawa. we often take the drive to sand road maple farm too! *blog advertisers rebecca 2 min read march 9, 2015 3 replies around ottawa: minecraft workshop at the canada aviation and space museum kids this weekend, i signed my son up for the mining and gaming workshop at the canada aviation and space museum. basically, he played minecraft with other kids his age for 3 hours. and yes, he loved it. the workshop is divided into two different time slots by age (beginning at age 8) and has been running since the end of february on select days for march break. it continues next weekend and throughout march break in the ottawa area. while the kids share a special server and play the game as usual by finding minerals and more, there is a twist: each session group is working towards building a spaceship. this means that certain materials will be better than others to use, that they have to work as a team and get creative in their design. it’s chaos at first but really fun to see how the group comes together to complete their task. the museum will be putting photos of the finished ships on facebook. the event takes place in the auditorium which is set up with large screen computers (one for each participant) and a display about space and mining. there is a large screen at the front of the room as well that follows the teacher participants. the teachers start the day with a short presentation at the beginning about space and mining and what the goal of the morning is. then they dig right in and the rest of the time is spent playing and gathering materials and then making their group spaceship. the kids all had an understanding of the game already and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. my son has said ‘thank you’ for signing him up multiple times and has said he would do it again (hint hint mom). if you are looking for a half-day march break activity for your kids and they are 8 years old or older, this may be the perfect spot. the workshop costs $25 but that includes entry into the museum as well. details, dates, ages and registration information can be found on the website. facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube grab a coffee and join me!
