(and the sleep. i mentioned that, right?) rebecca 0 min read may 7, 2016 no reply watch this mother’s day video! parenting i had the fun opportunity to appear in the good night sleep site mother’s day video. i’ve been working with alanna in regards to social media for some time now and it was fun to do something a little different, and to get in front of the camera. i love all of the advice and comments that the consultants give and i included my own tidbit about what my mother has taught me over the years. happy mother’s day! rebecca 4 min read april 26, 2016 no reply mother’s day, hot coffee and entrepreneurship food and drink moms, how many times a day do you reheat your coffee? how many cups a day do you drink? or how many do you feel that you need to function? i can remember when my first child was born there was a clear correlation between the morning and my need for coffee. it became a habit, a ritual where i was able to pour myself a cup and enjoy a few moments of relaxation, whether he was playing or napping. it’s funny how motherhood and coffee seem to go hand in hand. we talk about it, tweet about it, share photos of it, yearn for it, debate about it (there are parents who don’t drink coffee?!), we develop entire conversations and outings based on coffee. “grabbing a cup of coffee” together is part of the motherhood community i think. and these coffee dates existed long before any of us were making a cup in a single serve brewer or finding our way to a fancy coffee shop. our mothers and grandmothers did this too. coffee is also a part of our business lives. for entrepreneurs, coffee meetings are just part doing business. pots of coffee have been brewed in preparation for new programs to be launched, new plans made and special events to happen. we have etched out short term ideas using our children’s markers while sipping a cup of coffee. we have nervously wrote, and rewrote, an important pitch email while waiting for the pot to brew. how did we become so entrenched in the coffee culture? i’m sure there are great papers and articles written about the connection. i don’t question it, but i do live it. when melitta canada reached out to me to tell me about their brand history, i was intrigued. they have coffee available at major grocery stores (including fair trade which is what i buy), but beyond that, i was really interested to hear their story. the more i heard about it after our initial chats, the more i was intrigued. because their story is rooted in motherhood, entrepreneurship and the demand for better coffee. sounds like a great read, right? the founder, melitta bentz, was a mother and entrepreneur. i think many of us can relate to the creation of a business out of necessity and drive. i know many women in my life who have created successful businesses as mothers, with little ones under foot. melitta bentz invented the coffee filter. pretty neat, right? something most of us use everyday, and in 1908, she changed how coffee was being made. what did she use? what she had on hand – her son’s blotting paper from a school book. (you can read more about the company’s history on their site.) i love this story! a mom invented something that many of us continue to use today as we worship our hot cup of coffee in the morning. the mother of invention and all that… to all the entrepreneur moms out there, i raise my steaming hot cup of coffee to you this mother’s day! what does coffee mean to you? do you associate it with your business? with motherhood? both? bonus: forget the play dates and the business meetings, you need a sweet treat! want to add a little more coffee to your life this mother’s day? try these recipes. melitta’s website has some drool worthy recipes that would be a perfect addition to your mother’s day brunch table and i wanted to share them. i love the look of this chocolate pecan pie, or the cranberry biscotti recipe! disclosure: this post was sponsored by melitta and i received compensation, however, opinions are my own. it’s no secret that i am forever in love with a good cup of coffee. for the record, there is no better cup than the very first one of the day. ever. rebecca 1 min read may 7, 2015 no reply around ottawa: mother’s day at ottawa museums around ottawa, lifestyle once again, the city of ottawa museums have fun activities planned for mother’s day! we are all crossing our fingers for a gorgeous day weather-wise on sunday, but even if we have to put on some rain boots, there are plenty of events happening. from tea-time, flower arrangements, cupcakes and more, kids will love spoiling mom (and having fun!) at one of the museums. check out the following events, all taking place on sunday, may 10! more details are on the website. cumberland heritage village museum a mini tea, mini make over, interactive activities and photo booths will keep the family busy! billings estate national historic site while the museum is hosting a tea, it’s sold out, this is the one we went to at christmas and loved, but the museum is still open and the grounds are nice!) fairfields heritage house have a garden party and tea with mom! plus, kids can make a mother’s day card. nepean museum say cheers to mom with lemonade and cupcakes at the nepean museum and then make some flowers for mom. (while there, check out the war craft exhibit!) pinhey’s point historic site mother’s day is also opening day for pinhey’s point historic site! celebrate by arranging flowers, victorian style! rebecca 0 min read may 13, 2012 3 replies mother’s day – laughter, warmth and love parenting some sleeping in, delicious breakfast cooked by my family, a trip to parliament hill for a walk on a sunny, gorgeous day, bakery goodies, and family fun with my parents, siblings and their families basically leaves mother’s day a success. i have a warm heart and feel very loved and surrounded by wonderful people. i hope your mother’s day was wonderful and i send warm thoughts to those of you who are missing their mother’s or have motherhood in their hearts. rebecca 3 min read may 10, 2012 6 replies 4 free gifts to give this mother’s day kids, parenting from my first mother's day with both kids even though i like to think mom’s should be doted on year-round, sunday is mother’s day which hopefully means a little extra something special for moms. i have to admit, i’m spoiled with love all the time, but this day is always nice. sometimes we go out, sometimes we just stay in and enjoy the day together. this year we’ll be spending it together just the four of us, and then joining all of my family to celebrate with my mom. it should be a very fun day. while i love getting chocolate and flowers and books (year round even), here are a few gifts (aimed to moms with kids still at home) to give that are some of my favourite that cost nothing (or next to nothing at least). the point: to show her how special she is. it’s not about the gifts – it’s about the thought. remember – there is not too many times to say ‘thank you’ and ‘i love you’! 1 – let mom sleep in honestly, this is what i want. and for me, sleeping in could be 8 am (especially if we decide to go do something). but sleep, especially for mothers with young children, is still highly coveted and valued. 2 – her favourite food (at home or out – it doesn’t matter, but depending on the age of the kids, whatever involves the least stress!) make mom her favourite meal or treat or incorporate it some how. it can be breakfast in bed (although, i have a feeling that may be tricky here) or have the kids help put together a tasty surprise. don’t forget the coffee, but let the adults take care of that. the key here: she doesn’t do the planning (or shopping preferably) or the clean up. a few years ago i got a steak and lobster meal cooked by andy. that was pretty impressive. 3 – home made gifts/cards it may sound corny, but when your kids run up to you with something they made just for you, you can’t help but feel special right? they get very excited about their creations and i love that. it’s very special. not sure what to make dads? do something simple like painting or stickers on folded paper to make a card. or check out these flower crafts by momstown. 4 – spend time together – but relax we have a pretty clear ‘no cooking or cleaning’ rule on father’s day and mother’s day (for whoever is the ‘parent’ of honour). i like that rule. i look at mother’s day as being perfect when i’m surrounded by the family. i love a little sleep in, even some quiet time to read a book, but i want to spend the day with the kids doing something we all enjoy. on nice days this may mean drive to somewhere outside, play time at a park etc. even though we’ll be joining the rest of my family in the afternoon, having some special time – where i don’t have to worry about a meal, about cleaning, about laundry – together in the morning will make my day wonderful. how will you be spending mother’s day if you are celebrating (as a mom or with a mom!) facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube grab a coffee and join me! welcome to a little bit of momsense! my name is rebecca and i'm chatting about parenting, family friendly activities, yummy recipes, family travel, and living a life full of love and laughter. thanks for stopping by! fabulous advertisers, friends and affiliates for content tips and support – subscribe! use code momsense10 to save 20% this error message is only visible to wordpress admins error: the account for needs to be reconnected. due to recent instagram platform changes this instagram account needs to be reconnected in order to continue updating. reconnect on plugin settings page visit rebecca's profile on pinterest. tags activities activities with kids activity around ottawa baseball birthdays blogging centrepointe theatres children christmas disney junior family family activities family time family travel food gift guide giveaway halloween holidays home kids kraft canada learning march break mothers day netflix ottawa ottawa events parenting pei pinterest play preschool activity recipe recipes school shopping sobeys summer tag along toys terra20 thanksgiving theatre travel archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 missed a post?
