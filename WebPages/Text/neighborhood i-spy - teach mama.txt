let’s get those kiddos out and moving, biking, walking, skipping, or scooting. everyone else (who is up for it!) can display a few easy-to-find or easy-to-make items on their windows, door, driveway, whatever. here’s the skinny. . . neighborhood i-spy it’s all about being together, but apart right now, right? right. there are a ton of ways to do just that. and now, more than ever, it’s important that we try to keep things light—and even fun!—for our children. so together, as a community, you can play neighborhood i-spy without even ever coming in contact with neighbors. the closest you get will be a wave from your windows! you can add a few of these items to your windows each day, or if you want to add everything at once, that’s fine, too. figure out what works best for your neighborhood or community. maybe you love rainbows and only want to do the rainbow one. great! go crazy with rainbows. maybe you love animals–then put a bunch of fish and dogs in your windows. maybe you are so tired that you can only manage to draw a funny face on looseleaf paper with a sharpie? fine!! hang it in the window and wave like crazy when kids walk by–then they can check off that they saw a funny face and happy neighbor. it’s easy. it’ll be fun. remember this: it does not have to be perfect. just do what you can, if you feel so inclined. our neighborhood did a shamrock hunt over the st. patrick’s day week. and watching all of our favorite little neighbors walk around and count the shamrocks on my windows brought everyone under this roof so much joy. why not try it again, in a new way? get the neighborhood i-spy to use in your ‘hood. grab the poster and the little sheet that kids can use by signing up for teachmama updates below: check out a few other posts that may help you develop strong and healthy habits for your family: wait time my day, your day frozen peas kids who rock the kitchen kids who rock the laundry rest time gem jars arm circles noticing kids homework routine fyi: some of the links in the post above are “affiliate links.” this means if you click on the link and purchase the item, i will receive an affiliate commission. forever and always i recommend only products or services i use personally and believe will add value to my readers. i am disclosing this in accordance with the federal trade commission’s 16 cfr, part 255: “guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising.” for more information, please see teachmama media, llc. disclosure policy. related posts free hand washing posters: coronavirus 2020 we may have three 'big kids' in our house, but we all still need reminders… click to learn more homeschooling schedule during coronavirus school closings here is our official homeschooling schedule during the current coronavirus school closings. school at home.… click to learn more get kids to cook: weekly meal plan sheet kids are all home from school for who knows how long, so let's get kids… click to learn more how our first week of homeschooling really went week one of school at home is officially in the books. kids have been here,… click to learn more everything free and awesome online to do while kids are home: classes, crafts, virtual tours and more make it through the coronavirus outbreak with these free, awesome things to do online right… click to learn more comments comments 03 | 22 | 2020 leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website our books & freebies email sign-up: success! now quickly head over and check your email to confirm your subscription. you don't want to miss this! there was an error submitting your subscription. please try again. email address subscribe archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 search this site tags 0-2 years 3-5 years 6-8 years 9-12 years alphabet behavior books cooking cool & creative counting crafts creative kids critical thinking digital literacy early literacy elementary schoolers family fun family life family time fine motor skills food games giveaway giving back gratitude holidays homework time indoor learning listening math middle schoolers new for us friday outdoor learning parenting preschoolers printables read-aloud learning reading school science speaking sponsored post summer fun vlogs writing instagram recent pins more pins you tube check out our channel! about contact disclaimer terms of use privacy policy site-map copyright © 2020 · teach mama media, llc · designed by smitten blog designs · privacy policy · log in
