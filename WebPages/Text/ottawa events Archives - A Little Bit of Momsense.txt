finally, another fantastic gift might be for yourself and a group of friends to plan an evening together. dinner, a broadway performance, and time spent together sounds like a perfect way to kick of a new year. interested in gifting tickets to beautiful: a carole king musical? you can find show days and availability on the broadway across canada website where you can also purchase tickets. lastly, if you want to go to the show yourself, you donâ€™t need a reason to give it to you â€“ you already deserve it! beautiful: the carole king musical is in ottawa between january 1 and january 6 at the nac. rebecca 2 min read january 22, 2015 24 replies enter to win tickets to see dinosaur train at centrepointe theatres! kids, parenting ready to win a pack of 4 tickets to see dinosaur train live on stage at centrepointe theatres?
