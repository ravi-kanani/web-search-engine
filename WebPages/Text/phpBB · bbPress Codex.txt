[youtube] – you will have to manually change these yourself either before importing in phpbb or after importing into bbpress using phpmyadmin. smilies are rendered as images if contained in ‘code’ tags eg. <code>:)</code> no file attachments are imported. all ‘ordered lists’ <ol> will be displayed as numerical lists. you may find extra page breaks <br> and paragraph <p> elements in topics and replies and is less than ideal and is from the way the bbcodes are converted during the forum import conversion. you will find these primarily around ‘blockquotes’ and ‘lists’ if you are using bbpress ‘show lead topic’ some of the formatting will be broken, it has been converted correctly and is an issue with the content-single-topic-lead.php template, see trac # (ticket to follow). <span> elements seem to be a hit and miss at the moment, they render sometimes and sometimes not depending on the import. (not very helpful i know, still digging around this issue) <img src=”http://example.com/file.jpg> are not currently enabled to be embedded inline in bbpress by default with topics and replies, everything was converted correctly and we just need to throw some switches and push some buttons before the next release of bbpress to make it work, watch this space. users phpbb does not support user profile support for ‘first name’ and ‘last name’ only ‘member_name’ and that will be the wordpress username. existing passwords are converted during the import so users can login to wordpress/bbpress as soon as the import and recounts have finished. phpbb moderators, groups, ranks are not imported, any users you wish to make ‘moderators’ or ‘keymasters’ you will have to assign these roles manually via the main wordpress admin user panel (/wp-admin/users.php). user ‘personal messages (pm’s) are not supported or imported. user ‘avatars’ are also not supported ‘out of the box’ by either wordpress or bbpress, if the users email address is registered with a ‘gravatar this will automatically be used by wordpress and bbpress, otherwise this is plugin territory. (see note #1 below) phpbb signatures, location, occupation and interests custom profile fields are also not supported by wordpress or bbpress ‘out of the box’. (see note #2 below) references https://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php?mode=bbcode notes note #1 – phpbb user avatars the phpbb avatar filename used in phpbb user avatars is imported and stored in the wp_usermeta table as ‘_bbp_phpbb_old_user_avatar_filename’. phpbb stores user avatars in /phpbbv3/images/avatars/upload/ and with some tom foolery i am quite sure these can be imported into wp’s media library and with the right plugin enabled quite easily. note #2 – phpbb custom user profile fields stored in wp_usermeta. the following custom profile fields are imported into wp_usermeta and as you build your community with wordpress and bbpress, maybe buddypress also this should help down the road in converting these values to whatever plugins and profile extensions you decide to use. icq – ‘_bbp_phpbb_old_user_icq’ msn messenger – ‘_bbp_phpbb_old_user_msnm’ occupation – ‘_bbp_phpbb_old_user_occ’ user insterests – ‘_bbp_phpbb_old_user_interest location ‘_bbp_phpbb_old_user_location’ signature ‘_bbp_phpbb_old_user_signature’ (all bbcode is also converted here into html) contents phpbb v3.x importer for bbpress → references → notes → note #1 - phpbb user avatars → note #2 - phpbb custom user profile fields stored in wp_usermeta. → similar aef bbpress 1.x & buddypress group forums custom import drupal e107 fluxbb import troubleshooting invision kunena (joomla) mingle mybb phorum phpbb phpfox punbb simplepress smf tender vanilla vbulletin wp symposium xenforo xmb register lost password log in article contributors 32 stephen edgar 3 robkk updated 5 years ago / published 7 years ago want to help? the bbpress codex is volunteer-powered, which means you can contribute too! if you're interested in updating existing articles or creating entirely new ones, please read our codex standards & guidelines. see also: wordpress.org • bbpress.org • buddypress.org • matt • blog rss follow bbpress on twitter • gpl • contact us • privacy • terms of service skip to toolbar wordpress.org about wordpress documentation support forums feedback developer trac developer blog bbpress.org about bbpress documentation support forums feedback developer trac developer blog buddypress.org about buddypress documentation support forums feedback developer trac developer blog bbpress.org anonymous anonymousnot logged in register lost password log in
