ðŸ˜‰ now, in all seriousness, this really works well. we know to grab the pillow case and all the bedding is inside. but iâ€™m not very good at making it look pretty i guess. i am still happy with it! ha! i couldnâ€™t stop laughing while i was doing it. check out this hilarious site for other people in my predicament. you know i nailed it. eventually maybe iâ€™ll share a pinterest idea that works for me â€“ have similar stories?
