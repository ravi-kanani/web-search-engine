(1, 2 or 3 points per item). printable ‚Äì scavenger hunt list (blank) of the 10 items, you‚Äôll probably want about 5 to be worth 1 point, 3 worth 2 and 2 items worth three. at the cottage, we used whatever we had around to make the list. every player in the game needs a sheet of paper, so you‚Äôll be writing the list out for each player! 4) lastly, every play has a home base basket (a laundry bin works well). this is where they will collect items. you can place their basket anywhere but they need to add the items they find to the basket. so if they have an item in their hand when the timer goes, and not in their bin, the points don‚Äôt count. 5) before the game begins, participants need to be secluded somewhere while you hide the items. decide if any rooms are off limits, or if the outdoor are is included in their search. (tip: make bathrooms off limits) hide the items. 6) set your timer for either 15 or 20 minutes (depending on how hard you are making the hiding) then, once the items and bonus cards are hidden, start the timer and send players on their way. they hunt and bring their items to the baskets to ensure they get their points at the end. tip: this is a great game to play on a rainy day! 7) at the end of the timer, anyone with the bonus minute can enjoy searching without the other players. when their minute is up, the scores are tallied. my eldest running to beat his sister to an item they found you can vary the game as much as you like, but it‚Äôs great with only the two players, more players, or even as teams! to recap: every item get assigned a point. items and bonus cards are hidden. kids stay in a secluded area while you hide them. each of the players has a home base basket where items have to be dropped off. set the timer. kids hunt until timer goes. points tallied. have fun! (we made this up on the fly, so if i didn‚Äôt explain something clearly, please send me a message and i‚Äôll try to expand! üòâ rebecca 1 min read october 28, 2019 no reply tickets available: ottawa family-friendly dance performance november 2 around ottawa this post is in partnership with shenkman arts centre on november 2, introduce your kids to a live dance performance on stage at the shenkman arts centre. tickets are available for the 26 letter dance by bouge de l√†. this is a family-friendly performance combines contemporary dance with bright and playful scenes that young audience goers will enjoy. here‚Äôs more information about the 26 letter dance: an interactive, multidisciplinary alphabet primer, the 26 letter dance is a journey into the world of letters and words. physically and intellectually engaged in the piece, the young spectator is an active participant in this kaleidoscope rich in colours and textured dance. in this bold and playful work, choreographer h√©l√®ne langevin invites children to take part in a unique experience in which they not only see a dance performance, but actively participate in the various tableaux that punctuate the piece‚Äìloosely structured miniatures. the show gets underway with a, of course, with z the last to take his leave. in between, the letters in this alphabet book embody a plethora of words, meanings, emotions and tones of voice. ‚Äì from the shenkman arts centre website tickets are available at $20 each for adults and $15 for kids, but a family of four can be purchased at a discount. the performance is recommend for children aged 4 and up. every time i‚Äôve gone to a stage performance with the kids at shenkman, i have always loved it (and the kids too!) for more information, or to purchase your tickets online, visit the shenkman arts centre website! rebecca 2 min read march 28, 2017 32 replies enter to win: lego gift pack #legocityoftomorrow play giveaway now closed. thanks! are you huge fans of lego? we love lego so i was extremely excited when lego sent me a limited-edition mini figure. look at the freckles! just like me! included in my super sweet package were a set of lego city bricks. one of my favourite things with lego isn‚Äôt necessarily creating the pre-established package results, but being left to create anything i want. it seems the kids are like that too. my daughter instantly got creative and was inspired by the #legocityoftomorrow idea. she was busy creating the day i got the package. however, that also sparked her interest even more and she pulled out the rest of our legos to build. check out the great surfer wave she made! i love that she didn‚Äôt have instructions to follow and yet was innovative enough to figure out how to create the wave so it felt like it was moving. the lego city of tomorrow pieces are perfectly timed as we all celebrate canada‚Äôs 150. we can all get creative and build mini cities of our own. upcoming events ‚Äì april 8th and 9th the good news is, to celebrate #legocity150, there are lego events happening at toys r us in many locations across the country and they have a special contest for a chance to win a trip to ottawa! click here for more details on the april 8th and 9th event locations and times at toys r us or to enter their big giveaway. enter to win want to win a mini pack of lego city bricks?

i find the two characters enduring and fun and the way the stories are told are engrossing from the start. this is, to me, exactly how a children‚Äôs book should be. you may remember reading that my daughter chose to read an elephant and piggie in french for the speaking competition at the school last year (you can read about that here). it was an easy decision for her once we found the french book at the library. she even did the voices! that‚Äôs why i am so excited to share that centrepointe theatres is hosting elephant and piggie‚Äôs ‚Äúwe are in a play!‚Äù on march 25! i‚Äôm less excited that we are unable to attend ourselves because of other commitments, but i am over the moon to tell you all about it and excited that other families can be introduced to these lovable characters. this is a live action musical that was written by mo willems himself. the show is recommended for kindergarten and grade one students, but i know for a fact that my older kids would enjoy it. i imagine this will be a popular show. buy your tickets today to avoid disappointment. what‚Äôs even better is that if you attend the show ahead of time, from 12 pm until 1 pm, the nepean visual arts center is hosting a pre-show craft. the kids can make their own elephant and piggies! this would be a fun way to introduce kids to musical theatre and share in some fun. also, stay tuned to this blog ‚Äì i have a couple more things to share with you about elephant and piggie that you won‚Äôt want to miss, especially if you are a fan like we are! elephant and piggie are in a play at @centrepointet on march 25! buy your tickets today #ottawa! click to tweet watch a preview here: rebecca 2 min read december 5, 2016 no reply have fun in the snow! parenting if you are in the ottawa area, you woke up to a lot of snow on the ground this morning. it has been met with mixed feelings i think. a lot of people are excited, others could do without it. i‚Äôm somewhere in between. i hate driving in the snow but love the look of it around the holidays. the kids, however, are thrilled. their school recess just got even more exciting. it also means that they can get outside to the sledding hills! near our house we have a small hill that we can slide on in the winter, when the snow is covering it enough and it‚Äôs not too icy. it‚Äôs within walking distance and almost every snow day, if the conditions are right, we head outside to slide down, walk up, and slide down again. to do that, you need the right equipment. firstly, you have to bundle up to stay warm and dry. secondly, you need something that moves well on the snow! i think these inflatables at tag along toys look like so much fun. they are unique in appearance, but they definitely appear to give the right amount speed that you want when heading down the hill. it‚Äôs tempting for me to go out and buy one now that the snow has arrived (and will possibly stay this time!) these would make for amazing christmas gifts (tip: blow them up on christmas eve for a major ‚Äòwow‚Äô when the kids see them the next morning!) or, they‚Äôd be fun to have just because, ready to go out and hit the hills at any moment. do you have a favourite one? i love the donut tube, but the polar bear looks like a lot of fun as well! visit tag along toys all this week to save $5 on each of the inflatable snow tubes (until sunday!!) donut snow tube polar bear snow tube peppermint snow tube snow cone snow tube these inflatable snow tubes from @tagalongtoys would be fun for the winter ~@bitofmomsense click to tweet bundle up, get outside and enjoy the snow! disclosure: tag along toys is a blog advertiser. all opinions are my own. rebecca 1 min read june 22, 2011 1 reply summer memories kids, parenting last week when i had the kids out back in the sprinkler i got to thinking about how children love the water ‚Äì even freezing cold water ‚Äì and how much fun i had as a child playing in the sprinkler, swimming and then i remembered the slip and slide. although in my head i remember it as the banana slide and it had a banana attachment for the end of the hose but still that long yellow tarp. i remember laughing, sliding all over it, randomly hurting ourselves if we slipped to hard or tried to be smart and slide standing up. i remember the little pieces of grass all over our bodies, especially if dad had recently cut the grass. then i was thinking about other summer fun. roasting marshmallows by a warm fire. playing hide and seek in the corn field between the stalks. riding our bikes to our grandfather‚Äôs farm. the drive-in movies. before the days when we became too-cool to play or when we reached the age our summer was filled with a part time job, the relaxing days of summer were care free and full of childish fun. but oh how i remember the laughing. it was so much fun. now, as i watch my children enjoy the spoils of summer, i am satisfied knowing they are building their own memories. i hope they remember how the grass felt on their feet too. what are some of your favourite summer memories that make you smile?
