(and i‚Äôm betting if there were jewels or glitter somehow involved, i could rope cora in as well.) here‚Äôs the skinny: quick and easy math game‚Äìstrike it out: it‚Äôs called ‚Äòstrike it out‚Äô but if you ask me, it‚Äôs far from a strikeout. quick, easy, and a game to be played anywhere, even on the fly? love it. the premise is simple: players use the numbers on a number line to try to prevent their opponent from being able to make a move, and moves are made by creating addition or subtraction problems using the available numbers. 1. start by drawing a number line from 0-20 like this: 2. the first player chooses a number on the number line and crosses it out. the same player then chooses a second number and crosses that out, too. finally, he or she circles the sum or difference of the two numbers and writes down the calculation. 3. the second player must start by crossing off the number that player one has just circled. he or she then chooses another number to cross out and then circles a third number which is the sum or difference of the two crossed-off numbers. player two also writes down the calculation. 4. play continues in this way with each player starting with the number that has just been circled. for example, player one could then have a turn which would leave the game looking like this: yes! there‚Äôs a typo: 20-4= 16 *yikes!* 5. the winner of the game is the player who stops his or her opponent from making a move. do you want this game to use with your children or students? sure you do! huge thanks to the 2nd grade team at our elementary school for ‚Äògiving‚Äô us this game! i love, love, love it, and it‚Äôs become a sneaky way to get maddy and owen playing with numbers and practicing addition and subtraction. these teachers are incredible, and we are so thankful. if you want strike it out as a quick and easy printable (with a few blank number lines to use!), it‚Äôs here as a pdf: strike it out! nothing like a game like this to play while waiting in lines, at doctor‚Äôs offices, restaurants, or the like! ______________________ ______________________ follow us on instagram: @teachmama1 want a little more math fun?

i taught second grade, and i feel like this was one of their games. i love, love, love everyday math, and of course i had to supplement and make my own materials based on class/individual needs, but as a whole, it was my favorite math program. i still have some of my materials and have been saving them for my kids. by nature, i am not math-inclined, but i actually enjoy teaching math more than reading. i wonder why that is! reply amy says december 8, 2011 at 9:42 am micaela‚Äìi‚Äôm not sure. i can ask her teacher, though‚Äìnow i‚Äôm curious. that‚Äôs so interesting that you enjoy teaching math more than reading!! if you‚Äôre up for sharing something that works for your kiddos, let me know!! i need all the help i can get! üôÇ reply dana says december 8, 2011 at 7:28 am well could you adopt a kid b‚Äôs age so you will get to the bridge sooner?
