(and i’m betting if there were jewels or glitter somehow involved, i could rope cora in as well.) here’s the skinny: quick and easy math game–strike it out: it’s called ‘strike it out’ but if you ask me, it’s far from a strikeout. quick, easy, and a game to be played anywhere, even on the fly? love it. the premise is simple: players use the numbers on a number line to try to prevent their opponent from being able to make a move, and moves are made by creating addition or subtraction problems using the available numbers. 1. start by drawing a number line from 0-20 like this: 2. the first player chooses a number on the number line and crosses it out. the same player then chooses a second number and crosses that out, too. finally, he or she circles the sum or difference of the two numbers and writes down the calculation. 3. the second player must start by crossing off the number that player one has just circled. he or she then chooses another number to cross out and then circles a third number which is the sum or difference of the two crossed-off numbers. player two also writes down the calculation. 4. play continues in this way with each player starting with the number that has just been circled. for example, player one could then have a turn which would leave the game looking like this: yes! there’s a typo: 20-4= 16 *yikes!* 5. the winner of the game is the player who stops his or her opponent from making a move. do you want this game to use with your children or students? sure you do! huge thanks to the 2nd grade team at our elementary school for ‘giving’ us this game! i love, love, love it, and it’s become a sneaky way to get maddy and owen playing with numbers and practicing addition and subtraction. these teachers are incredible, and we are so thankful. if you want strike it out as a quick and easy printable (with a few blank number lines to use!), it’s here as a pdf: strike it out! nothing like a game like this to play while waiting in lines, at doctor’s offices, restaurants, or the like! ______________________ ______________________ follow us on instagram: @teachmama1 want a little more math fun?

i taught second grade, and i feel like this was one of their games. i love, love, love everyday math, and of course i had to supplement and make my own materials based on class/individual needs, but as a whole, it was my favorite math program. i still have some of my materials and have been saving them for my kids. by nature, i am not math-inclined, but i actually enjoy teaching math more than reading. i wonder why that is! reply amy says december 8, 2011 at 9:42 am micaela–i’m not sure. i can ask her teacher, though–now i’m curious. that’s so interesting that you enjoy teaching math more than reading!! if you’re up for sharing something that works for your kiddos, let me know!! i need all the help i can get! 🙂 reply dana says december 8, 2011 at 7:28 am well could you adopt a kid b’s age so you will get to the bridge sooner? reply amy says december 8, 2011 at 9:41 am ha! how about you figure a little something out for us both? 🙂 xoxo reply pl3453 understand th1s says december 27, 2011 at 3:06 pm fun and easy math game | teach mama is a fantastic illustration for article advertising. article marketing is the particular method of writing and submitting articles for the main goal of integrating anchor backlinks to your website and it is one of many quickest and most effective link building methods around the world. reply robin says june 22, 2014 at 9:51 pm wonderful idea for my bright math girl. thanks for sharing. smiles… 20-4=16. looked like there was a typo: ) reply amy mascott says june 23, 2014 at 11:32 am ha!! yes. . . robin–good eyes. you’re right. typo!! reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * comment name * email * website our books & freebies email sign-up: success! now quickly head over and check your email to confirm your subscription. you don't want to miss this! there was an error submitting your subscription. please try again. email address subscribe archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 august 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 search this site tags 0-2 years 3-5 years 6-8 years 9-12 years alphabet behavior books cooking cool & creative counting crafts creative kids critical thinking digital literacy early literacy elementary schoolers family fun family life family time fine motor skills food games giveaway giving back gratitude holidays homework time indoor learning listening math middle schoolers new for us friday outdoor learning parenting preschoolers printables read-aloud learning reading school science speaking sponsored post summer fun vlogs writing instagram recent pins more pins you tube check out our channel! about contact disclaimer terms of use privacy policy site-map copyright © 2020 · teach mama media, llc · designed by smitten blog designs · privacy policy · log in 184 12.7k 12.8kshares
