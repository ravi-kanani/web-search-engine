petite anglaise august 27, 2009 quickie filed under: book stuff — petiteanglaiseparis @ 2:52 pm in honour of official ‘french kissing’ publication day, i just wanted to answer a lot of the queries i’ve been receiving on facebook and by email about the novel’s availability abroad. as things currently stand, i only have a doubleday canada release date – march 2010. the penguin uk version should be available in the high street bookshops in the uk, throughout the commonwealth and in a selection of english language bookshops abroad (including wh smiths in paris). in the meantime, if you are outside the uk and wish to get your hands on a copy, your best bet is probably to order it from the book depository – it’s reasonably priced and they will ship it anywhere in the world for free. i do hope you enjoy it. so. shameless self-promotion over. i shall now go back to fretting about what my friends and family think of it. aie! share this: twitter facebook related comments (37) 37 comments petite, if we didn’t want to know about your latest(!) volume we wouldn’t be subscribed to your blog. all the best for ‘french kissing’, even if i am less than enamoured of the title the publishers have given it. comment by john norris — august 27, 2009 @ 3:43 pm fun! i’ll keep my eyes open for it at the english language store here…hopefully they will bring it in. comment by the cowgirl — august 27, 2009 @ 4:00 pm shameless self-promotion is the golden key in publishing these days, given the publishers expect it of us poor writers now. so go for it, petite anglaise. and now i’ll go find me a copy of your book. miss footloose, whose foot got stuck in paris once by mistake, and it took 2 entire days to get it unstuck, but she loved it so much, she came back another time and footloosed all around. http://www.lifeintheexpatlane.blogspot.come tales of the globetrotting life comment by miss footloose — august 27, 2009 @ 4:15 pm “throughout the commonwealth” good to hear we are still supporting the colonies ;-) comment by nick — august 27, 2009 @ 4:21 pm i agree it’s kind of an odd term to use, but publishing contracts always do refer to ‘uk and commonwealth’ – and depending on the contract, may or may not include canada (where i in fact signed a separate contract). comment by petite — august 27, 2009 @ 4:35 pm i’ll be keeping my eyes opened for it :) comment by l.c.t. — august 27, 2009 @ 4:48 pm congratulations on the new book, petite! some time ago i was worrying on your blog whether “tadpole” from your first book will get translated into german along with the rest of the text, since the idea of naming one’s lovely little daughter “kaulquappe” somewhat scared me… now, they do mention kaulquappe on amazon.de, but i do hope she remains tadpole in the translated book… i still don’t like the idea, you see. comment by alcessa — august 27, 2009 @ 5:17 pm wow, it must be such a buzz to be awaiting the publication or your literary baby, i’m sure it was alot more difficult to concieve and took longer to gestate then your other impending arrival! and i have a feeling i am going to empathise with your heroine’s internet dating travails! good luck f comment by francaphile — august 27, 2009 @ 6:41 pm goodluck with your new book! comment by googlebear — august 27, 2009 @ 7:42 pm i enjoyed your book very much (in hebrew) and recommended it on my own blog. regarding french kissng – is there a kindle edition? good luck with your new book. comment by dana — august 27, 2009 @ 8:05 pm amazon uk doesn’t sell kindle editions.. so i guess it might come with the canadian version next march on amazon.com… comment by petite — august 27, 2009 @ 8:23 pm petite, i’ve ordered it on amazon. next question is: when is an official “dédicace” day? paris? london? this time i need you to write something for mine :-p (i’ll be in paris in october) comment by vonric — august 27, 2009 @ 9:26 pm haven’t visited for quite some time (do you have a twitter acct for pa?), and just saw you got one of them fancy novels all the kids are talking about. let me get this straight. you’re an expatriate novelist living in pari.? can i be honest? i kind of hate you a just a little. comment by curt — august 27, 2009 @ 9:31 pm i received my copy through amazon two days ago. yet to find time to sit and read. comment by christine — august 27, 2009 @ 9:38 pm thanks for the hint about book depository. i’ve ordered it and it was easy and lightning fast and cheaper than amazon u.k. i didn’t want to wait any longer! comment by steve g — august 27, 2009 @ 9:42 pm love the free world wide shipping! just sent a copy to myself in california comment by victoria — august 28, 2009 @ 7:08 am hmmm, after reading that advertising blurb, i’m doubly curious. will have to get myself over to wh smith p.d.q. and get a copy! hey, if you find yourself at loose ends some afternoon (after we do the school rentrée next week, of course) and want to have coffee, let’s do it. last time (i recall with a smile) that we had coffee was when i told you about my finnish friend who met a great guy in paris on a dating sight… and now look at the two of us! does art imitate life or is it the other way around?

elsa, une française à londres, prof de français pour étrangers ! comment by elzaz — september 1, 2009 @ 10:00 pm i got engaged on the same day that french kissing was published. it was a total surprise for me, but the timing was apt as i am a fan of the blog and the p.a. book. also it was our third anniversary! shameless self-promotion over. i await my copy from the book depository and expect it is at least as good as linzi thinks. good luck with the new petit! holly comment by shamelessly self-promoting holly — september 3, 2009 @ 1:11 am i’m about to order it on amazon :o) bonne chance petite – hoping its a wonderful success! x comment by la chat noir — september 3, 2009 @ 8:55 am superb one-sitting book (as per the other one), well done, bravo, highly readable and hugely enjoyable! comment by tiffany — september 3, 2009 @ 1:18 pm ps loved the lila turn of phrase, ‘…did xyz’, eg ‘i did never meet her before.’, likewise the continuity of the ‘transports amoureux’ which also made a really lovely ending comment by tiffany — september 3, 2009 @ 1:26 pm french kissing in the uk sid vicious meets blondie, eh? must be quite a read — i’m looking forward to it already. comment by roads — september 3, 2009 @ 6:24 pm the book is great. comment by aaron — september 5, 2009 @ 12:16 am look at this, the book is on the rankings! bookrankings.com/31749 comment by minous b — september 5, 2009 @ 4:14 am i followed your link–the free shipping got me! the first of yours came to me in colorado, and this one will be delivered to tampa, florida. needless to say, it’s been a long & crazy ride between your projects. i look forward to taking a break from grad school and reading this one during my (precious) free time! will let you know how much i love it once it gets here. thanks for the ordering info! comment by alyssa — september 6, 2009 @ 2:56 am rss feed for comments on this post. sorry, the comment form is closed at this time. search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
