(but nice as it was) comment by joeinvegas — november 24, 2005 @ 6:02 am :) very cute! comment by jimmmy — november 24, 2005 @ 7:10 am wonderful to hear her voice! that’s a keeper for sure for when she’s grown. more, more and tell us how you got that into the blog? all the best, caroline comment by caroline — november 24, 2005 @ 8:03 am lovely – the two little troopers keep saying “again again” and joining in. comment by universal soldier — november 24, 2005 @ 8:25 am and for my next trick, tonight i will try to get her to sing a french one, to the same tune, called “ah! vous dirais-je maman!” with her hands tied behind her back to prevent microphone fiddling. comment by petite — november 24, 2005 @ 9:32 am how cute is that?… isabel, are chillbumps the same as goose pimples? never heard the expression chillbumps before but it sounds like something my three year old daughter would say… comment by croque madame — november 24, 2005 @ 9:33 am well if she can do “ah vous dirai-je maman” as well as “twinkle…”, she’s a clever girl indeed, as the words are a lot more complicated. can’t wait to hear her! comment by céline — november 24, 2005 @ 9:40 am a couple of years ago, when my little girl was only four, we were sitting in the cafe in marks & spencer a few days before christmas, surrounded by middle class, middle aged shoppers. absolutely deliberately, i encouraged my little one to sing “away in a manger”, which she had just learnt at nursery. the cafe gradually fell silent, and by the end there was hardly a dry eye in the house. never underestimate the potency of cheap music, as noel coward said. comment by tony s — november 24, 2005 @ 9:52 am star ac next! comment by parkin pig — november 24, 2005 @ 10:10 am one of the little parisiennes that i babysit just learned the same tune, and has been practicing with me on the métro so she can do it really well for her english teacher. she is so proud of being able to sing in english, albeit with a cross between a french accent and an american one (mine). it’s fun to hear the differences and the similarities. and knowing how proud they both are just warms my heart. i taught her 10-year old sister “oh susannah!” on line 14 yesterday. she wants to be able to sing it in english while she plays it on the piano for her french (corsican) solfège teacher. thanks for sharing–your daughter has a beautiful voice! comment by ronica — november 24, 2005 @ 10:24 am magical! your blog gets more charming with each post… (sorry if this posts twice, my last attempt went into space.) comment by katherine — november 24, 2005 @ 1:12 pm how absolutely sweet! my sister (13 years my junior) used to sing ‘tinkle tinkle ickle tar’ at about the same age as tadpole. it brought back lovely memories . . . . comment by sandy — november 24, 2005 @ 1:38 pm back again cos i’ve just played this again and i’m dead chuffed to hear that your nipper has got a (flat vowelled) yorkshire accent! comment by parkin pig — november 24, 2005 @ 2:20 pm that is way too cute ! comment by magillicuddy — november 24, 2005 @ 2:34 pm oh…bless! comment by grannyp — november 24, 2005 @ 2:39 pm soooo sweet, has brightened my day no end. i only know one french nursery rhyme, that one that goes (and please excuse the dreadful spelling)… taper taper taper les mains tourner tourner petit moulin nager nager petit poison voler voler petite avione if you’re doing requests, can she sing this one next, please :) comment by cat — november 24, 2005 @ 2:45 pm again, again! comment by christina — november 24, 2005 @ 2:59 pm that was too cute! comment by juliana — november 24, 2005 @ 3:11 pm thanks, tadpole! comment by r j keefe — november 24, 2005 @ 3:33 pm yes, croque madame, they are the same thing. although i should have typed ‘chill bumps’, not ‘chillbumps’. and grownup people use the expression along with three-year-olds, i believe.;) comment by isabel — november 24, 2005 @ 4:01 pm my father has a tape of me singing from when i was three, which he breaks out annually to embarrass me. when my son hit three, he recorded him on the other side, and suddenly it became a treasured possession. it brought a tear to my eye to hear tadpole, knowing the pride you will feel listening to it as she ages. comment by 21st century woman — november 24, 2005 @ 4:59 pm ah ça c’est trop mignon!!! comment by eau — november 24, 2005 @ 5:58 pm that brought a smile to my face. cheers. comment by greg — november 24, 2005 @ 8:14 pm now that is what i call a lazy post… child labour, way past bedtime etc etc… (not really, i think it’s a great idea. oh the wonders of modern technology) comment by mancunian lass — november 24, 2005 @ 8:48 pm she’s not for sale, is she? comment by neptune, god of the seas — november 24, 2005 @ 9:36 pm i didn’t record it after bedtime, it just took me rather a long time to work out how to audioblog… might try and write some words tomorrow though. comment by petite — november 24, 2005 @ 9:54 pm fantastic!!! comment by renatta — november 24, 2005 @ 11:04 pm and if you play them simultaneously, you get a very john coltranesque free jazz thing going on. comment by easyjetsetter — november 24, 2005 @ 11:43 pm i love the last bit in french: “moi je dis que les bonbons valent mieux que la raison!” so cute. and i love the way she pronounces maman! with lots of accentuation on the 2 syllables! comment by maurine au bout du monde — november 25, 2005 @ 12:52 am that is just too adorable! of course i couldn’t really understand the french version (but that’s my bad french at fault for the most part) but she sure can carry the tune in both languages. maybe you’ve got a young chanteuse on your hands… is she channeling edith piaf? comment by lisa — november 25, 2005 @ 2:21 am we can really hear she is more on the brit side with her english accent when she sings in french. this is all very cute. comment by pink — november 25, 2005 @ 2:46 am my first post here, but i have lurked for quite a while. tadpole is adorable. the recording put a smile on my face. you are a superb writer, thank you for creating such a touching personal blog. comment by susjjan — november 25, 2005 @ 4:39 am i don’t know which version i find more adorable…ok i pick the french one!! it’s amazingly cute!! comment by eau — november 25, 2005 @ 9:50 am benisse! (if that’s the right version. a bit shakier on french…) comment by grannyp — november 25, 2005 @ 10:43 am that is the cutest thing ever, bless your daughter!! comment by red — november 25, 2005 @ 10:47 am oh dear petite. now i will have to wait until i get home, as playing tadpole’s tunes in the office would cause heads to turn! comment by rjh — november 25, 2005 @ 11:00 am oh my god, now that i’ve listened to both versions i’m going to run right out and have another baby. she’s adorable. comment by christina — november 25, 2005 @ 12:17 pm i think a christmas single is called for. does tadpole know any slade songs? px comment by pomgirl — november 25, 2005 @ 1:08 pm it’s snowing here in holland…so some x-mas carols would fit perfectly!!! comment by eau — november 25, 2005 @ 5:42 pm that was way to cute! my two franco-american girls are not as advanced in language as my first daughter who spoke only english. i think it slowed them down learning two languages at once but the doctor said by three bi-ling kids usually sort it all out. little bear (just turned age 3) is finally separating english and french. before she mixed the two languages in one sentence. for example: little bear mange, hungry! favorite songs in our home is this old man and row, row, row your boat. comment by pumpkin pie — november 25, 2005 @ 6:21 pm what a wonderful young lady. christmas carols next please. comment by rob — november 26, 2005 @ 4:26 pm oh, i loved hearing tadpole sing! hope to hear a mother-daughter rendition soon. elle comment by elle — november 27, 2005 @ 12:33 am am i the only one who can’t hear the files??? i press play, but then nothing happens….no fair!! comment by samantha — november 27, 2005 @ 5:16 pm bravoooooo tadpole!!! *applause* comment by kiora — november 27, 2005 @ 6:01 pm fantastic !!!!! comment by negrito — november 27, 2005 @ 6:50 pm simply adorable! comment by stash — november 27, 2005 @ 7:12 pm samantha – crank the volume up as they are quite soft… otherwise, i don’t know why that would be… sorry, you are the only one. comment by petite — november 27, 2005 @ 9:55 pm weblog awards link i’m going to put you in for eu blog !!! you should let everybody know about this !!! comment by alaska — november 28, 2005 @ 6:17 am oh my god that is the cutest thing ever!! comment by sarah — november 28, 2005 @ 8:43 pm i need to get a toddler to get more comments on my blog(-; comment by jez — november 28, 2005 @ 10:01 pm btw, unlike a previous commentator i could hear no trace of foreign accent on either version. she’s a proper little bi-lingo lassie! comment by jez — november 28, 2005 @ 10:11 pm i finally figured out what tadpole was singing, it tooks sometime to get through her french (i don’t have a trained ear), but i thought it was interesting her version was about candy…more of a moral story than the “american” version. cute all the same. :) comment by fixed up girl — november 29, 2005 @ 6:52 am so how hard was it to use audioblog.com? the result is quite good and works nicely in your page. you mentioned above that it “took you a long time” and i’m curious as to the issues. thanks! comment by gary — november 30, 2005 @ 7:50 pm brilliant. my maia (2) loves that song the best and pleads every night as i tuck her in “how i wonder”. i will play her your v.o. comment by roger — december 1, 2005 @ 12:22 am now that was just the cutest ever!! just adorable. :0) comment by medina — december 1, 2005 @ 12:42 am rss feed for comments on this post. sorry, the comment form is closed at this time. search for: about books press fbk potted petite prologue burned null and void part time mummy baggage singing in tongues eleven days later semi-detached suspendered sunday archives january 2011 november 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 february 2009 january 2009 december 2008 november 2008 october 2008 september 2008 august 2008 july 2008 june 2008 may 2008 april 2008 march 2008 february 2008 january 2008 december 2007 november 2007 october 2007 september 2007 august 2007 july 2007 june 2007 may 2007 april 2007 march 2007 february 2007 january 2007 december 2006 november 2006 october 2006 september 2006 august 2006 july 2006 june 2006 may 2006 april 2006 march 2006 february 2006 january 2006 december 2005 november 2005 october 2005 september 2005 august 2005 july 2005 june 2005 may 2005 april 2005 march 2005 february 2005 january 2005 december 2004 november 2004 october 2004 september 2004 august 2004 july 2004 categories adoption book stuff city of light french touch good time girl knocked up knot tying miam mills & boon misc missing blighty navel gazing on the road parting ways single life tadpole rearing tadpole says tadpole sings uncategorized working girl stats 638 posts 27,981 comments © catherine sanderson 2004-2009 blog at wordpress.com.
