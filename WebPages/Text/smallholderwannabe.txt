smallholderwannabe this blog is mainly a rambling kind of diary of the transition from smallholderwannabe to smallholder. saturday, march 21, 2020 strange times - week 1 we, like everybody else, are trying to keep away from other people. it feels really strange because we lead really busy lives with the church and suddenly not seeing people is just weird. and no coffeeshop to cook for, do shopping for etc. i am going to have to do some cleaning and housekeeping because i have no excuse not to : ) we (and others) are trying to sort church out. most of the congregation have computers so we will have a service on /sunday morning which we will follow along on the computer. some of the oldest folk won't be able to join in but it is the best we can do right now. and of course there are the finances. sunday giving will drop a lot but there are still salaries to be paid etc...… hum...…. like many people, i have quite a good stock of things in the house but we may have some quite creative meals because i can see now that there are a few gaps in my stocks. we'll cope, though : ) i have always bought things when they are on a really good offer and stashed a few extra away. but if things did not come up on offer, or at least, not for a long time, that is when the gaps happened. i called in to lidl yesterday, my first time in a shop in over a week and the shelves were not as empty as i had expected. of course, they had none of the things i wanted, just the things that i would not have bought anyway..... my grandchildren are all gutted. their parents are key workers so they will have to go to school when all their friends are off. i suspect that they will really enjoy it once they get used to some of the differences. five months is a long time to fill. not all parents are able to help their kids learn at home. i saw one parent of a primary schooler on the news looking at the sheet of work and saying "phonics? what are phonics?" hum..... labels: church

story of his life every year back when i was in primary school but we did not do anything much else to celebrate even then. i have just had a load of st patrick's day recipes pop up on the computer but they are all very american (and very green coloured) and nothing at all like we would have had back home. we would not even have known what some of the ingredients were let alone where to buy them so the recipes made me smile. but i am happy for people to celebrate how they like. with all this corona virus stuff going on, there is little enough to celebrate so enjoy anything you can find to celebrate : ) posted by jo @ 7:28 am 2 comments monday, march 02, 2020 time is marching on here we are in march already. hopefully some of those march winds will dry up the ground a little because my hens are not happy hens at the moment. the runs are just waterlogged and the poor little things are just paddling. ducks are happy with their feet in water but hens are not. we have put down what wood chips we have and all the leaves that we had gathered up in the autumn in an effort to have their feet up out of the water as much as we can but it is not working because there has just been too much rain. we have been to a funeral today for a work colleague who taught history for 50 (!) years at the school we worked at. he was a lovely chap and i remember him fondly. there were about 400+ people at the funeral so you can tell that he touched a lot of lives. i think we have reached the age now where we go to more funerals than we used to. i was thinking last year that i need to have a couple of "funeral-going" outfits so that i don't wear the same thing to every funeral. with church and being in the worship group, we are often called upon to provide music for funerals. so every time i go into a charity shop, i have got my eye open for something funereal as well as everyday stuff. so far i have one outfit of trousers, top and soft jacket with a second top to ring the changes a little bit. another jacket type thing would be good so i need to keep looking. labels: hens posted by jo @ 1:39 pm 3 comments tuesday, february 25, 2020 back again well, here we are again back from another trip to cambridge for my husband's business meetings. it was the first longer journey in the new car and it did fine. on the last day, i had to leave the hotel room by noon. all our possessions were on view in the car so i didn't want to leave it and go somewhere warmer. i couldn't cope with the thought of them somebody breaking in just in case anything was valuable. nothing was but i don't want to have to cope with any insurance company again for a very long time, if ever. i had several sheets of puzzles to do to keep me occupied but i was absolutely stiff with cold by the time my husband appeared. i really missed the blanket that i kept in the car that was stolen last month. my friend has a load of samples that she has done of patchwork patterns from the class she goes to. she says that she has far too many of them so will join some together into a quilt with a fleece backing that i can keep in the car so that i won't freeze in future. how lovely! this rain has not let up for very long at any one time. i wish we could have a little rest from it. my cream coloured hens and my white hens are unbelievably brown with mud. the brown hens are muddy too but it is just a little less obvious. the runs are just liquid mud that they are wading through because the heavy clay soil just cannot drain because the water table is so high. we have used up all the leaves that we gathered up in the autumn to put in their runs to keep their poor little feet a bit more out of the mud. i am playing grabbyword (fun word game) with a lady in australia who is not very far from the bush fires. she was so pleased last week because they actually had 15 minutes of rain...….. labels: hens posted by jo @ 6:42 am 0 comments thursday, february 13, 2020 hens i haven't posted about my feathered friends recently. i have lost one and gained four so i have 19 at the moment. my youngest are the 6 amberlinks and they took forever to start laying but are now laying reliably although there is rarely one from each of them in a day. i got them at the end of september 2019 at supposedly 16 weeks old but they did not start laying until christmas. these type of hens start laying at 18 - 23 weeks... usually they take it in turns to have a day off. the next oldest are 2 1/2 years old and white. there were five of them but i lost some and was down to two. my farmer friend was about to despatch his remaining four white ones but gave them to me because they were still laying some in the winter and i was having trouble supplying my couple of regular customers. his white hens and mine were raised by him from day old chicks so i was happy that they decided that they could all live together in one house and run again. that makes my life easier because i didn't want another hen house in the garden. of course, when they came to live with us, that was the impetus needed for the young amberlinks to start laying so the extra white ones were not really needed... and then there are the 3 1/2 year old brown warren types that have come back into laying after moulting late so i have gone from hardly any eggs to loads very quickly as they all decided that spring started at the end of january due to the mild winter. i have two more hens, both old girls now. one is the remaining survivor of the previous warren type flock and must be about five now. as she thinks it is spring, she is laying an egg every day but i don't suppose there will be many at all laid after easter. and then there is chicken nugget who was hatched in school in our very first hatching in june 2011. she laid two eggs a week all through last summer but has not laid any this year yet. she is a buff orpington so lays fewer eggs in a year than the other types of hen that i have but is expected to live longer. she is my pet and will follow me around the garden and i am very fond of her. i will be sad when she goes. labels: hens posted by jo @ 3:18 am 0 comments wednesday, february 12, 2020 new beginnings so this week is the start of the rest of our lives post car trauma. thank goodness! i have even slept the last two nights. mind you, the can't-eat-my-dinner thing was good for my waistline. so my oldest granddaughter, now 22, is trying to work out how she can get herself on the property ladder. she reckons that if she can get a toe on the ladder now, then that will be of benefit later. she has been saving hard and has some deposit ready. she can't afford a regular estate agent listing but wondered if she could buy something at auction. i am worried that she is looking at the guide price rather than thinking about how much the house might actually go for. also, nobody in the family has any experience of buying at auction and it seems quite a complicated process to me, being completely uninitiated. i checked that she realises the whole long list of bills that she would have to pay as a homeowner - community charge, water rates, gas, electricity, insurance. she has everything on a spreadsheet and reckons she can cover everything as well as eat and clothe herself, run her car and have a bit over for herself. she is very determined! i can well remember us buying our first house. we were very green! she is far more with it than we were. we will have to see what happens. labels: family posted by jo @ 2:44 am 2 comments friday, february 07, 2020 further update so the recovery firm told us that the car was not obviously damaged and we started the process of trying to buy it back. we liked the car and it was exactly what we wanted and we had spent a lot of time researching different cars to find it. however the insurance company had sold the car to a salvage company. after many attempts, we got the phone number of the salvage company and phoned them as we were hoping to go and have a look at the car. they told us the car was badly damaged on one side so we gave up and yesterday bought the car we had put the deposit on. no idea who was telling the truth. the man from the insurance company was going to inspect the car and tell us a buy-back price last tuesday, then wednesday, then friday, then next monday. we have had to give back the courtesy car so we no longer had a vehicle to use to go and inspect our old car. and we need a vehicle to use next tuesday for something we are doing. so we gave up and bought the other car. it is similar to our old one but older and more expensive and definitely more than the insurance company gave us for our old one. i have left out the daily hassles of phone calls and/or letters with the insurance company, the sleepless nights, the evenings when i was too fraught to eat my dinner etc etc. remind me why we have insurance please! labels: car posted by jo @ 2:27 pm 0 comments about me name: jo location: west midlands,
