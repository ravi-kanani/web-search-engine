but once i select the province it was easier to read). the site directs me to enter the numbered code and it tracks where dinner came from! it‚Äôs really interesting to see where the fish was caught, the fisherman who caught it, how it was caught and the company who processed it. how great is that? i shared it on twitter and others were able to see where my dinner was arriving from (both the salmon and halibut we had were from bc). since trying it we now keep it stocked in the freezer for easy, quick meals (you can find salmon and fish recipes on a little bit of foodsense). win! sobeys is generously giving readers a chance to win a $30 gift card so you can try them too! to enter, simply leave a comment below and let me know where you go to find local food. the market?

because i already had those burgers in our freezer ‚Äì we have been fans of them all summer. what was even better was that sobeys was offering my readers a gift card too! (more on that later). we try to limit the amount of frozen and prepackaged food we buy, so when we found the compliments wild pacific salmon burgers at the store, we both agreed that we could enjoy them with less guilt than some other products. one of the biggest sellers? each burger contains only 280 mg of sodium. very uncommon in package food! so this summer had a typical go-to meal thanks to these burgers. we would make our own tarter sauce and use multigrain or whole wheat buns. they were great on the bbq or on the grill. sobeys is our weekly grocery store of choice with a great line of compliments products (although i will be happy when they expand their organics products and offerings even more!). but these compliments wild pacific salmon burgers will be well enjoyed, even in the winter. for more information and to keep up with the latest from sobeys, like them on facebook! win! sobeys is giving away a $25 gift card to one of my lucky winners. to enter, leave a comment below and tell me what was your favourite kind of burger you had this summer. rules: 1-one entry per person 2-entry open to canadian residents, except quebec 3-contest closes monday, september 19 at 9 pm est disclosure: i was given a sobeys gift card to try some of their products, however, comments reflect my own opinion. and we love sobeys üòâ facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube grab a coffee and join me! welcome to a little bit of momsense! my name is rebecca and i'm chatting about parenting, family friendly activities, yummy recipes, family travel, and living a life full of love and laughter. thanks for stopping by! fabulous advertisers, friends and affiliates for content tips and support ‚Äì subscribe! use code momsense10 to save 20% this error message is only visible to wordpress admins error: the account for needs to be reconnected. due to recent instagram platform changes this instagram account needs to be reconnected in order to continue updating. reconnect on plugin settings page visit rebecca's profile on pinterest. tags activities activities with kids activity around ottawa baseball birthdays blogging centrepointe theatres children christmas disney junior family family activities family time family travel food gift guide giveaway halloween holidays home kids kraft canada learning march break mothers day netflix ottawa ottawa events parenting pei pinterest play preschool activity recipe recipes school shopping sobeys summer tag along toys terra20 thanksgiving theatre travel archives archives select month march 2020 february 2020 january 2020 december 2019 november 2019 october 2019 september 2019 august 2019 july 2019 june 2019 may 2019 april 2019 march 2019 february 2019 january 2019 december 2018 november 2018 october 2018 september 2018 july 2018 june 2018 may 2018 april 2018 march 2018 february 2018 january 2018 december 2017 november 2017 october 2017 september 2017 august 2017 july 2017 june 2017 may 2017 april 2017 march 2017 february 2017 january 2017 december 2016 november 2016 october 2016 september 2016 august 2016 july 2016 june 2016 may 2016 april 2016 march 2016 february 2016 january 2016 december 2015 november 2015 october 2015 september 2015 august 2015 july 2015 june 2015 may 2015 april 2015 march 2015 february 2015 january 2015 december 2014 november 2014 october 2014 september 2014 august 2014 july 2014 june 2014 may 2014 april 2014 march 2014 february 2014 january 2014 december 2013 november 2013 october 2013 september 2013 august 2013 july 2013 june 2013 may 2013 april 2013 march 2013 february 2013 january 2013 december 2012 november 2012 october 2012 september 2012 august 2012 july 2012 june 2012 may 2012 april 2012 march 2012 february 2012 january 2012 december 2011 november 2011 october 2011 september 2011 august 2011 july 2011 june 2011 may 2011 april 2011 march 2011 february 2011 january 2011 december 2010 november 2010 october 2010 september 2010 august 2010 july 2010 june 2010 may 2010 april 2010 march 2010 february 2010 january 2010 december 2009 november 2009 october 2009 september 2009 august 2009 july 2009 june 2009 may 2009 april 2009 march 2009 missed a post? making a greener difference with these easy changes (plus enter to win!) activity: make and design a hotel! activities for kids: subjective art a fun scavenger hunt game for the kids (with printable!) playing with cardboard ‚Äì don‚Äôt recycle those boxes yet! get-moving activity: movement stations for kids 8 carry-on items to travel with: what i bring to travel family travel: hotel tips for travelling with children walt disney world planning tips: family travel ottawa giveaway: enter to win 4 tickets at meridian theatres facebook twitter pinterest instagram youtube we use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website for personalization, advertising and to analyze usage. by using this site, you agree to this.continuewant more info? read our privacy policy.
