(show them the board with candy on it.) but in order to get each bit of ‘gold’, you have to work together. start with this first card. put your brains to work, and when you figure out the answer–as a group–let me know. every time you answer a riddle correctly, you earn the candy on that number. simple. so fun. but the minute there’s an unkind word, snicker, or anything of the sort, the candy’s wiped away from whichever number you’re working on. get it? good. ready? go! that’s, at least, what i plan to do while the kids are enjoying lucky charms in green milk. and we’ll see how it goes. i anticipate that we’ll start it before school and it will be waiting for the kids when they return from school. because i didn’t want them doing this all day long, i only made eight brain teaser cards with the idea that they’ll start working on it together and then if and when they get stuck on one, they can ‘pass’ and i’ll give them the next card–of course though they won’t collect that card’s candy. if it takes a few days, it takes a few days. . . if you’d like to grab the st. patrick’s day brain teaser scavenger hunt, here you are: the more that we can get our kids to use those brains, stretching the way they think about things and problem-solve, the better. what are you doing for st. patrick’s day?
