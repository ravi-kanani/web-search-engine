there are many options across the city, but choosing something that fits your location, budget and your child’s interest may feel overwhelming. the city of ottawa and the arts centres like the shenkman arts centre and the nepean creative arts centre, offer unique and exciting camp programming all summer long. to help get you started, i’m sharing 7 camps that caught my eye that i think kids will be happy to attend! although not included in my list, i want to mention that not all camps are full days, so if you want to send your kiddo for only a half day because they aren’t ready for full time or you aren’t looking for full day care, you do have options! also, there are so many options for basically every sport, art and activity you can imagine. i decided to focus on ones that are so unique and some that absolutely shocked me that they even exist (making them seem even more fun!) all camps can be discovered in this guide. i didn’t want to link to specific weeks because each camp may be offered at different locations and different weeks. summer camps for kids in ottawa camp scooter adventure my kids are obsessed with their scooters (and i don’t blame them, they are a lot of fun!) so a scootering camp where kids can learn awesome tricks and moves (plus get in a lot of exercise?) it sounds pretty great. board and table top gaming camp the kids get to make their own board games, from concept to actual creation and then play it! musical theatre camp time to put all of their love for live action plays or disney movies to the test while they learn choreography, singing and more. director’s cut: i wanna rock your kids will act in and create music videos. i think all of us did this in our basements when we were preteens didn’t we? i love this twist on traditional movie making and filming. camping 101 yes, there is a camp about outdoor camping. if you have been itching to use a trailer or book a camp site, have your kids learn the skills they need before you go! fortnite camp this camp isn’t what you are expecting. while it’s themed around the very popular online game, it’s actually fortnite themed offline. kids will learn how to create shelters and have a nerf-gun battle! i love when we can take games and their online interests offline in unique ways. zombie adventure your creative kids will love immersing themselves into the role play adventure of zombie camp. they’ll need to learn how to survive as researchers and members of a special ops team, while developing surviving skills and defense systems with nerf guns and archery. rebecca 2 min read july 3, 2018 3 replies summer guilt (and the plan to ditch it) parenting it’s no secret that i love summer vacation. i love that andy is home with us, that the kids are off, that even though i am still working, i get to balance that with extra time in the backyard, travelling to fun destinations with the people i love the most, and sleeping in. summer, somehow, also comes with a side of mom guilt. let’s make this perfectly clear – i think mom/dad guilt sucks. i know logically we shouldn’t give in to those feelings, but it happens. i’m aware of it, but i do want to change it. there are some days when, admittedly, we are the laziest bunch who ever lazied. there are way too many video games, way too much tv time, each of us kind of exist in our own little quiet bubbles. in those moments, i don’t make plans, i don’t have something exciting to do with the kids, sometimes, on these days, we only come together to eat, even though we are all in the same house. then the guilt sets in. but here’s the funny thing. those days are also some of our favourites. we travel a lot in the summer, and we check out museums, and local restaurants, and we spend so much time at various parks and splash pads. so there are plenty of days when we have full activities planned and family bonding happens. the quiet days become just as cherished. these moments of relaxation are so needed. we don’t like to be overscheduled and busy for the sake of busy. there are many days in the summer where it’s go go go but that’s why the quiet days become so important. so i’m working on ditching the guilt. because it doesn’t do anyone any good. and when the guilt creeps in, it usually means i’m nagging everyone to get off screens, or do something together, or try a new activity, even though we are perfectly content with the downtime. because those moments are needed. as a family, and as individuals. there are many days where our family is enjoying a ‘camp mom and dad’ experience. i’m going to start embracing all of our days together, and work on pushing the guilt aside. let’s enjoy the lazy days of summer! who’s with me? ps: are you working at home with the kids around this summer? here are some of my tips to make it a bit easier. the way i schedule my day has to change during the summer, but deadlines still get met! rebecca 1 min read july 16, 2017 no reply summer downtime with netflix entertainment providing kids with lots of downtime is the key to a perfect summer! with the summer here, there’s no denying that our schedules are a mix of amazing summer fun and lazy summer days. this is the kind of balance we strive for. when we are at home and not hitting the road on an adventure or visiting a local park with friends or family, our routine is a simple affair. pjs are often left on for a good chunk of the day (if they are changed out of at all), and the kids have a variety of favourite activities that they like to spend time doing. my daughter loves to create art pieces and draw. my son likes to make comic strips. they like to read, and of course they love to play video games. some days have too much screen time, but that’s all part of the summer. netflix is perfect for downtime. both my kids turn to it when they just want to chill out. my son is still obsessed with the older 90s spider-man cartoon (and i’ve only been seeing a resurgence in his watching thanks to the new movie spider-man: homecoming movie that was amazing!) and my daughter was excited to learn that just in time for the summer is the croods. there is definitely something for everyone when they turn on netflix – especially when they want those few wind-down moments. it’s no different than when i put on a show after they go to bed. what are your kids watching right now on netflix?
