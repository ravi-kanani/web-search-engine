my kiddos have always loved playing with the plastic tools and accessories that accompanied our little play workbench, so when i was stuck at the hardware store a few days ago, i couldn't resist grabbing a few bucks' worth of nuts, bolts, washers, and other fun silvery-shiny things to bring back for maddy, owen, and cora.i'm always on the lookout for ways of honing the fine motor skills of my little ones, and i know they love to play with anything that is usually off-limits, like cell phones, … read more... super-supreme saturday we are incredibly lucky to have an awesome hook-up at the supreme court this year (no joke), so today we got a behind-the-scenes tour of one of our nation's most important buildings.we ate candy in one of the justice's offices. we looked down the secret spiral staircase. we shot baskets in the upstairs gym. we sat in the courtroom. we ran around the library--only because no one else was there. and maddy, owen, and cora would have drained a hard-working justice's water cooler had we let … read more... new for us friday–mango mania as we were grocery shopping last friday before our big guppy gala night, maddy said, hey, mommy!
