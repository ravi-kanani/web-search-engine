tips for a stress free event food and drink, lifestyle *feature photo credit @sara mcconnell photography each year, for almost as long as i can remember being in our house, we have hosted thanksgiving. sometimes itâ€™s been with andyâ€™s family, other times (most of the time) with mine. not all of my siblings can always make it, depending on their spouseâ€™s family events or work commitments, but either way, i have a turkey with all the trimmings and as many family members as possible show up (and we make our maple syrup cream pie!) i love hosting, in all honesty. i like that the kids have their games and toys and space to play in. i love cooking in my kitchen, and there is always something special about people you love sitting around your table with plates full of food laughing and chatting (loudly, as is the case in my family.) if you are hosting #thanksgiving dinner, read these tips on how to help make it stress free via @bitofmomsense click to tweet i get it, hosting can be stressful. over the years iâ€™ve learned a few tips and tricks to help make things run a little more smoothly because being a hostess should also mean that you get to sit back and relax and join in the fun too! how to host thanksgiving dinner without the stress tip 1: the time you plan to eat is important if young children are around if you are already a parent, you likely donâ€™t need this tip, but it doesnâ€™t hurt to remind ourselves of this, especially as our children get older, but, the time that kids sit down for dinner is critical. a 7 pm meal time for my kids, especially when they were younger, would have spelled instant disaster and stress. instead, our family opts for an earlier food time. thereâ€™s not rush to get out, sleepy kiddos find a place to sleep, but ensuring full bellies is best for happy, extended visits. tip 2: make sure that turkey is cooked â€“ earlier is better make sure that turkey is going to be cooked earlier, rather than later. if the bird is ready at 4 pm but you arenâ€™t going to sit until 5, itâ€™s okay! however, if you plan to eat at 5 oâ€™clock and end up watching that thermometer because itâ€™s taking longer, the stress levels will rise! tip 3: cook ahead what you can thereâ€™s always something that can be made the day before, or morning of. in our case, my husband makes his coleslaw ahead of time, and we prepare the mashed turnips the morning of and switch them to a slow cooker when we want to get them warm and ready to serve. this saves us a lot of stress! tip 4: potluck sure, i canâ€™t outsource the turkey (okay, maybe i can, but i love the smell of the turkey in my oven!) but thereâ€™s always something else iâ€™m happy to have someone else to do â€“ and my guests always offer. my dadâ€™s stuffing canâ€™t be beat so none of us want to even attempt it and he covers that. my sister and parents are bringing dessert this year so i only have to focus on the main course! tip 5: the dishes can wait this tip wonâ€™t be accepted by some people. i understand. staring at a counter full of dishes can be stressful. enlist the team of guests to help load, wash and dry dishes if you prefer. however, in our case, we like to sit back with a glass of wine and relax, so we rinse what dishes need to be done right away, put food in the fridge and stack piles of plates off to the side. the dishwasher can go on later in the evening (or first thing in the morning, depending on how festive everyone is feeling). tip 6: byoc (bring your own containers) this is the rule in our family that if you want left overs, you bring your own container. this doesnâ€™t always happen, and we see each other often enough that we swap dishes with great frequency, but ideally, we show up with containers. the joke is usually who brings a big one, or who is smart enough to bring separate containers for dinner food and dessert. this plan works though, because we always send people home with something, and by having containers ready, i donâ€™t have to rummage through my good ones to part with them. no matter who you host this weekend, remember to relax and enjoy it! the people you surround yourself with are thankful you are hosting and want to see you too ðŸ˜‰ have any tips to share yourself? drop them in the comments! rebecca 1 min read october 10, 2017 no reply thankfulness parenting it was a busy weekend. full of family, food and fun. i meant to write this post yesterday, on actual thanksgiving, but the day ran away from me, as all good days should. we hosted our big meal with many kids and adults around the table laughing and sharing stories. the weather was warm and with the oven running all day to cook our turkey, it didnâ€™t take long for the house to warm up too. but windows were opened, the fan put on and the company distracted us. the weekend kicked off with a pd day for the kids, so friends and i took our kiddos to the pumpkin patch, a tradition we started a few years ago. then it was quiet on saturday while we prepared for company and visited with my brother who was in from out of town, and sunday and monday was filled with ongoing playtime and food. it doesnâ€™t take long in these moments for me to reflect on how thankful i am. for the friends who are a part of my village. for my family who always makes me laugh, and for my own mini-unit; andy and the kids. they are my constants, no matter who busy or overwhelmed things may get. i had a wonderful long weekend, reminiscent of our time spent together this summer, a taste of those old schedules with late nights and extra coffee. but our time together canâ€™t be beat, and i wouldnâ€™t trade it for anything. this year i was thankful for that bounty â€“ of food, of love and of time. i hope you had a lovely thanksgiving weekend too. rebecca 1 min read october 11, 2016 no reply thankful parenting it doesnâ€™t take much to remind me of all the things in life i have to be thankful for. we enjoyed our thanksgiving long weekend by kicking it off with some fun outdoor time at the pumpkin patch with friends, followed by hosting our family thanksgiving dinner and then relaxing as a family the rest of the weekend. we took a walk outside, we played, and i read a book while snuggled on the couch. pie!!!! #pie #baking a photo posted by rebecca s (@bitofmomsense) on oct 8, 2016 at 6:02am pdt see this spot?
