tire repair kit much more than the cheap plastic version my car tire had a dry-wall screw in it. i bought a cheap tire plug repair kit at the local pep boys for about $12. it was hard to use because i had to apply a lot of force to the plastic handle and it was painful. a month later i found another screw in my tire. i left the screw in until i ordered a heavy duty tire plug repair kit on amazon. the all metal handles were a pleasure to use. since then i've used it a couple more times and the tires have not started leaking again read the rest share / tweet / 18 comments useful stuff mark

sharpest media theorists and cultural critics i know. it's always a thrill to have a conversation with him because he makes me question my opinions and i alway end up with a changed brain. so it was

age. his twenty books include the just-published team human, based on his podcast, as well as the bestsellers present shock, throwing rocks at the google bus, program or be programmed, life inc., and

cool tools show on itunes | rss | transcript | see all the cool tools show posts on a single page show notes: written language written language is definitely a tool. it's a medium. it's an environment. there's all these ways to think about it, but i love thinking about words as a tool. because particularly, when i'm mad about something or i feel like there's something that people don't get, once i can put words around it, once i can articulate what's happening, what people are feeling, or the dysfunction, or the paradox, i feel like it empowers me and so many other people to then go do something about it. read the rest share / tweet / 1 comments cool tools / douglas rushkoff / useful stuff mark frauenfelder / 12:27 pm thu, jan 30, 2020 beloved metal-body rotring 600 mechanical
