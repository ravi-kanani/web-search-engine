(last year, queensland, australia also began offering emoji on plates.) the vermont bill doesn't specify which emoji will be included as choices. from the short form description of bill h.866: this bill proposes to create a new special registration plate with the choice of one of six emojis in addition to the distinctive number assigned by the commissioner of motor vehicles or the numerals and letters selected by the registered owner of a vehicle as a vanity plate.

"according to protocols, we search every vehicle we have received and this case was no exception. however, we couldn't find anything at the time, perhaps because the pills had been well hidden," said niyom termsrisuk, secretary general of the office of the narcotics control board (oncb), according to the bangkok post. image for illustration only: "ritalin" by sponge (cc by-sa 3.0) read the rest share / tweet / 12 comments auctions / drugs / police / vehicles david pescovitz / 4:01 pm wed, jan 1, 2020 watch this truck fall through an icy lake and completely vanish a gentleman attempted to drive his pickup truck across the iced over big shag lake in marquette county, michigan. unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. from the mining journal: crossroads truck repair and the (michigan department of natural resources) assessed the scene and advised the driver that they have 72 hours from when the incident occurred to pay to have their vehicle removed from the lake... the michigan department of environment, great lakes and energy will evaluate the lake after the vehicle’s removal for any fluid cleanup. read the rest share / tweet / 19 comments accidents / ooops / vehicles david pescovitz / 10:20 am fri, dec 27, 2019 evidence that a car isn't a pedestrian and probably shouldn't use the pedestrian lane yesterday in new york, police spent hours attempting to remove this honda from the pedestrian lane of the pulaski bridge connecting brooklyn and queens. apparently, it was a stolen car and the driver likely escaped through a window.
