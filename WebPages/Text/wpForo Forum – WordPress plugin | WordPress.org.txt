modern and vey simple to use accrypt march 11, 2020 we've been waiting for a long time to move to wordpress from our bulletin board. we've tested bbpress, buddypress and other forum plugins but neither of them couldn't come even close to our needs. so i'd like to thank you guys for such a powerfull forum plugin. finaly we are able to create a nice and modern forum community with user membership and blogging on wordpress. you did a great job making a bulleting board so easy to use but keeping all neccessary features. i'm going to open a separate topic and ask you for some more
