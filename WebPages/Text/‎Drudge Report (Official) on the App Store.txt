i can see the entire drudge page on the browser version and quickly scan the whole page and zoom in to show as little or as much as my heart desires. the app, however, pre-selects a font size that you cannot adjust, feeds you headlines that (because of the font size) run into extra line spacing reducing total headlines available. it’s a very inefficient way to view the news, like being fed m&m’s by the piece when what i want is a handful. and not having that option is not preferable to the browser. it’s an issue if time, space, control, and efficiency. just my take. i’d use it if they could give me controls over all of that. the only benefit i see is getting alerts, but then again, just who decides it’s worthwhile or rises to the level of sending a notice to my phone makes it all questionable. reach449 , 03/20/2020 a fearmonger i have used the drudge report for years for my news. no more! since covaid-19 drudge finds every story he possibly can that produces fear in americans and dis-trust in our government. of course i don’t believe everything the government tells us, but drudge has taken it to new levels. big bold and red headlines every day how our country is falling apart over this and how our government is irresponsible and a failure. just today a promising new treatment and possibly a cure was announced by the president; not one story of this in drudge! he is too busy pointing readers to bad news. he has become a sensationalist, just another website seeking clicks, with no concern with balanced reporting. might as well read the national enquirer. shame on you, drudge. look what you have become; once a very trusted news source to just another rag. bye for good...one less click for you. american primitive , 10/21/2019 would love to give 5 stars... but a once great and indispensable application has lost its way for a long time from over design. nobody wants to use an application that is worse than a browser based solution. here is a review from 2014 when the slide started: this was a quirky but functional app until late mid to late 2014 when it began to receive a rewrite. now all of its features are gone, there are no configuration options and it is slower and more difficult to navigate than the drudge repot website itself. why why why? i am now saying goodbye to a product which ranked among my used apps. it was quirky, it was annoying, but it beat the heck out of using safari on an iphone. it no longer does and i now see no value add whatsoever to this app. below was a review from the good old days when the app was very odd, but still functional: but this application does not respect iphone inactivity and shutoff options. don't see a way to fix this in the numerous settings. if there is one it is under a misleading name. also there are many blank page issues which come and go with each release. information seller siren tech, llc size 47.6 mb category news compatibility requires ios 8.0 or later. compatible with iphone 5s, iphone 6, iphone 6 plus, iphone 6s, iphone 6s plus, iphone se, iphone 7, iphone 7 plus, iphone 8, iphone 8 plus, iphone x, iphone xs, iphone xs max, iphone xr, iphone 11, iphone 11 pro, iphone 11 pro max, ipad air, ipad air wi‑fi + cellular, ipad mini 2, ipad mini 2 wi‑fi + cellular, ipad air 2, ipad air 2 wi‑fi + cellular, ipad mini 3, ipad mini 3 wi‑fi + cellular, ipad mini 4, ipad mini 4 wi‑fi + cellular, ipad pro (12.9‑inch), ipad pro (12.9‑inch) wi-fi + cellular, ipad pro (9.7‑inch), ipad pro (9.7‑inch) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad (5th generation), ipad (5th generation) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad pro (12.9‑inch) (2nd generation), ipad pro (12.9‑inch) (2nd generation) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad pro (10.5‑inch), ipad pro (10.5‑inch) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad (6th generation), ipad wi‑fi + cellular (6th generation), ipad pro (11‑inch), ipad pro (11‑inch) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad pro (12.9‑inch) (3rd generation), ipad pro (12.9‑inch) (3rd generation) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad mini (5th generation), ipad mini (5th generation) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad air (3rd generation), ipad air (3rd generation) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad (7th generation), ipad (7th generation) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad pro (11‑inch) (2nd generation), ipad pro (11‑inch) (2nd generation) wi‑fi + cellular, ipad pro (12.9‑inch) (4th generation), ipad pro (12.9‑inch) (4th generation) wi‑fi + cellular, ipod touch (6th generation), and ipod touch (7th generation). languages age rating 17+ unrestricted web access copyright © 2010-2020 drudge report archives price free app support privacy policy app support privacy policy supports family sharing with family sharing set up, up to six family members can use this app. you may also like see all the daily caller news rush limbaugh news breitbart news newsmax tv & web news headlines plus news blazetv: pro-america news more ways to shop: find an apple store or other retailer near you. or call 1-800-my-apple. choose your country or region copyright © 2020 apple inc. all rights reserved. privacy policy terms of use sales and refunds legal site map
