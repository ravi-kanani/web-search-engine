internet› social media & user-generated content instagram accounts with the most followers worldwide 2020 published by j. clement, mar 27, 2020 footballer cristiano ronaldo heads the ranking of the most popular instagram accounts. he is the most-followed person on the photo sharing app platform with over 209 million followers. instagram's own account was ranked first with almost 340 million followers. instagram is a photo-sharing social networking service that enables users to take pictures and edit them with filters. the platform allows users to post and share their images online and directly with their friends and followers on the social network. as of june 2018, the cross-platform app reported more than 1 billion monthly active users. currently, there are almost 105 million instagram users in the united states and experts project this figure to surpass 130 million users in 2022. instagram audiences are predominantly young – recent u.s. data states that half of instagram users are aged 34 years or younger. spring 2018 data reveals that instagram is also one of the second-most important social networks of teenage internet users and one of the most-visited social networks among teenagers in the united states. brands are keen to reach instagram audiences as users of the social network show high engagement rates with the displayed content. sports content such as nba and nfl, as well as sporting sites bleacher report and barstool sports have highly engaged audiences on the platform and it is not uncommon for athletes to generate additional income with social media advertising. unsurprisingly, ronaldo ranks first again, as the average media value of one of his instagram posts is 735,386 u.s. dollars. read more instagram accounts with the most followers
