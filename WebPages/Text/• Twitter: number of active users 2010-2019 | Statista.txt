internet› social media & user-generated content twitter: number of monthly active users 2010-2019 published by j. clement, aug 14, 2019 how many people use twitter? as of the first quarter of 2019, twitter averaged 330 million monthly active users, a decline from its all-time high of 336 mau in the first quarter of 2018. as of the first quarter of 2019, the company switched its user reporting metric to monetizable daily active users (mdau). twitter twitter is a social networking and microblogging service, enabling registered users to read and post short messages called tweets. twitter messages are limited to 280 characters and users are also able to upload photos or short videos. tweets are posted to a publicly available profile or can be sent as direct messages to other users. part of the social platform’s appeal is the ability of users to follow any other user with a public profile, enabling users to interact with celebrities who regularly post on the social media site. currently, the most-followed person on twitter is singer katy perry with more than 107 million followers. twitter has also become an important communications channel for governments and heads of state – u.s. president donald trump was the most-followed world leader on twitter, followed by pope francis and indian prime minister narendra modi. despite the widespread usage among the rich and famous, the decline in active users has not been impressing investors as the platform is largely reliant on delivering advertising to users in order to generate revenues. twitter’s company revenue in 2018 amounted to three billion u.s. dollars, up from 2.44 billion in the preceding fiscal year. twitter was only recently able to report a positive annual result for the first time, when the company generated 1.2 billion u.s. dollars in net income in 2018. read more number of monthly active twitter users worldwide from 1st quarter 2010 to 1st quarter 2019 (in millions) number of monthly active
