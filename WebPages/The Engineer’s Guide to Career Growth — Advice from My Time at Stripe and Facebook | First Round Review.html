    <p id="text_ceb7e2d3ba654cc6b410e1b1c51204c6" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayleney/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">Raylene Yung</a></strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayleney/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link"></a> likes to say that her path into engineering management was in some ways gradual, and in others, a wild ride full of challenges at every twist and turn. Her first taste of life as an engineering manager came at Facebook in 2011, on what she describes as a tiny team. “It was three people — including myself,” says Yung. “The day-to-day wasn’t all that different. I was still diving into code, but balancing that with learning how to recruit and hold 1:1s.”</p>
    <p id="text_ad95510746f0430f9cc724a0825ada44" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Then the wild ride began. Yung had to strap in as her team took on more in scope, growing from three to thirty, and beyond. “I moved on from reviewing code to owning company metrics and building teams in multiple offices,” she says. By the time Yung left Facebook in 2015, she was the youngest engineering director at a public company with over 10,000 employees — several rungs up from where she had started, as a new grad at the then 700-person startup.</p>
    <p id="text_31a995955b434782a8fe4240077706e5" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Yung then took on a challenge of a different sort when she joined Stripe. “I wanted to see if I had what it takes to be a great leader in a completely different environment,” she says. (Spoiler alert: she did.) In her nearly four years at Stripe as it scaled up from 200 to over 1500 people, Yung built the product management team, defined career growth and recruiting frameworks, ran the core Payments business, and spun up the company’s global engineering hub in Singapore.</p>
    <p id="text_86d0488ab27a4f68949c0aa688c9e034" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Taking a front-row seat on two very different startup rides left her with a clear takeaway. “<strong class="Annotation -strong">Personal growth is compounded by company growth</strong>. At Facebook, I focused on learning as much as I could from the experienced leaders who were joining as we grew. At Stripe, <em class="Annotation -emphasis">I</em> was one of those leaders, tasked with figuring it out and teaching others,” Yung says. “I had to learn from piloting new internal programs, reaching out to peers and former managers for advice, and seeking out coaching and training.”</p>
    <p id="text_7b39f749ef534336a8eb31c7e9318d53" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">She translated this crash course into a lot of heads down writing time, producing <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/scaling-eng" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">Stripe’s Atlas guide to scaling engineering teams</a>, as well as her own <a href="https://github.com/raylene/eng-handbook" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">handbook for eng teams</a> (which covers everything from 1:1s to performance reviews). After a decade of working at explosive growth startups, Yung left Stripe to take some much needed time off and carve out white space to continue sharing what she’s learned.</p>
    <p id="text_b093a3571fad49db9b6db199e32606e3" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">And she’d like to train her focus on one subject in particular: <strong class="Annotation -strong">career growth for engineers</strong>. “Most of the advice you hear is about advancing quickly, not stopping to soak up all you can,” she says. In this exclusive interview, Yung shares a collection of counterintuitive career lessons, the ones she learned the hard way. She also dives into why the IC and management tracks aren’t parallel ladders, but rather intertwined steps. Finally, she covers more specific roadblocks that can appear at every stage of your engineering career, as well as guiding questions that can serve as a gut-check as you seek to push them aside.</p>
    <p id="text_9e8bc153ed264de79dd6786324622fcd" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">With both broad lessons and targeted advice for different career phases, there’s plenty of wisdom to mine here. Whether it’s the young engineer peering around the corner to get a sense of what lies ahead or a seasoned leader trying to wrap their arms around increasingly thorny technical and managerial obstacles, Yung challenges <strong class="Annotation -strong">every engineer to ask themselves the <em class="Annotation -emphasis">right</em> questions as they plot out their careers</strong>.</p>

    <p id="text_a6d2538fa60a4b5c8ff22df5eabba4b7" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">There are some underlying themes that can carry you throughout your career — and these three lessons have been the foundation of Yung’s at every stage:</p>
    <h3 id="text_a21e167e85b24abfbccefe06ef24108f" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--heading">1. Strive to be the most valuable, but least critical.</h3>
    <p id="text_1ad8cada93224dea83a805fa86ccd958" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Most of us would probably be thrilled to be described as “critical” to a project’s success. But in Yung’s experience, that’s dangerous territory for an engineer to be in. Take this example from her time at Facebook. Yung had cemented herself as a company expert on posting permissions, but she was quickly about to discover the drawbacks of being the lynchpin.</p>
    <p id="text_237afc297ca14705946b80cc50aae9f5" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“I was training for my first marathon and had just finished a 20-mile run — only to discover that I was being paged for a live incident. I remember sitting in my bathtub fully clothed, somewhat delirious, with giant bottles of Gatorade in each hand and my laptop open, trying to figure out what had happened,” she says. “It was a high and a low point at the same time. I felt so important and needed, but all I wanted to do was rest and get out of the way. I vowed to immediately start transferring as much knowledge to my teammates as I could so they would have the tools to solve problems without me.”</p>
    <p id="text_deffea0f446c4a97b986890cf8cf2cf0" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong">While you’ve probably heard the common working adage to “manage yourself out of a job,” Yung finds that phrasing too simplistic</strong>. For her, it’s less about making yourself obsolete, and more about making yourself less critical.</p>
    <blockquote id="text_5b5f2b4cce224b9bb9ab7f0c973e2e39" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--quote">
     When you’re critical to a project, you’re playing a decisive or crucial role in the success, failure or existence of something. As leaders and engineers, we’re all in this position at some point. But you can’t stay there. 
    </blockquote>
    <p id="text_cf4b7c599c7c409095ecc9266527948b" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“When you’re valuable, you’re extremely useful or important — but not a failure point," says Yung. "The best engineers and managers are great at adding value, getting the most out of the people around them, and helping the team see around corners even when they’re not there.”</p>
    <h3 id="text_4f07a53c549b4bbdaf4863ba66752382" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--heading">2. Want to succeed as a manager? Establish an emotional equilibrium.</h3>
    <p id="text_dc49bf698b2546358c915c4becab327a" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">By now, it’s clear to most that <a href="https://firstround.com/review/this-is-what-impactful-engineering-leadership-looks-like/" class="Annotation -link">forcing engineers to move into management is a mistake</a>. The challenge for most engineers is deciding if it’s a mantle they want to take on. “Although transitions into management sometimes happen quickly, think about it deeply and prepare as best as you can. Too many engineers plunge in, without exploring lightweight ways to try the manager’s hat on first,” says Yung.</p>
    <p id="text_5561bb984bd84bcaab56af42956659b8" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“I started by taking on more team responsibilities and onboarding new hires as a Facebook bootcamp mentor. I led a large technical project and got a feel for balancing engineering work against people leadership. By the time the project launched, I knew I wanted to invest time in becoming a good manager.”</p>
    <blockquote id="text_bc6a780b40ce467dbf9da6ec2eb11b3a" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--quote">
     Management is not for the faint of heart. While being a great manager is really hard, it’s incredibly rewarding — and something I’ve chosen to spend many of my waking hours trying to get better at.
    </blockquote>
    <p id="text_73f07cdfaff7458795039737aaa28c6a" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Still, all the prep work in the world won’t ready you for the emotional challenge that lies ahead. “Most of the time, this is what I end up coaching new managers through,” says Yung. “As an IC, you don’t see the full picture of all the ups and downs managers have to deal with, so it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking you’re ready — and then freaking out once you realize you’re not.” </p>
    <p id="text_177091a2cc854d67a4848dfda0b3254d" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">To help would-be managers get a better sense of what’s to come, Yung sketches out this chart on a whiteboard to give them a visual metaphor (<a href="https://medium.com/@emdashry/modern-portfolio-theory-for-management-variance-maximization-in-engineering-7dde7269e8a4" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">which she explains in more detail here</a>):</p>

    <p id="text_7d57a24eeea64e6980fcf8f561a682b0" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“As an individual contributor, your job often looks like a local hill-climbing exercise. For most projects, you steadily make progress until you don’t. You’re either done and can move on, or maybe something went awry and your project was canceled or simply failed. Either way you get to start over from zero the next time,” says Yung.</p>
    <p id="text_79c772d44a00427cb6fd4af7def12148" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">But engineering managers <strong class="Annotation -strong">unlock the negative zone of this chart</strong>. “As an IC, I was a bit of a perfectionist. I thought in black and white, in designing systems, in exhaustively listing out all the edge cases,” she says. “As a manager, it took me a lot of time to realize you can't solve problems that way. People are not optimization problems — you have to accept there's a range of solutions and there isn't one true great answer.”</p>
    <p id="text_4f6d5db1e9ec45d5a9884209130527f7" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Another observation: <strong class="Annotation -strong">progress and feelings are no longer tightly correlated</strong>. “As an individual contributor, generally when you were doing well on a project you were making visible progress. As an engineering manager, you can work hard on something for over a year, only to see no progress in the short-term and <em class="Annotation -emphasis">maybe</em> experience a big payoff in the much longer-term,” says Yung.</p>
    <p id="text_2b3e1f51d9c843bc8e3fbe57d48cf2df" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">All of that combined can bring your emotions down in ways you can’t predict or control. “Your mood will swing wildly. The larger your teams get, the greater the probability something is going off the rails at any given time. The crests and dips grow bigger and bigger,” she says. “The first step is being aware that <a href="https://firstround.com/review/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/" class="Annotation -link">this is completely normal</a>. The second step is trying to establish more of an equilibrium so you don’t get knocked off course so easily.”</p>
    <blockquote id="text_05ec6e43b57841eab228c056094476fa" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--quote">
     Part of what makes experienced managers great is their ability to weather storms and normalize their own emotions to somewhere closer to zero.
    </blockquote>
    <p id="text_ffa056245d0b4c13b3076e73980ba54e" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Yung cautions that engineering managers are also liable to develop what she calls split-brain syndrome. “You put on a mask. To your teammates or coworkers you feel this need to maintain an even, steady zero, but on the inside you’re going through these wild swings,” she says. “Don’t make the mistake of trying to handle this on your own. Some of my closest friends and mentors from work are the people I’ve been the most vulnerable with, and who have helped me become a much better leader.”</p>
    <h3 id="text_5ccd0f01a89744fda296f99ff0811fa9" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--heading">3. Focus on growth and learning at every step — not on climbing the ladder as quickly as possible.</h3>
    <p id="text_268f41dd71874c3ebbad162e2895b827" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Even though there’s a lot of industry emphasis on ladders and levels, Yung’s no longer sure that’s the best way for engineers to think about their careers. “While companies have developed ‘parallel’ ladders between IC and engineering management tracks — and I helped with this very task at Stripe — I’ve since come to think of these engineering roles more as <strong class="Annotation -strong">progressing along a pair of joint and often intertwined steps</strong>,” she says.</p>
    <p id="text_6af78c30474e4019a228703e263259e2" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Here are those steps as Yung sees them:</p>

     Management and IC careers aren’t strictly parallel paths — in practice, they criss-cross all over the place. But it’s only possible to toggle back and forth later on in your career if you put in the work early on. Push for the manager track prematurely and your technical lead chops may not be sharp enough to pull it off.

    <p id="text_252bb041b6c24cdabb603dc9840afc9a" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">In Yung’s experience, many engineers are focused on moving up the ranks as quickly as possible, asking questions such as, “How can I become a people manager?’ or “I’ve been here for a year, what’s next?” or “How can I get more headcount on my team?” to skip ahead.</p>
    <p id="text_4750b0eb35534e7aaf9e9d237d78b78d" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“Those are all questions centered around a desire to climb that ladder even faster.

     The best career advice I have for young engineers is to focus on learning instead of worrying about tracks and career ladders. That way, no matter what path you take as an IC, domain expert, engineering manager or even PM, you’ll only get better over time.

    <p id="text_5cc0ca37b068467cba7eefdb38548722" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Many new grads (or those who came to software engineering later on) have eagerness, drive, hunger — and impatience — in spades. But that impatience can have unintentional consequences if it’s not channeled in the right direction, says Yung.</p>
    <p id="text_12342126171f4760bf724b3ec72b6143" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">In her experience, these three moves can knock early engineers off-course:</p>

Building a great foundation early on is critical in your career, no matter what function you ultimately want to end up in,” she says. “Don’t rush through the fundamentals at the beginning. There’s no real substitute for time spent with your hands on the keyboard.”</p></li>
     <li><p id="text_a98430f61c2f40ee9517f1be0b5e1a84" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"> <strong class="Annotation -strong">Moving on from a team or company too quickly:</strong> “As a hiring manager, I’m skeptical of candidates who say some variation of ‘I’ve worked at X company for over a year, and I’ve learned everything I can so it’s time to move on.’” she says. “<strong class="Annotation -strong">Sometimes the most interesting challenges only become tractable to you after a few years — you might be overlooking massive learning opportunities that come with staying in your current role</strong>. The best engineers are those who’ve taken the time to deeply understand a system or product and can apply their experience to a new problem.”</p></li>

At both Facebook and Stripe, you can interview in the language you feel most comfortable in, on the belief that if you’re a good engineer, your skills will help you pick things up as needed,” she says. “You also don’t need to over-index on the new and shiny because what’s old can become new again. For example, when the Android platform first came out, no one really knew how to be a ‘good Android developer.’ Product teams were actually bootstrapped from infrastructure Java developers who were recruited over,” she says. “As it turns out, experience with parallelism and multi-threaded applications was far more applicable to Android than the single-threaded, asynchronous request patterns being used in the main Facebook web app.”</p></li>

One of the most common pieces of practical advice I give to new grad engineers is to always review your own code before you submit it to others. Catch your own mistakes and quickly learn to not make them again.”</p></li>

He always spotted the flaw in my designs. Mark came from a product and business focused background. He spent less time on design but was an incredibly fast coder and thought through every edge case. I wanted to be as good at design and code review as Adam, and as good at product as Mark, so I vowed to get as much code reviewed as I possibly could by the former and get all my user-facing changes reviewed by the latter.”</p></li>

Not only do you need to think about maintainability now, but you need to think about what’s next. What if we need to launch in ten new countries? A hundred countries? What would break? How would your current design change? Pushing yourself to think through a wide range of scenarios helps you not only deepen your understanding of the here and now, but also helps you strategically steer into the future.”</p></li>

Work cross-functionally and think of your PMs and partners as your teammates. If you do want to become a manager later, this will help give you a much stronger sense of whether you’ll enjoy making the switch.”</p></li>

    <p id="text_0b18b3c2e6db4feb960f196c63d17bd5" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Some engineers relish the opportunity to become deep-domain experts, particularly by staying in one part of the company or technical system.

The feeling of being essential, of being needed for my expertise had masked that gap. It wasn’t until we merged with another team that was working on an entirely different approach that I felt like I was learning again. This led to a great renaissance and a complete re-invention of our entire system.”</p></li>

One rule of thumb for onboarding very experienced hires is that for every year they spent in their last role, they need one month of slow initial onboarding time; once ramped up, their impact accelerates quickly.</p></li>

Develop documentation, training programs, or reusable components and infrastructure to pass knowledge on at scale,” says Yung. “Stripe has a strong culture of information sharing and discovery, where anyone can search across shared emails and documents. But, even in such an information-rich environment, engineers who were deeply knowledgeable about a system were often less impactful than those who could also communicate about it in a usable and digestible way.”</p></li>

But there’s also the risk of pushing <em class="Annotation -emphasis">too hard</em> for results and compromising on quality and team health. “You could be working on all the right things and driving up the metrics, but your on-call rotation is on fire and causes engineers to burn out and switch teams. <strong class="Annotation -strong">The key is to invest in all aspects of your team and keep them in balance</strong> — even if some changes may seem counterproductive in the short-term, like slowing down your roadmap to invest in developer efficiency and team happiness, they’ll increase your impact over time.”</p></li>

Eventually he could stretch it to a month, and then several for paternity leave. Now he aspires to be able to go away for a full year. I suspect most companies won’t let you actually be away that long, but it’s a helpful litmus test to try for yourself. <strong class="Annotation -strong">Growing as a manager is not just about transferring knowledge, it’s also about building the right team and filling in the gaps.</strong> Maybe you have a team of folks who, given the right tasks, can plow through them faster than you expect and ask for more.

Yung’s advice? Instead of trying to work around the problem, tackle it head on. “One of my first team members had been working for twelve more years than I had — I was intimidated, but decided to try and learn from the experience,” she says. “In our first 1:1, I shared areas I thought I could help him with (e.g. product domain knowledge, company context), and asked for his help in others (e.g. managing senior engineers, scaling complex systems). Over the next few years, we developed a strong working relationship and learned a lot from one another.”</p></li>

    <p id="text_097ef151822143ee94fb221a271b214a" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“Similar to the initial transition from individual contributor to engineering manager, moving to managing multiple teams or organizations can feel like an entirely new job,” says Yung. “It becomes even easier to fall into the headcount trap, as the need for growth compounds with the number of managers on your team. On top of that, <strong class="Annotation -strong">once you start managing managers it can be tempting to spot new managers everywhere</strong>. And sometimes, you’ll be most tempted to select the reluctant, those incredible technical leaders who don’t really want to manage,” she says.</p>
    <p id="text_1b05df92fb8749bab7288559ddc12b1b" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Of course, there are “war times” when it’s all hands on deck and battlefield transitions might be necessary. But do it with care, Yung cautions. “Early at Stripe, I transitioned three engineers into management because we needed immediate support and were still spinning up our recruiting pipeline. Two of them grew to really enjoy the role; the third realized they were happiest when coding and providing technical leadership and switched back,” she says. “The key is to work closely to develop new managers — make sure they go into it with eyes wide open and have an opportunity to learn, but also give them the room to switch back. By keeping people in ill-suited management roles, you risk not only burning out some of your most productive team members, but are also preventing yourself from finding someone better.”</p>
    <blockquote id="text_dcff24567f5b488b993da238d8c720f8" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--quote">
     Too many leaders convince the reluctant to become or stay managers, drafting them into duty. This might be necessary in crunchtime, but keeping unwilling managers in roles for too long is a costly mistake.

There’s a perennial switch between horizontal, vertical, domain-specific, or user/product-specific matrixed team structures — which means org leads can often end up with a disparate set of groups under their wing. Done wrong, this can feel like whiplash, where new organizations feel arbitrarily grouped together and lack a broader purpose. “At one point at Stripe, I was leading teams that built applications using specific eng and product skills, such as frontend development, ML and understanding the SaaS business model. At first, it did feel almost like a grab bag of apps that were far from Stripe’s core business,” says Yung. “But after work and iteration, we tied the mission to two things: One, enhancing the core payments platform by building powerful features that might not be needed by every user, but were critical to those who did, and two, being the stewards of a new business model that could compound over time and be a meaningful company driver. This helped paint a more coherent vision and enabled people to explain what they were working on, both to themselves and to other teams.”</p></li>

Are they even the right teams?</em></strong><em class="Annotation -emphasis"></em> Don’t be afraid to take action if you can’t confidently answer why your teams fit together or if you’re working on the right things. “Think about bigger cross-team improvements to make. Maybe one team shouldn’t exist at all. Maybe other teams don’t have enough people for their most important projects. Enlist help from your manager, peers and other cross-functional partners to assess your teams and make changes,” says Yung. “I like to assess along the following axes: <strong class="Annotation -strong"><em class="Annotation -emphasis">people</em></strong><em class="Annotation -emphasis"></em> (Do I have the right skill sets and leaders on the team? Are teams engaged and are people getting the development and growth opportunities they need?), <strong class="Annotation -strong"><em class="Annotation -emphasis">projects and goals</em></strong><em class="Annotation -emphasis"></em> (Are we working on the highest impact things right now?

Do what you can to support each team and don’t shy away from gathering first-hand knowledge. Attend team meetings as a guest observer, do skip-level 1:1s, and communicate transparently along the way,” says Yung. <strong class="Annotation -strong">But don’t let gathering information take you too deeply into the weeds.</strong> “It’s easy to get caught in that awkward spot where you’re helping debug local team issues in lieu of making changes that help your org overall. You also might feel the impulse to step in and direct the groups that report to you. But now is when the ‘ask don’t tell’ approach is more important than ever. Look to your group leads to tell you what they need. Maximize your value by providing the external context they don’t have and contributing at a broader and higher level.”</p></li>
