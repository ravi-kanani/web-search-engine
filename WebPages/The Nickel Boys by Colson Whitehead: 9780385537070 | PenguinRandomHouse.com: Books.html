         <p class="clearfix"> <b><i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Bestseller<br></b><br><b>Winner of The Kirkus Prize</b><br><br><b>Chosen by Publishers Weekly as one of the 10 Best Books of the Year</b><br><br><b>Longlisted for The National Book Award&nbsp;</b><br><br>“<b>A necessary read</b>.”&nbsp;—President Barack Obama<br><br>“This is a powerful book by one of America’s great writers. . . . Without sentimentality, in&nbsp;<b>as intense and finely crafted a book as you’ll ever read</b>, Whitehead tells a story of American history that won’t allow you to see the country in the same way again.” —<i>Toronto Star</i><br><br>“<b>Colson Whitehead continues to make a classic American genre his own</b><i>.</i>&nbsp;. . . The narration is disciplined and the sentences plain and sturdy, oars cutting into water. Every chapter hits its marks. . . . Whitehead comports himself with gravity and care, the steward of painful, suppressed histories; his choices on the page can feel as much ethical as aesthetic. The ordinary language, the clear pane of his prose, lets the stories speak for themselves. . . . Whitehead has written novels of horror and apocalypse; nothing touches the grimness of the real stories he conveys here” —<i>The New York Times<br></i><br>“Inspired by a real school in Florida,&nbsp;<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is a haunting narrative that&nbsp;<b>reinforces Whitehead’s prowess as a leading voice in American literature.</b>” —<i>TIME<br></i><br>“[<i>The Nickel Boys</i>] should&nbsp;<b>further cement Whitehead as one of his generation’s best</b>.” —<i>Entertainment Weekly&nbsp;</i><br><br>“Were Whitehead’s only aim to shine an unforgiving light on a redacted chapter of racial terrorism in the American chronicle, that would be achievement enough. What he is doing in his new novel, as in its immediate predecessor, is more challenging than that. . . . He applies a master storyteller’s muscle. . . . The elasticity of time in&nbsp;<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;feels so organic that only when you put the book down do you fully appreciate that its sweep encompasses much of the last century as well as this one. . . .&nbsp;<b>A writer like Whitehead</b>, who challenges the complacent assumption that we even fathom what happened in our past,&nbsp;<b>has rarely seemed more essential</b>.” —<i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>“A masterpiece squared, rooted in history and American mythology and, yet, painfully topical in its visions of justice and mercy erratically denied . . . a great American novel.”&nbsp; —Maureen Corrigan, NPR.org<br><br>“Whitehead’s brilliant examination of America’s history of violence is&nbsp;<b>a stunning novel of impeccable language and startling insight</b>.”<i>&nbsp;—Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review<br><br>“Whitehead’s magnetic characters exemplify stoicism and courage, and each&nbsp;<b>supremely crafted</b>scene smolders and flares with injustice and resistance, building to a staggering revelation. Inspired by an actual school, Whitehead’s potently concentrated drama pinpoints the brutality and insidiousness of Jim Crow racism with compassion and protest. . . .&nbsp;<b>A&nbsp;scorching work</b>.”&nbsp;<i>—Booklist</i>, starred review<br><br>“<b>[A] stunning new novel</b>. . . . The understated beauty of his writing, combined with the disquieting subject matter, creates a kind of dissonance that chills the reader. Whitehead has long had a gift for crafting unforgettable characters, and Elwood proves to be one of his best. . . . The final pages of the book are a heartbreaking distillation of the story that preceded them; it’s a perfect ending to a perfect novel.&nbsp;<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is a beautiful, wrenching act of witness, a painful remembrance of an ‘infinite brotherhood of broken boys,’ and it&nbsp;<b>proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Whitehead is one of the most gifted novelists in America today.</b>” —NPR<br><br>“<b>Magnificent</b>. . . . Whitehead’s prose is meticulous; he nimbly shifts between the 1960s and present day, creating a fully fleshed-out picture of violence and (in)justice.” —<i>Buzzfeed</i><br><br>“Colson Whitehead’s follow-up to&nbsp;<i>The Underground Railroad</i>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<b>devastating and powerful</b>, a harrowing novelization on another dark aspect of American history.&nbsp;. . . Never didactic, but always&nbsp;<b>illuminating</b>—even in those darkest of places in our collective story—<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<b>brilliant</b>, horrifying look into the legacy of Jim Crow, and the ways in which racism and oppression don’t exist in defiance to the American Dream, but rather as its fuel.” —<i>NYLON</i><br><br>“[<i>The Nickel Boys’</i>s] dialogue, the efficient character sketches and the unobtrusive but always-advancing plot are evidence of mature ability . . . spry and animated and seamed with dark humor . . . [with] a dazzling final twist that Mr. Whitehead stages with such casual skill that one only begins to unpack its meanings well after the book has ended. . . . The excellence of&nbsp;<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;carries an added feeling of hope because it’s evidence of a gradual, old-fashioned artistic progression that fewer and fewer writers are allowed the time to pursue. . .&nbsp;<i>. The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;demonstrate the versatile gifts of a writer who is rounding into mastery. The impression left is that&nbsp;<b>Mr. Whitehead can succeed at any kind of book he takes on. He has made himself one of the finest novelists in America</b>.” —<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>“Whitehead’s new novel . . . is in many ways a continuation of his reassessment of African American history. But&nbsp;<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is no mere sequel . . . it’s a surprisingly different kind of novel. . . . Whitehead reveals the clandestine atrocities of Nickel Academy with just enough restraint to keep us in a state of wincing dread. . . . It shreds our easy confidence in the triumph of goodness and leaves in its place a hard and bitter truth about the ongoing American experiment.” —<i>The Washington Post<br></i><br>“Again [Whitehead is] wrestling with American history’s reverberations. . . . Since its moral concern is multigenerational anguish, the sense of mourning in&nbsp;<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is subvisceral—not detached, but restrained. . . . We are called to remember, ‘The past is never dead. It’s not even past.'” —<i>O: The Oprah Magazine</i><br><br>“Possibly the single most anticipated novel of the year.” —<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>“A powerful meditation on suffering and injustice. . . . His subject could not be more demanding, but Whitehead’s writing is spare and stately. He handles Elwood’s and Turner’s suffering—and questions—gently. And he holds the reader carefully. . . . For the darkest of tales, that is the most a writer can do.”&nbsp;—<i>Winnipeg Free Press</i><br><br>“Whitehead’s signature knack for creating unforgettable characters and spinning compelling stories out of even the darkest places is on display once again—and while it’s not always an easy story to read, we’d venture to say it’s essential.”&nbsp;—<i>Town and Country</i><br><br>“If you thought Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel&nbsp;<i>The Underground Railroad</i>&nbsp;was a tour de force,&nbsp;wait until you get your hands on<i>&nbsp;The Nickel Boys</i>.”&nbsp;—<i>Harper’s Bazaar</i><br><br>“<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is straight-ahead realism, distinguished by its clarity and its open conversation with other black writers: It quotes from or evokes the work of Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison and more. Whitehead has made an overt bid to stand in their company—to write a novel that’s memorable, and teachable, for years to come.&nbsp;<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is its fulfilment.” —<i>USA Today</i><br><br>“<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is a strictly realist work, albeit still ripe with Whitehead’s signature deadpan wit. . . . The heart of&nbsp;<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is this extended dialogue between Elwood and Turner . . . [and] often feels like Whitehead’s conversation with both the idealistic forerunners of the civil rights generation and, by implication, the woke youth of today. Like perhaps his single greatest influence, Ralph Ellison, Whitehead negotiates a tightrope walk between the need to depict the experience of race and racism and a stubborn individualistic resistance to the claims of collective identity.” —<i>Slate</i><br><br>“[Whitehead’s] prose here is elegant yet straightforward . . . these short sentences spur the action on, creating a pace that’s almost as breath-taking as the novel’s depiction of cruelty. . . . Whitehead’s novel is certainly revelatory, but more for the ways in which it traces these atrocities to the past and present, weaving tragedy into multiple lifetimes.&nbsp;<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;isn’t just a testament to systemic racism; it’s an archaeology of pain.” —<i>A.V. Club</i><br><br>“[<i>The Nickel Boys</i>&nbsp;is] a marvellous play between the real situation and a novelistic artifice—one which, in the end, proves to be inherent in the human story. . . . This is a heartbreakingly good novel. Its excellence doesn’t lie in the attitude it takes to a social problem. . . . Rather, this is a book which should last because of the elegant refinement of its treatment, and the harmonious and deeply affecting balance it strikes between real-life conditions, and the requirements of the finest and most penetrating art.” —<i>The Spectator</i><br><br>“[A] remarkable novel.” —Roxane Gay, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Bad Feminist</i><br><br>“A gripping and brilliant novel based on a true story about a boys’ reformatory school in Florida in the 1960s. Whitehead is one of the most daring and gifted authors writing these days, and I will never miss one of his books.”<i>—</i>Elizabeth Gilbert, author of&nbsp;<i>City of Girls<br><br></i>“[Whitehead] is a splendidly talented writer, with more range than any other American novelist currently working—he can be funny, lyrical, satirical, earnest—whatever is needed by the work.” —George Saunders, author of<i>&nbsp;<i>Lincoln in the Bardo</i>,</i> </p>

His grandmother Hattie had a few gospel records, which she only played when the world discovered a new mean way to work on her, and Elwood wasn&rsquo;t allowed to listen to the Motown groups or popular songs like that on account of their licentious nature. The rest of his presents that year were clothes &ndash; a new red sweater, socks &ndash; and he certainly wore those out, but nothing endured such good and constant use as the record. Every scratch and pop it gathered over the months was a mark of his enlightenment, tracking each time he entered into a new understanding of the Reverend&rsquo;s words. The crackle of truth. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They didn&rsquo;t have a TV set but Dr. King&rsquo;s speeches were such a vivid chronicle -- containing all that the Negro had been and all that he would be -- that the record was almost as good as television. Maybe even better, grander, like the towering screen at the Davis Drive-In, which he&rsquo;d been to twice. Elwood saw it all: Africans persecuted by the white sin of slavery, Negroes humiliated and kept low by segregation, and that luminous image to come, when all those places closed to his race were opened.<br> The speeches had been recorded all over, Detroit and Charlotte and Montgomery, connecting Elwood to the rights struggle across the country. One speech even made him feel like a member of the King family. Every kid had heard of Fun Town, been there or envied someone who had. In the third cut on Side A, Dr. King spoke of how his daughter longed to visit the amusement park on Stewart Ave in Atlanta. Yolanda begged her parents whenever she spotted the big sign from the expressway or the commercials came on TV. Dr. King had to tell her in his low, sad rumble about the segregation system that kept colored boys and girls on the other side of the fence. Explain the misguided thinking of some whites -- not all whites, but enough whites &ndash; that gave it force and meaning. He counseled his daughter to resist the lure of hatred and bitterness and assured her that &ldquo;Even though you can&rsquo;t go to Fun Town, you are as good as anyone who gets to go to Fun Town.&rdquo;<br> That was Elwood -- good as anyone. A hundred miles south of Atlanta, in Tallahassee. Sometimes he saw a Fun Town commercial while visiting his cousins in Georgia. Lurching rides and happy music, chipper white kids lining up for the Wild Mouse Roller Coaster, Dick&rsquo;s Mini Golf. Strap into the Atomic Rocket for a Trip to the Moon. A perfect report card guaranteed free admission, the commercials said, if your teacher stamped a red mark on it. Elwood got all A&rsquo;s and kept his stack of evidence for the day they opened Fun Town to all God&rsquo;s children, as Dr. King promised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get in free every day for a month, easy,&rdquo; he told his grandmother, lying on the front room rug and tracing a threadbare patch with his thumb.<br> His grandmother Hattie had rescued the rug from the alley behind the Richmond Hotel after the last renovation. The bureau in her room, the tiny table next to Elwood&rsquo;s bed, and three lamps were also Richmond castoffs. Hattie had worked at the hotel since she was fourteen, when she joined her mother on the cleaning staff. Once Elwood entered high school, the hotel manager Mr. Parker made it clear he&rsquo;d hire him as a porter whenever he wanted, smart kid like him, and the white man was disappointed when the boy began working at Marconi&rsquo;s Tobacco &amp; Cigars. Mr. Parker was always kind to the family, even after he had to fire Elwood&rsquo;s mother for stealing.<br> Elwood liked the Richmond and he liked Mr. Parker, but adding a fourth generation to the hotel&rsquo;s accounts made him uneasy in a way he found difficult to describe. Even before the encyclopedias. When he was younger, he sat on a crate in the hotel kitchen after school, reading comic books and Hardy Boys while his grandmother straightened and scrubbed upstairs. With both his parents gone, she preferred to have her nine-year-old grandson nearby instead of alone in the house. Seeing Elwood with the kitchen men made her think those afternoons were a kind of school in their own right, that it was good for him to be around men. The cooks and waiters took the boy for a mascot, playing hide and seek with him and peddling creaky wisdom on various topics: the white man&rsquo;s ways, how to treat a good-time gal, strategies for hiding money around the house. Elwood didn&rsquo;t understand what the older men talked about most of the time, but he nodded gamely before returning to his adventure stories.<br> After rushes, Elwood sometimes challenged the dishwashers to plate-drying races and they made a good-natured show of being disappointed by his superior skills. They liked seeing his smile and his odd delight at each win. Then the staff turned over. The new downtown hotels poached personnel, cooks came and went, a few of the waiters didn&rsquo;t return after the kitchen reopened from the flood damage. With the change in staff, Elwood&rsquo;s races changed from endearing novelty to mean-spirited hustle; the latest dishwashers were tipped off that the grandson of one the cleaning girls did your work for you if told him it was a game, keep on the lookout. Who was this serious boy who loitered around while the rest of them busted their asses, getting little pats on the head from Mr. Parker like he was a damn puppy, nose in a comic book like he hadn&rsquo;t a care? The new men in the kitchen had different kinds of lessons to impart to a young mind. Stuff they&rsquo;d learned about the world.

There were legends about the valuables that rich white people left in their rooms, but it was rare that this kind of plunder made it down to their domain. Barney the cook opened the top box and held up the leather-bound volume of <i>Fisher&rsquo;s Universal Encyclopedia, Aa-Be.<\/i> He handed it to Elwood, who was surprised at how heavy it was, a brick with pages edged in red. The boy flipped through, squinting at the tiny words &ndash;<i> Aegean, Argonaut, Archimedes<\/i> &ndash; and had a picture of himself on the front room couch copying words he liked.

He was hired to bus tables, but after a few incidents they moved him to the kitchen.

Pete wiped his hands on his pants and said, &ldquo;We got time before the dinner service, if you&rsquo;re up for it.&rdquo;<br> The kitchen made a proper contest of it. The biggest yet. A stopwatch was produced and handed to Len, the gray-haired waiter who&rsquo;d worked at the Hotel for over twenty years.

With his attention to detail, he&rsquo;d make a dedicated referee. Two fifty-plate stacks were arranged, after a proper soaking supervised by Elwood and Pete. The two busboys acted as seconds for this duel, ready to hand over dry replacement rags when requested. A lookout stood at the kitchen door in case a manager happened by.<br> While not prone to bravado, Elwood had never lost a dish-drying contest in four years, and wore his confidence on his face. Pete had a concentrated air. Elwood didn&rsquo;t perceive the Texan as a threat, having out-dried the man in prior competitions. Pete was, in general, a good loser.<br> Len counted down from ten, and they began. Elwood stuck to the method he&rsquo;d perfected over the years, mechanistic and gentle. He&rsquo;d never let a wet plate slip or chipped one by setting it on the counter too quickly. As the kitchen men cheered them on, Pete&rsquo;s mounting stack of dried plates unnerved Elwood. The Texan had an edge on him, displaying new reserves. The on-lookers made astonished noises. Elwood hurried, chasing after the image of the encyclopedias in their front room.<br> Len said, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;<br> Elwood won by one plate. The men hollered and laughed and traded glances whose meaning Elwood would interpret later.<br> Harold, one of the busboys, slapped Elwood on the back. &ldquo;You were made to wash dishes, slick.&rdquo; The kitchen laughed.<br> Elwood returned volume <i>Aa to Be<\/i> to its box. It was a fancy reward.<br> &ldquo;You earned it,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;I hope you get a lot of use out of them.&rdquo;<br> Elwood asked the housekeeping manager to tell his grandmother he&rsquo;d see her at home. He couldn&rsquo;t wait to see the look on her face when she saw the encyclopedia on their bookshelves, elegant and distinguished. He dragged the boxes to the bus stop on Tennessee, hunched. To see him from across the street &ndash; the serious young lad heaving his freight of the world&rsquo;s knowledge &ndash; was to witness a scene that might have been illustrated by Norman Rockwell, if Elwood had had white skin.<br> At home, he cleared Hardy Boys and Tom Swifts from the green bookcase in the front room and unpacked the boxes. He paused with <i>Ga<\/i>, curious to see how the smart men at the Fisher company handled <i>galaxy<\/i>. The pages were blank &ndash; all of them. Every volume in the first box was blank except for the one he&rsquo;d seen in the kitchen. He opened the other two boxes, his face getting hot. All the books were empty.<br> When his grandmother came home, she shook her head and told him maybe they were defective, or dummy copies the salesman showed to customers as samples, so they could see how a full set would look in their homes. That night in bed his thoughts ticked and hummed like a contraption. It occurred to him that the busboy, that all the men in the kitchen, had known the books were empty. That they had put on a show.<br> He kept the encyclopedias in the bookcase anyway. They looked impressive, even when the humidity peeled back the covers. The leather was fake, too.<br> The next afternoon in the kitchen was his last. Everyone paid too much attention to his face. Cory tested him with &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you like those books?&rdquo; and waited for a reaction. Over by the sink Peter had a smile that looked as if it had been hacked into his jaw with a knife. They knew. His grandmother agreed that he was old enough to stay in the house by himself. Through high school, he went back and forth over the matter of whether the dishwashers had let him win all along. He&rsquo;d been so proud of his ability, dumb and simple as it was. He never settled on one conclusion until he got to Nickel, which made the truth of the contests unavoidable.<br><br> &#160;<br><br><div id=\"excerpt-newsletter-wrap-mobile\"><\/div><br \/><span class=\"excrpt_cp\">Excerpted from <span class=\"excrpt_cp_ttl\">The Nickel Boys<\/span> by Colson Whitehead.
