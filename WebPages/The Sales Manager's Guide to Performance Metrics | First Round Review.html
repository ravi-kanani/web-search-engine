She started out in consulting and finance, and then moved into sales operations (previously at LinkedIn and currently as the Head of Customer Success and Sales Strategy at <strong class="Annotation -strong"><a href="https://www.atriumhq.com/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">Atrium</a></strong><a href="https://www.atriumhq.com/" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link"></a>). And as she shared on the Review last year, she’s put those experiences to work, advising sales teams and developing <a href="https://firstround.com/review/growth-at-all-costs-is-perilous-this-is-how-to-scale-sales-sustainably/" class="Annotation -link">a disciplined, metrics-driven framework for growing sales sustainably</a>.</p>
    <p id="text_394243fb87ff40b8982d0cd2e0c174c9" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">So it comes as no surprise then that Rhorer firmly believes sales managers have an unprecedented opportunity to lean into the numbers in order to level up as coaches for their reps. But in her experience, most are leaving that potential untapped.</p>
    <p id="text_a5adbbcf53f24ac19ba289bd31ae065e" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Take this cautionary tale from the sales floor of a startup: A sales manager reported to the Head of Sales that one of his reports was underperforming. When the company brought in Atrium’s analytics software to help dig into the numbers, the data told a different story about the “underperforming” report. It turned out that she was diligently working her own opportunities and closing business, while others who appeared more successful were in fact beneficiaries of profitable “bluebird” deals handed down from more senior outside reps. Faced with the data, the sales manager later admitted why his concern was piqued: When he walked around the sales floor, he didn’t hear the “struggling” rep making calls, so he assumed she was falling behind.</p>
    <p id="text_e60294b75fa6418b885fb35c0c0fc43e" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">The story underscores a deep-seated problem that Rhorer’s seen afflict startup sales teams: Managers place too much importance on coarse rules of thumb, passing observations and lagging indicators, instead of digging deeper to uncover the <em class="Annotation -emphasis">real</em> drivers of their team’s performance. “<strong class="Annotation -strong">Many sales managers default to assessing reps based on one metric: whether or not they’re hitting their quotas. But one metric doesn’t tell the whole story — you need to unpack the <em class="Annotation -emphasis">why</em></strong><em class="Annotation -emphasis"></em> behind whether or not your reps are making quota, to help them do more of what’s working or figure out where things are going awry,” she says.</p>
    <p id="text_a150073e2a78479096ed9e114ed02f3c" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">In other words, sales managers need to put in the legwork to offer more targeted coaching to their reps in order to end the endless churn-and-burn hiring cycle that plagues many sales teams. “<strong class="Annotation -strong">As a function, we too often present distant goal posts in the form of ambitious quotas, don’t give reps any direction on how to get there, and then put them on a PIP or fire them when they don’t reach their targets.</strong> That’s a fundamentally broken approach,” says Rhorer. “Sales leaders have a responsibility to proactively probe and diagnose performance issues, <em class="Annotation -emphasis">before</em> they become a problem.”</p>
    <p id="text_5db1443a7b2f49a1b1e2d15e8399ac4d" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">But all too often, most sales managers (especially first-timers) aren’t equipped for that challenge. “Sales is a sink or swim environment. There aren’t many coaching opportunities at most startups, and the skills that earned you a promotion up from AE don't map over to what you’ll take on as a team lead,” says Rhorer. “So many wind up just riding along on every call, thinking that’s the most effective way to help their team improve. But that limits both your wingspan and your effectiveness as a manager.”</p>

In addition to seriously digging into the mechanics of sales math, she covers everything from structuring stellar 1:1 conversations to tips for doing PIPs the right way.</p>
    <p id="text_f1357e49108e4f35b87a385bad779200" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">In this exclusive interview, Rhorer shares those lessons and <strong class="Annotation -strong">gets tactical on how sales managers should be using data —&nbsp;not for data’s own sake, but to drive winning performance on their teams</strong>. She outlines how to keep a steady thumb on the pulse of performance while cultivating the chops leaders need to support reps who aren’t quite there yet. Whether you’re an early-stage founder trying to diagnose where sales is going wrong, a newly promoted sales manager looking to learn the ropes or a seasoned leader with sights set on scaling sales, her advice is essential for course-correcting performance problems before they’re fatal —&nbsp;and investing in the habits that build high-performing sales teams. Let’s dive in.</p>

    <p id="text_c85b3b9457734d7181c54c330e8e61ec" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Rhorer emphasizes that leadership is only strengthened by a sales math bootcamp. Data gives sales leaders the opportunity to become more effective and meaningful coaches to their teams. “With an eye for the data, managers can make a clear-eyed assessment of individual strengths and development areas. Then, they can use that insight to elevate the trajectory of their reps’ performance,” says Rhorer.</p>
    <p id="text_f2e9c234318448cd837229c63f0100f0" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">According to Rhorer, brushing up on their data chops helps sales leaders fulfill the three things that all managers owe to their teams:</p>

     <li><p id="text_d6b38795c64c4819a93e1cbff05d49b2" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"> <strong class="Annotation -strong">Opportunity for mastery:</strong> “According to Daniel Pink’s <a href="https://www.danpink.com/drive./" data-external="true" class="Annotation -link">Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</a>, mastery is one of the main drivers of our professional lives.

    <p id="text_cb35a785dcc2417a87617fcb91507f6c" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">And data is a powerful tool to help sales leaders deliver on these responsibilities. Of course, the problem isn’t that startups <em class="Annotation -emphasis">don’t</em> want to take advantage of sales data. Rhorer breaks down three challenges that often hinder companies, especially startups, from taking full advantage of the tools in their arsenal — and how even the scrappiest startup can overcome them, today:</p>
    <ul class="Block ListBlock -role--unordered">
     <li><p id="text_d7b8930089404628a920cf737cb2eaeb" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"> <strong class="Annotation -strong">Not having enough time to gather and review data.</strong> “Especially at fast-paced startups, taking a microscope to the data isn’t usually a top priority. But if you can only keep track of a handful of metrics, that’s still progress. Even limited data can tell you <em class="Annotation -emphasis">something</em>.”</p></li>
     <li><p id="text_c4914cfa1e5d4e4bbe5579b66f7665fb" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"> <strong class="Annotation -strong">Data overload.</strong> “Some orgs gather data for the sake of gathering data, without knowing how to make sense of it. Data overload doesn’t lead anywhere productive —&nbsp;and it leads to a lot of wasted time and resources.

     <li><p id="text_f9fd3d1556644ff58b9af87183b14575" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"> <strong class="Annotation -strong">Leaving data on the back-burner.</strong> “I’ve seen some cases where <a href="https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/" class="Annotation -link">a company has found product/market fit</a> with strong inbound lead flow, so they don’t feel the need to worry about tracking sales metrics yet because the sales team is successful on the strength of those inbound leads. That’s a great position to be in right now — but that’s seldom a permanent state. What if those inbound leads don’t scale, and you need to add outbound later? If you haven’t been tracking metrics that whole time, you’ll quickly find yourself in stormy skies, flying blind.”</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p id="text_081dadd4f3f94f65a5310b8b3e6ac61c" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong">In other words, sales leaders of companies at all stages can and should be digging into the numbers —&nbsp;and the earlier you get started, the better.</strong> In the sections that follow, Rhorer gets down to brass tacks about how managers can use data to incorporate the three elements of data-driven management into their routine practices: setting targeted goals for reps, leading high-value performance check-ins, and designing proactive performance conversations and interventions that empower reports and deliver results.</p>

    <p id="text_c01fee3392c24196930d2a67d55a4ac1" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Data gives sales leaders a clear blueprint for how to coach individual reps. “Using data as a coaching tool is especially useful for early-stage companies that don’t have a well-developed sales enablement function,” says Rhorer.</p>
    <p id="text_7fbae160a912409882aa5b4b138d3c56" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“Because startups are strapped for resources, sales training often only covers broadly applicable topic areas. That broad training doesn’t help when an individual rep struggles with a more specific challenge,” she says. “On the other hand, if managers have a strong grasp on the data, they can use it to diagnose issues and set targeted performance goals that help reps grow over the long-term.”</p>
    <p id="text_20020f151da94ddbbbb0ad2f4278572a" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">For sales leaders ready to flex their data muscles, Rhorer outlines the basic steps for starting to orient your team around data:</p>

    <p id="text_59cb7536ce6845d98429d8cc335dffa7" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">But it isn’t enough to simply quantify goals — the metrics you choose to focus on matter.

    <p id="text_ffec56d8907a4c929a346f7729f3e24e" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">For example, while SMB AEs close smaller details (with a lower Average Selling Price), they generally work more deals at a time (higher number of Opps Worked) because of a simpler sales process and a shorter sales cycle time, compared with enterprise AEs selling to fewer companies at higher prices.</p>
    <p id="text_9128c4d2a228447c854292b8e1542c6e" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“If one of these metrics declines, an AE needs to ‘make up’ the magnitude of that impact from one of the other drivers,” she says, “which they can only do if they understand how each one impacts their overall performance.”</p>

    <p id="text_64c09749ec494836b3c73b00dfbeddc1" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“The first piece of the evaluation is whether the rep is carrying carrying out the right actions to try to be successful. <strong class="Annotation -strong">It focuses on those metrics most directly within the rep’s control</strong>,” says Rhorer. “Does the rep have any untouched opportunities in his pipeline? Is he reaching out to a number of contacts at each account touched that is consistent with your expectations and sales approach?”</p>
    <p id="text_7c9c5f8ef01f4302b93e4cd5b0e0e031" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Investigate the dashboard to fully answer these questions. “If those numbers aren’t being hit, what’s causing low activity numbers? Is it lack of will, or are there blockers that you, as the manager, need to remove, like insufficient accounts in his name?”</p>

    <p id="text_d58802c23ef04455a45f321397e8b953" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Next, address whether that effort is effectively filling the top of the AE’s pipeline. “Look at the conversion rate on email and call activity,” says Rhorer. “Are those activities generating the expected number of initial meetings with new prospects? That number of initial meetings scheduled is a function of how effectively the rep is communicating the value proposition and handling objections while they’re setting up the initial meeting.”</p>
    <p id="text_8dd37573f426451a8dd57057b3ed8a19" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong">Effectiveness in Qualifying:</strong> <em class="Annotation -emphasis">Is the rep’s effort being focused in a productive direction?</em></p>
    <p id="text_14946863029248afb6c6a5ca6b09f215" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“This is a question of whether the AE is efficient and effective or whether he’s spending too much time on unproductive activities,” says Rhorer. “This is either because he’s working deals that he never properly qualified or because he takes an overly optimistic approach to his pipeline and continues to chase deals that should have been Closed Lost.”</p>
    <p id="text_e075a64f3ad8409f982e2b6853244543" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">To diagnose this performance area, there are a few metrics you can turn to. “You might look at opportunity conversation rates by stage to see where in the funnel opportunities are dropping off, or review other efficiency metrics like follow-up meeting ratio, which will indicate how effectively the rep is able to convert an initial meeting with an account into a real shot at a deal,” she says. “For example, if a rep is inefficient because of a ‘happy ears’ problem, it’ll show up as Closed Lost opportunities with multiple meetings against them.”</p>
    <p id="text_670c586fff85447d81d2acba493467ab" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><strong class="Annotation -strong">Effectiveness in Closing:</strong> Is the quality of bottom-of-funnel activity sufficient to turn opportunities into bookings?</p>
    <p id="text_e66143953c794a2d9889a2491eba4cff" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">The most immediate drivings of bookings will shed light on this question. “If bookings are soft, but the rep is doing the right things to fill the top of the pipeline and working a commensurate number of opportunities to the rest of the team, then he will either have a lower average deal size or lower win rates than the rest of the team,” says Rhorer.</p>
    <p id="text_cb6c6bdcb0b34ebbaa66a21d7757fdb2" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“These may show up in the ‘mid-funnel’ precursor metrics, but may also be caused by behaviors that appear at the end of the sales process. For example, smaller deal sizes may show up only in the ‘average selling price’ metric if the cause is overly aggressive discounting,” she says. “A lower win rate caused by late stage deals moving to Closed Lost may prompt a look into whether those opportunities properly hit the entry criteria for those stages or a look into how reps are running their closing meetings.”</p>

    <p id="text_9b6424ee36e54f99a9535a167f080e11" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">A PIP is perhaps <a href="https://firstround.com/review/The-Best-Approach-to-the-Worst-Conversation/" class="Annotation -link">one of the most dread-inducing acronyms in management</a>. Putting a report on a formal PIP spells a “last chance” for issues to be remedied. “A PIP should <em class="Annotation -emphasis">never</em> come as a surprise,” says Rhorer. “If there were issues before, you should have been communicating about them on an ongoing basis.”</p>
    <p id="text_76d626d4f4db4bd0b5fba7f8d2583668" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">If you’ve reached the point where you need to pull out the PIP, it must be clear and attainable above all. “Structure the PIP with goals for specific metrics to improve, with associated timelines that make sense for each metric,” says Rhorer. “Get detailed here: <strong class="Annotation -strong">Give your report the clearest idea of <em class="Annotation -emphasis">when</em> you expect to see the changes and <em class="Annotation -emphasis">what</em> the magnitude of change has to be</strong>.”</p>
    <p id="text_2f3c35f025da4ea6989715b2597d6a87" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">A rep successfully exiting a PIP requires commitment from both sides of the table. “Commit to what you’ll do as their manager to help them succeed. Give them an expectation of what feedback and interim check-ins will look like, and hold yourself to those.” For example, if a report was struggling under the “Effectiveness in Capturing Prospect Interest” area, you might write the following in their PIP:</p>
    <p id="text_816b663f41dc48bf9b3eb0d65e74ac12" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><em class="Annotation -emphasis">“By the end of the PIP, Rep should increase win rate on closed opportunities from x% to y%. Progress between now and the end of the PIP will be tracked on the following metrics:</em></p>
    <p id="text_3baa85db02704ff1917afc9a76024292" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><em class="Annotation -emphasis">1. For each initial meeting held, at least x follow-up meetings should be generated, for a target ratio of y:z of initial meetings to follow-up meetings.</em></p>
    <p id="text_7735fbb141a343f287555ef1031895f6" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><em class="Annotation -emphasis">2. The total number of follow-up meeting should reach at least x by the third week of the PIP and should stay at that level for the duration of the PIP.</em></p>
    <p id="text_22bf7bbde20148d0a6cbae4dd861f775" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><em class="Annotation -emphasis">3. Beginning in the third week of the PIP, at least x% of the opportunities owned by Rep should meet the entry criteria to advance to the next stage of the sales funnel, which should result in y total opportunities advancing each [week/month] (depending on your own pipeline velocity) and a conversion rate from Stage x to Stage y of z%.</em></p>
    <p id="text_56b210094eee41d896d0e78696a57799" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph"><em class="Annotation -emphasis">4. To support this goal, Manager will join at least x sales calls with open opportunities each week and will provide Rep with coaching and detailed feedback after those calls.”</em></p>
    <h2 id="text_1860b6b8f8e04f3597a80e04708f7541" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--heading">PAVING THE WAY FOR A DATA-DRIVEN FUTURE</h2>
    <p id="text_21cc006439444f799c3a7e6fc6fd6a10" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Using data as a resource is such a highly-valued practice at Atrium that it’s integrated into their interview process for sales and customer success managers. “In one part of the interview, we ask candidates for sales manager roles to evaluate a sales rep based on a given set of data,” says Rhorer. “We ask them why this hypothetical AE is successful, and where coaching opportunities are.”</p>
    <p id="text_746202cb8c5a49c0bf4be1f25efb29c0" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">The candidate doesn’t necessarily need to be trained in data analysis. “We’re looking for them to ask good questions. We want them to show curiosity and to unpack what’s going on,” she says. “<strong class="Annotation -strong">When you’re hiring reps, or even promoting people in the sales org, look for people who are inclined to be thinking about data</strong>.” That way, you’re not only building out your team with talented operators, but building a culture around using data to catalyze goals and contribute to a progressively more robust sales org.</p>
    <p id="text_8cf379c8abea42d7a9e16b8b24fb81d1" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">Above all, Rhorer emphasizes that no one is born with a knack for data-based management. “All of this is learnable,” she says. “Managers who are eager to learn how to wield data, and are willing to put in the hard work, have already accomplished the hardest part.”</p>
    <p id="text_88bb215d8f244a99a64bae358cde0619" class="Block TextBlock -align--left -role--paragraph">“A data-driven sales org triggers a positive domino effect in the company,” she says. “The CEO and board can focus on other priorities rather than monitoring sales. Longer runway from the same amount of capital gives you more time to build the business before having to raise again; when you do raise, you’ll have higher revenue and better unit economics, resulting in equity that’s more valuable.”</p>
