      <p> Lori Deschene has written a powerful book with a powerful message. "365 Tiny Love Challenges"—it sounds simple, but take on even a few of these challenges, and you will quickly discover more intimacy, connection, and love in your relationships and your life.

     <p>Many of us know that meaningful connections are the foundation of a happy life, but that doesn’t necessarily make it any easier to create and sustain fulfilling, mutually beneficial relationships.</p> 
     <p>It’s hard to find people we click with and turn surface level interactions, online or offline, into something deeper. </p> 
     <p>It’s hard to be forgiving, accepting, and understanding when we’re dealing with imperfect people, just like us, who may also struggle with these things.</p> 
     <p>It’s hard to find time to be there for others when we’re running from place to place, trying to get things done, and possibly struggling to make ends meet.</p> 
     <p>And it’s hard to be fully present when we find the time, since we’re often overwhelmed by a swarm of thoughts, fears, and worries about the past and the future.</p> 
     <p>It’s a lot easier, though, when we make the effort to work on these things regularly—and even the tiniest effort can make a big difference. </p> 
     <p>No matter who you are, what you’ve done in the past, or what time you have available in the present, you can do something, right now, to create more satisfying relationships. </p> 
     <p><strong><em>Tiny Buddha’s 365 Tiny Love Challenges</em> can help.</strong></p> 
     <p>Including more than 70 stories from Tiny Buddha contributors on kindness, forgiveness, and more, the book offers a year of simple daily activities to help you give and receive more love.</p> 
     <p>Each day suggests one simple thing you can do to love yourself or others in action, such as:</p> 
     <p><em>Write a list of three things you appreciate about yourself and place it somewhere in your home where you’ll frequently see it throughout the day.</em></p> 
     <p><em>Compliment someone who serves you in some way (for example, a waiter, barista, or bus driver) on how well they do their job.</em></p> 
     <p><em>Keep an eye out for someone who looks sad—a friend, coworker, or even stranger—and say something that might make them laugh or smile.</em></p> 
     <p>If you commit to working on these things daily, the challenges will help you:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Develop closer bonds in your relationships </li> 
      <li>Let your guard down more easily to let people in </li> 
      <li>Express your feelings instead of hiding them </li> 
      <li>Let go of anger, bitterness, and fear </li> 
      <li>See the best in the people around you </li> 
      <li>Relate to and better understand your loved ones </li> 
      <li>Let go of insecurity so you can relax in your interactions </li> 
      <li>Turn strangers into friends </li> 
      <li>Attract healthier relationships—and believe that you deserve them </li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>With monthly themes to help you focus on different aspects of relationships, <em>Tiny Buddha’s 365 Tiny Love Challenges</em> can help you feel more connected—to yourself, to the people around you, and to the world at large—one tiny action at a time.</p>

     <h1>About the Author</h1> 
     <img class="right" src="https://cdn.tinybuddha.com/wp-content/uploads/gly/images/lori.jpg" alt="Lori Deschene"> 
     <p><strong>My name is Lori Deschene and I'm the founder of Tiny Buddha.</strong></p> 
     <p>For most of my life I felt alone.</p> 
     <p>When I was younger, I was rarely by myself, busy as I was with school, work, and community theater. But I felt no one understood the depth of my pain and the depression and self-loathing that resulted from bullying—so I felt alone.</p> 
     <p>In college, I maintained a full schedule, adding even more work to the mix, and entered my first long-term relationship. He was one of the few who knew the severity of my bulimia. But I couldn’t communicate why I hurt myself in that way, since I didn’t fully understand it myself—so I felt alone.</p> 
     <p>After college, when I moved to NYC to escape the shame of my former life, I felt lost in a sea of people who knew me no better than the audience at a play. When I wasn’t wandering among the masses, I sat by myself in a cockroach-infested dorm style room, drinking, chain-smoking, and feeling down on myself—so I felt alone.</p> 
     <p>There is very little as painful as feeling alone in the world, like no one cares, no one knows you, and no one would you love you if they did.</p> 
     <p>I started Tiny Buddha, after years of hurting and healing, because I believe that no matter what we’re going through, we never have to feel alone.</p> 
     <p>Someone else has been there, someone else understands, and someone else wants to help.</p> 
     <p>Over the last six years, I’ve helped more than 1,200 people share their stories, insights, and lessons with more than 60 million readers. </p> 
     <p>I’ve seen people connect, inspire, and encourage each other. I’ve watched people bare their souls, open their hearts, and change each other’s lives.</p> 
     <p>I’d like to think I’ve done the same. In doing so, I’ve helped myself as much as anyone who’s read my words.</p> 
     <p>Still, while sharing myself vulnerably in writing has helped me feel more empowered and less alone, that’s not what’s made the most significant difference in my level of connection.</p> 
     <p>Baring my soul for millions of people was infinitely easier than being vulnerable with one. And that’s been my greatest challenge. </p> 
     <p>Looking someone in the eye and saying, “I’m sorry.” Saying “I forgive you” in my head when someone didn’t say those words to me. Showing up and speaking up when I feared I might be judged or rejected. Telling someone I admire them, and why. Listening fully to someone else instead of thinking obsessively about myself and my struggles.</p> 
     <p>These are the tiny, sometimes-difficult daily choices that have enabled me to feel less alone, and to give back to others what I’ve always hoped to get from them.</p> 
     <p>These are the steps that have pulled me from the depths of isolation and self-absorption into what I call a “peopled life.”</p> 
     <p>I am not always trusting. I am not always secure. I am not always understanding, giving, or kind. But I work at it, every day. And I can feel a difference, every day.</p> 
     <p>I created this book to share what’s helped me, and others, live full, connected lives, with less fear and more love.</p> 
     <p>Unlikely many self-help proponents, I don’t believe we can only feel one or the other, but I believe we can feel the latter more often if we make the effort—and I believe we, and the world, will be better for it.</p>
