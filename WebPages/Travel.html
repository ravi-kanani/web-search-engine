Don't buy tickets on the weekend. Buy them on Tuesdays at this specific time. Wait until three days before you need to fly for a sudden price drop. Never search for the same flight more than three times. Log out of every browser and social network before even looking up flights. \nMost of the questionable logic behind these pieces of advice don't hold up. And even one that seems like a clear winner in the age of ubiquitous internet surveillance is less helpful than it seems: When tracking down cheap flights online, it's best to turn off all tracking. \nGo private, and quickly\nChris Rodgers, CEO of search-engine optimization agency Colorado SEO Pros, suggests using private browsing, but it might not actually do much more than give you peace of mind. On the Chrome browser that means opening an \"incognito\" window. Your smartphone browser, like Safari on iOS, has private browsing, as well. \n\"It is a good idea to use private browsing ... when searching for flights to prevent as much tracking as possible,\" Rodgers said in a recent email conversation. \"This could help prevent specific rate hikes that could be tied to an individual user's new and return sessions.\" He advises on quick decision-making instead of repeatedly returning to check on pricing over a long stretch of time with more opportunity for tracking.\nBut Rodgers admitted that pricing is more likely set by factors beyond your personal browsing history and settings, so this doesn't work every time.\nHe suggests researching flights as usual and then leaving the website and returning on a different device while in private browsing mode to actually buy the tickets. \"However if your fare is in high demand it may go up regardless,\" he warned. \n\nKayak, the flight and hotel aggregator, bursts any illusions that switching out devices or going incognito can help you save a few bucks. In fact, Kayak's North America regional director Steve Sintra, says logging into airline accounts or services like Kayak, Priceline, and Hipmunk might actually help you game the system. He said while signed onto your personal account you are more likely to see better fares and deals. But mostly it comes down to timing and availability.\nSintra said in a recent phone call, \"When you find a good fare, book it, don't wait.\"\nSEE ALSO: What to pack when traveling with your pet\nIf price is your only concern, aggregators can piece together an itinerary for you that may have the worst layovers and mixed-and-matched airlines, but — hey — it'll be cheaper. The more flexible you are on timing and other factors the more likely you'll find deals.\nBuy early \nYou might save a few bucks by waiting, but it's not usually worth it, Sintra said, with the extra stress, chance of losing a seat, and typically paying way more. \n\"The longer you wait the greater the likelihood the prices will go up,\" Sintra said.\nBased on historical data and flight pricing trends, Kayak has found that you'll find the best prices four months in advance for holiday travel. The two weeks before a flight doesn't suddenly mean a price drop, he added. Instead prices hold steady at what's usually the highest-cost flights. Prices fluctuate, so it can seem smart to wait and then suddenly you're kicking yourself if you miss a low-price window.\nShop the sales \nMyths about buying airline tickets on Tuesdays mostly stem from sale schedules. While most major airlines open up sales on Tuesdays, airline sales happen all the time. So yeah, you'll be able to book a flight with a potential discount on a Tuesday, but those prices will be available for however long the sale is running. \nYou can join airline email lists to get notified about flight sales directly in your inbox.\nBe cheap\nPlan your trip around cheaper travel days. If you travel on the actual holiday (Thanksgiving or Christmas Day instead of Dec. 22, for example) prices are typically lower. Same with travel after a holiday. If you can fly on a random Monday or Tuesday you'll see cheaper fares compared to a Friday or Sunday evening flight. \nOn Southwest's website, the low-fare calendar shows the lowest prices each day of the month. You can see the patterns for a November trip from San Francisco to Phoenix. Note the Nov. 11 Veterans Day holiday and how the pricing is higher around then.\n\nTricks and hacks aside, if you see a good flight that works for you, snatch it. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1076835%252F8a262947-7336-4cf6-b95c-29b2cbbb0e3f.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=xeeBWd8OwtlBn7p_6Rg_eEPxLHU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105092%252F8fb467b7-073e-4d58-ad76-0aaf699393e2.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=1cCeHDLmHalyPqj6B1-f93nrbEM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105092%252F8fb467b7-073e-4d58-ad76-0aaf699393e2.png%252F800x360.png?signature=SDT4GR-QBqbHZgEbC4fvtK5GX9k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105092%252F8fb467b7-073e-4d58-ad76-0aaf699393e2.png%252F1600x720.png?signature=e-mhOKoON6ARYMfavqp-lmUCjbE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"How to try to trick the internet for the best deals on flights","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105092%252F8fb467b7-073e-4d58-ad76-0aaf699393e2.png%252F800x360.png?signature=SDT4GR-QBqbHZgEbC4fvtK5GX9k=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"800","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105092%252F8fb467b7-073e-4d58-ad76-0aaf699393e2.png%252F800x360.png?signature=SDT4GR-QBqbHZgEbC4fvtK5GX9k=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","sizes":"800w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"How to try to trick the internet for the best deals on flights","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It pays to be cheap, secretive, flexible, and quick.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","sponsored_by":"","sponsored_by_url":"","order_number":"","tweet_text":"How to try to trick the internet for the best deals on flights"}

Sure, they're convenient — the whole having someone else make your bed thing is quite nice, tbh — but hotels can also be boooooorrrring. \n(It's the persistent sameness of hotels. Such repetition and ubiquity tends to trigger an existential crisis spiral where you begin to question how everything can be so different and yet all the same, like two mirrors that reflect an image ad infinitum, and really what IS anything when you get down to the nitty gritty minutiae of existence, ya know? Wait, that's just me? Cool. Glad we had this talk.)\nFortunately, there are a ton of options for travelers looking for a vacation rentals or really any alternative travel lodging. \nTwo of the leading platforms for finding alternative lodgings are Airbnb and Vrbo. Both are services that connect homeowners hoping to lease out their space with customers looking for short-term rentals, and each are recognizable for a variety of reasons.\nSEE ALSO: The best travel sites to help you plan the perfect trip\nAirbnb is known as a Silicon Valley darling, and hosts all kind of listings from tree houses to the underwater research ship featured on Blue Planet II. But the platform has also seen its fair share of controversy, for everything from concerns about affordable housing to fears that Airbnb hosts are spying on guests. Meanwhile Vrbo has been a key player in vacation rentals, helping pave the way for home sharing services since the '90s.\nAnd while the two platforms are similar in their core mission — showcasing home listings — each offers different perks and features that could make a big difference when you're planning your next trip. \nSo which rental site is right for you? Here's what you need to know if you're deciding between Airbnb and Vrbo.\nThe basics\nAirbnb\nFounded in 2008 originally as Air Bed and Breakfast until a 2009 rebrand, Airbnb is a home rental platform with a simple premise: connect homeowners to customers looking for short term rentals. The idea came from founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia in 2007 after the two were looking to rent space in their San Francisco apartment to help them afford the cost of rent. Later, they brought on Nathan Blecharczyk as chief technology officer, and Airbnb was born. Since its debut Airbnb, along with other services like Uber and TaskRabbit, have been considered a staple of the sharing economy.\n\nVrbo\nVrbo is short for Vacation Rental By Owner, and as the name implies, it specializes in vacation rentals of all types: houses, apartments, condos, villas, etc. The site was founded in 1995 and allows homeowners to advertise property listings to renters. In 2006, Vrbo was acquired by HomeAway, and joined the HomeAway network which includes other sites like VacationRentals.com.\n\nTypes of rentals\nAirbnb\nIf there is one thing that sets Airbnb apart from other platforms, it's the service's extensive host network that offers literally million of listings. In fact, Airbnb announced in 2017 that it hosts more than 4 million listings in over 191 countries. Anyone can become an Airbnb host and rent out spaces as big as a whole house or as small as a shared room.\nThe platform is also filled with unique and creative home experiences: With Airbnb, users can rent everything from a house created entirely out of Lego bricks to Donald Trump's childhood home (if you're into that sort of thing).\n\nVrbo\nLike Airbnb, anyone can become post a listing on Vrbo, and the site offers a range of rental types including houses, apartments, castles, tree houses, and more. However, unlike Airbnb, you can only rent entire homes on Vrbo, which means it has fewer rentals than Airbnb. (On Vrbo's website, it boasts that it has over 2 million rentals worldwide, compared to Airbnb's 4 million.) \nRather than listing smaller spaces like single rooms, Vrbo only lists larger spaces — whole houses, condos, or apartments that customers will have to themselves, rather than sharing with the homeowner or other guests. In fact, \"don't share\" became a marketing point in a 2016 ad about Airbnb vs. HomeAway (Vrbo's parent company). So while Vrbo offers fewer rentals, users can rest assured that the space they find will be completely theirs.\n\nReviews\nAirbnb\nLooking through property details is only one way that Airbnb users can learn about a potential home listed on Airbnb. The site also features an active review culture that lets guests leave their thoughts after their stay, ranking everything from the accuracy of the listing's description to the cleanliness of the property. The site's review section is also searchable, so if you have a particular concern while booking an Airbnb, you can filter reviews to address those worries.\nAnd bonus: the site includes a host community section so that hosts can give each other tips and tricks to successfully listing a property on Airbnb.\n\nVrbo\nVrbo also offers a review section that allows users to rate their stay at a particular property. However, the site also allows homeowners to post a response to the reviewer, which is displayed under a given review. This means not only can Vrbo users find out more information about the experience of staying at a property, they can also gain more insight from homeowners before they start the process of booking a stay.\nOther Perks\nAirbnb\n\nWhen Airbnb first debuted in 2008, it was simply a place to list and search short term lodgings. Now, 10 years after the site's founding, Airbnb has expanded, adding new tools to the service that make it a one stop shop for solidifying travel plans.\nIn addition to rentals, the company features a pretty robust \"experiences\" section that allows users to discover activities near their chosen destination. Experiences listed on Airbnb can include everything from walking tours to beach yoga and a hike through a forest with wolves.\nAlso, in 2017, the service partnered with Resy to allow users to book restaurant reservations directly through the site.\nVrbo\n\nWhere Vrbo shines over Airbnb is its suite of filters. Users can search by location type — beachside, lake view, mountain view, ski rental, and more — as well as more granular property types. (You can filter if you only want to stay in a yacht, for instance). While Airbnb also filters based on location type and property type, Vrbo's filters are more comprehensive and robust.\nFees\nAirbnb\nAirbnb charges both hosts and guests fees. Guests are typically charged five percent to 15 percent of the reservation subtotal. Meanwhile hosts are charged a 3 percent fee every time a booking is completed with Airbnb. And if you're hosting an experience, Airbnb will charge a 20 percent service fee.\nVrbo\nLike Airbnb, Vrbo also charges fees to both homeowners and guests. Guests are typically charged a 6 percent to 12 percent service fee. The service fee is more complicated for homeowners. To list a rental on Vrbo, they must pay a subscription fee. There are two primary subscription payment plans available for Vrbo hosts: pay-per-booking, in which hosts are charged 8 percent for each booking received through the site (Vrbo recommends this option for new renters or people who rent for less than six weeks per year) and an annual subscription payment, which charges homeowners a flat $499 fee up front for the year (The company recommends this option for year round hosts).\n\nSo which one should you choose?\nThat depends on which kind of trip you're looking for. Considering the flexibility of rental type, the extensive host network, and the suite of \"explore\" features, Airbnb may be better for anyone dedicated to a more adventurous trip.\nHowever, if you're committed for a full vacation, a true escape for yourself, Vrbo may be better suited for you. Of course, that's not a hard and fast rule, and each website offers a range of tools and rentals that'll help you book the dream trip.\nWATCH: This treehouse is actually a hotel room high up in a French forest"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F68728%252F7600a0a6-333b-4abf-8f28-3be24cab7245.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=pmuyA5aKRMIJOK5tOVKmG9ENI94=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F68728%252F7600a0a6-333b-4abf-8f28-3be24cab7245.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=3yByzBMfP5UgPGNGQCia_5r2VLY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F68728%252F7600a0a6-333b-4abf-8f28-3be24cab7245.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=no9PolkRlCGdXvIoPKe5vz_BZ5A=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F68728%252F7600a0a6-333b-4abf-8f28-3be24cab7245.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=eycMjYf1AeZDbc5ytH4sARkaRPQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Airbnb vs. Vrbo: Everything you need to know about both accommodation sites","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F68728%252F7600a0a6-333b-4abf-8f28-3be24cab7245.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=no9PolkRlCGdXvIoPKe5vz_BZ5A=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F68728%252F7600a0a6-333b-4abf-8f28-3be24cab7245.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=no9PolkRlCGdXvIoPKe5vz_BZ5A=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Airbnb vs. Vrbo: Everything you need to know about both accommodation sites","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"EmljxBv0L6","data-ytid":"cVpC1mMYpZA","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Here's what you need to know if you're deciding between Airbnb and Vrbo when booking a vacation.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","tweet_text":"Airbnb vs. Vrbo: Everything you need to know about both accommodation sites"},{"_id":"5dc53d10ca2f0c414400007c","id":"/roundup/best-sleep-masks-for-travel-bluetooth/","title":"Block out the world with the best Bluetooth sleep masks for travel","title_tag":null,"author":"Nah'Ja Washington","post_date":"2019-11-08T10:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 08 Nov 2019 10:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"11/08/2019","sort_key":"1ItbBO","link":"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-sleep-masks-for-travel-bluetooth/","content":{"plain":"Can you believe there was once a time when you used to dread sleeping?

Oftentimes, even having the best mattress or pillow isn't enough. Getting decent sleep is a constant source of frustration for travelers especially, as adjusting to a new bed or attempting to get a few winks in transit can prove quite challenging.\nDear reader, have you heard of technology?\nOne of our favorite innovations of the last few years is the Bluetooth eye mask. We're sure you're all familiar with its humble forefather, the basic eye mask?

Carry On is our series devoted to how we get away in the digital age, from the choices we make to the experiences we share.\n\nThe global fight against climate change has seen serious momentum of late, thanks in part to Greta Thunberg — inspiring millions to march against government inaction around the world is no mean feat. But there's a particular movement that the Swedish teen activist has also helped to popularise.\nIt's called 'flygskam.'\n'Flygskam' is Swedish for 'flight shame' and it's growing into a pretty formidable strategy. Thunberg wielded it when, instead of taking a flight from the UK to New York, she sailed across the Atlantic aboard a zero-emissions racing yacht this August. Her two-week expedition shed light on the immense impact commercial aviation has on climate change.\nIn 2018 alone, international air travel was responsible for 2.4 percent of global fossil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. While it may seem like an insignificant number, if commercial aviation were treated as a country it would be the sixth biggest fossil CO2 emitter in the world. To make matters more pressing, the growth of commercial aviation is exceeding expectations and with that, emissions attributed to it are on the up.\n\nBut where exactly does the term 'flygskam' come from? According to Ola Karlsson, a language advisor at the Swedish Language Council, 'flygskam' is a compound of 'flyg', which means flight, and 'skam' — shame. Together, the term embodies a feeling of guilt over taking flights.\n\"It's the feeling you have that your habit of flying is a morally reprehensible act from an environmental point of view,\" he told Mashable.\nAnd so far, it's working. BBC reports that according to a WWF survey, 23 percent of the Swedish population says it has altered its flying behavior since 'flygskam' entered the country's vocabulary. And although it's hard to directly associate that shift with the term itself, a new survey by Swiss bank UBS suggests that flying shame is indeed leading people to fly less, not just in Sweden but in the UK and the U.S. as well. \n\"New words like flygskam can convey some kind of message and indirectly influence our opinions,\" Karlsson said. \"At least in Sweden, train traveling has increased distinctly over the past year or so and flying has decreased.\"\nIn Sweden, the number of passengers embarking on domestic flights decreased by three percent in 2018. In the same year, SJ, a state-owned train operator, told Mashable in a statement that it carried two million more passengers than the year before — a six percent increase. The 2019 trends are also in favor of rail transport, with SJ reporting that it's seen customer numbers rising between 8-9 percent in the first half of the year.\nHow to avoid guilt trips\n\n'Flygskam' seems to have had an impact in Sweden, but is instilling this sense of shame around the world the right thing to do? After all, only a small percentage of the population is privileged enough to consider frequent flying a choice. \n\"A disproportionate amount of the flying is done by a relatively small group,\" Dan Rutherford, the aviation program director at the International Council on Clean Transportation, told Mashable. \n\"In countries like the UK and the United States, typically, about 15 percent of the population takes about 70 percent of the flights,\" he said. \"So if you're in that group, then probably you should be thinking about changing your behavior.\"\nIn simple terms, if you take more than five flights per year, cut it down. And even if you rarely board a plane, there are still things you can do to fly more efficiently. Or as Rutherford calls it, \"fly like a NERD,\" an acronym that stands for new, economy, regular, and direct. In essence, it means we should be trying to take direct flights in economy class, executed by regular-sized, newer airplanes.\n\nBut wait, can't you just offset your carbon emissions when booking your flight, by ticking that little box and donating to carbon reduction projects? It's a controversial topic, and is probably better than doing nothing. And sure, it might make you feel less guilty for flying, but according to Professor Susanne Becken, a professor of sustainable tourism at Griffith Institute for Tourism, \"a carbon offset helps to mitigate climate [change] elsewhere, but it does not negate emissions.\" \nThere are other options out there, Becken said, with a more immediate effect. These are what she calls 'insetting', in which you assume that you have a certain carbon budget which you are not supposed to exceed. \n\"If I take a flight, it will probably destroy my budget and I will have to try even harder in some of the areas, like swap my car for public transport or make sure my next trip is by rail,\" she said. \"In that sense, offsetting becomes \"insetting\" where I can invest resources (time and money) into activities that actually truly reduce carbon.\"\n\nThe NERD acronym, offsetting, and insetting are all good enough options to consider when you cannot actually make an informed decision about the most efficient flight that you could book. As Rutherford explains, airlines \"control basically every lever you need to reduce the carbon intensity of flying. [...] So it's really important that airlines and then governments move in the direction of better data disclosure.\" \nIn Sweden, changes in transparency are already being considered. \"There's been a proposal for airlines to disclose the carbon intensity of their flights within Sweden,\" Rutherford said. \"So that's a good example of a government that's taking positive steps in this direction.\"\nIt might not be too long before flight search engines are able to display flights with carbon labeling, which would make it easier for people to make informed choices when it comes to flying in the most fuel-efficient way possible. \nUntil then, it might be up to the power of 'flygskam' to get us flying like NERDs."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105238%252Fce7df1f2-150f-4128-a64f-cc934f4d7acf.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=TB_Q_Av2hRa9_SCkIlyPkjJb74o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105238%252Fce7df1f2-150f-4128-a64f-cc934f4d7acf.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=cSUZr6SERynTsxNIxMQY3h-rmew=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105238%252Fce7df1f2-150f-4128-a64f-cc934f4d7acf.png%252F280x158.png?signature=0EHOIiWVnJcw5Hb-oW6r1YQ-9zQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105238%252Fce7df1f2-150f-4128-a64f-cc934f4d7acf.png%252F560x316.png?signature=YvNlmaGjIDjkxpZIDHZq1_y1YJ0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Feeling the creep of ‘flygskam’?

While not a contagious and potentially-deadly disease, the process can cause headaches of its own.\nMy husband and I were set for a multi-city trip to Italy this month, flying Delta and staying at accommodations booked on Airbnb and Hotels.com. In late February, as the news of coronavirus' spread trickled in, we held steady, as we weren't planning to travel to the affected region in the north. For a fleeting moment, I imagined going to Italy and blissfully not dealing with crowds. Fast forward to this week and that daydream turned rotten. On Monday, all of Italy was put under lockdown by the government through April 3. Travel both inside and outside the country would be severely restricted as the case count jumped above 10,000.\nBy Tuesday, Delta had canceled all flights to Italy. It was time to get our money back.\nWhile we easily booked everything online, unraveling our reservations online was maddening — minus one bright spot, Airbnb. (To be clear, my fight for refunds is nothing compared to the rising death toll of more than 4,600 people. Yet, I'm not alone in being frustrated and confused by travel issues right now.) Here's how my irritating journey unfolded.\n\nHotels.com: Not on us\nWe had booked a five-night stay at a boutique hotel in Rome on Hotels.com, that was, unfortunately, non-refundable. Surely, I thought, Hotels.com wouldn't hold us to that since we couldn't get into the country? From what I could discern from the website, however, we seemed to be out of luck.\nWhen I clicked to cancel my reservation, I was informed I wouldn't get any money back because of the hotel's policy, and I may even be charged a fee for canceling at all. After some googling, I found the company's number (inconveniently absent from the website) and called in a huff. I waited on hold for more than an hour. A customer services agent told me it'd be up to the hotel to offer the refund and since it was 4 a.m. in Italy, another team member would call on my behalf during business hours to inquire. I'd get an email in 24 hours about the hotel's decision. At that point, it seemed like we may not get a refund.\nI was worried my case would get lost in the onslaught of coronavirus-related calls, so I emailed the hotel asking for help. A few hours later, a hotel representative responded that they'd be happy to give me a refund, but that was actually up to Hotels.com. \"Please contact Hotels.com for more information,\" they wrote.\nAhhhhh!\nBy 10 p.m. that evening, I still hadn't gotten an email from Hotels.com. So I called back, armed with the email from the hotel. After about 45 minutes on hold,  I spoke to a customer service representative who asked some questions, put me on hold, asked more questions, put me on hold, and then finally said I'd get my $1,200 back. Hallelujah! \nA Hotels.com spokesperson reiterated over email that \"refunds are at the discretion of our hotel partners, and we are doing our best to work with them to make exceptions to policies. We’re working to find resolutions for customers as soon as we can in this unprecedented situation.\"\nSure, but the best type of resolution would happen fully online. Especially if the hotel was already offering refunds.\nDelta: Sorry, technical issues\nBefore the nationwide clampdown on Monday, Delta announced it would waive fees if you rescheduled a flight, but online it was still charging me $330 to make the change. By Tuesday, the airline said it was canceling all flights to Italy. \"In the event your selected flight is canceled by Delta, we will contact you with additional information,\" its FAQ page on the coronavirus reads. We never got an email or a call from Delta that our flight had been canceled, even though every flight to Italy had been. \nWhen I tried to modify our flights on Delta's website Wednesday morning, the feature wasn't working. I called customer service as suggested and was told I could wait on the line for up to four hours or I could get a call back. I opted for the latter. Then I never got a call back. I tried the modify tool again in the afternoon; it was still broken.\n\nA Delta spokesperson blamed the malfunction on a technical issue over email. I checked again Thursday morning and was indeed able to cancel my flight with a refund through the modify feature, but if I wanted to reschedule I'd have to call. \n\nAirbnb: We got you, with conditions\nIf Hotels.com and Delta want to learn how this ordeal should've been handled, they should take a page from Airbnb. Airbnb has other problems, but its coronavirus response has been exemplary, at least when it comes to customers traveling to China, Italy, and South Korea. For those booked elsewhere, the company hasn't been as helpful.\nI was never really worried about our two Airbnb reservations because we had a few more days before they were no longer fully refundable. But when I logged on to actually cancel the reservations, I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. In a prominent spot at the top of both the reservations were notifications that I'd get a full refund due to the novel coronavirus. That was the case for any Airbnb customers staying in Italy (so long as you had 48 hours before check-in, otherwise you'd have to work it out with the host). I proceeded to cancel my reservation and moments later, I was done. I didn't need to call a soul, wait on hold, or furiously write an email. The next day, I even got a call from Airbnb informing me of their new cancellation policy.\n\nIn the year 2020, we are deep into the internet age. No one should be forced to go hunt for a number, wait on hold, get the run-around, and then wait on hold again another day to cancel a trip due to a pandemic.\nBooking sites have the ability to, like Airbnb, flag all the reservations impacted by coronavirus travel restrictions with an informative, calming notification. They just choose not to. Or they can't get organized enough to make it happen swiftly. And that's a shame.\nAfter all this, there's still one more website blocking us from getting a refund: the Vatican. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1242366%252F7f3e7793-4738-46db-a806-69b3af03c8d8.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=u1yIF5gHxWMZH-JVFjsq6vY_7N4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111872%252Fd232eab7-f875-4a9d-8525-3c72df420daa.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=y4Z5Uns5ihoehKm6F-gVQEYXg84=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111872%252Fd232eab7-f875-4a9d-8525-3c72df420daa.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=nc1hKyizh0kTj4NkmG9_z5Uh1W8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111872%252Fd232eab7-f875-4a9d-8525-3c72df420daa.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=hAY_AGA56tHdSFM4vguP_Nimtcc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111872%252Fd232eab7-f875-4a9d-8525-3c72df420daa.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=IP3mv6IjXpFKJuhmh54Beaj9HF4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111872%252Fd232eab7-f875-4a9d-8525-3c72df420daa.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=V6EMmAPaRbT7f70SB9uqI4B4xSw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"That could've been me stranded in the Santa Maria Novella railway station in Florence.

Right now, I’m wedged into economy seats in the butt of a plane. It’s not the most comfortable experience, but the perfect pair of kicks (and maybe a few mimosas) lightens the load.\nThe right gear is important to smooth sailing, and even spontaneous types should come prepared. As you come out of winter hibernation, check out our compilation of the best travel gadgets. Look at our picks for pet accessories perfect for vacation. If you like to stay connected at all times, check out our favorite smart luggage. \nEven if you don’t need to track your dog’s every step or charge your phone from your suitcase, chances are you’ll need shoes. And you need to put a lot of thought into those shoes.\nTo tromp through the terminals, I like a comfy pair of shoes. Slip-ons are my favorite for a quick run through security. Plus, don’t forget socks. Otherwise, you’ll be putting your bare feet on the scanner after thousands of strangers.\nYour perfect pair depends on your trip. Off the beaten path, you’ll need a heavy-duty shoe. If you’re packing light, look for something that can lay flat in your carry on. Beach trips need flip-flops.\nThink of the terrain. Will you be along old, uneven brick sidewalks? Look for pairs that protect from stubbed toes and thicker soles. For camping and hiking, look for traction and a stiff ankle to keep you from sprains.\nThe best fit should be snug but with wiggle room. Check for any rubbing or friction as you walk. If you have rounder bunions, aim for a wide-fit shoe or one with straps that avoid the problem area. Not every shoe will be made for your feet’s proportions.\nFor this roundup, I went shopping. I picked up so much footwear, pressed into the insole, bounced around, and sauntered around the stores. I also ordered myself a pair of Allbirds, all in the name of research (and maybe a bit of consumerism).\nI also asked in Facebook groups dedicated to fibromyalgia, a chronic illness I’ve dealt with for a few years. Those of us with nerve pain are experts in comfort, and our feet are really sensitive.

I raised my heavy head from the wet floor. \"Yep,\" I mustered in response. As I parted my lips to speak, I tasted something metallic — blood. \n\"Rachel?\" the voice repeated. \"Open the door.\" \nI have no recollection of unlocking the door. All I remember is the cloud of confusion that engulfed me as I sat on the edge of bed trying jog my short term memory. \"We're in Morocco,\" my friend told me, in response to my question about our whereabouts. \"Marrakech, to be precise,\" he added, his face full of worry. \nAt some point during that hour locked inside the hostel bathroom, I'd had a seizure. It wasn't the first, nor was it the last I'd have, but it was certainly the first time my epilepsy had reared its head when I was traveling. My cheekbone was throbbing. It would later turn into a bruise, a souvenir from hitting it on the edge of the shower pedestal. I couldn't remember the last 24 hours of my life. I couldn't remember flying thousands of miles from home, how our flight had been delayed, how we spent the night lying on the cold hard airport floor. \nThose memories flooded back an hour later. I recalled arriving at the hostel and attempting to nap. Awaking with a start, my thoughts felt jumbled, like a disordered Rolodex. \nThen my limbs started jerking involuntarily. With each twitch, I drew in a sharp intake of breath that sounded like a shocked gasp. It'll pass, I thought. Those twitches were my body warning me that a seizure was coming. For some unfathomable reason, I didn't heed the warning on that occasion. I got up to take a shower and locked the door behind me. \nWhat I learned was how to travel with epilepsy.\nThat day I realised my epilepsy wasn't the greatest travel companion. I wasn't born with epilepsy, I had my first seizure at age 16. And from that moment on, my life became a hazardous obstacle course — the only reward was new knowledge of my own limits. \nThose limits, I learned, were my seizure triggers — sleep deprivation, excessive alcohol, stress, and traveling long distances. The latter was a limit I was in no hurry to accept. I figured I could do my utmost to ensure I got enough sleep, be careful with booze, and manage my stress levels. But to stop traveling? No. \n\nI did not stop traveling. \nI was determined to make sure that seizure in Morocco didn't ruin my trip. I rested up, got plenty of sleep, but we went for walks and explored the city. When I was feeling strong again, we went trekking in the Atlas Mountains. Then we went to the Sahara Desert. \nThere would be more seizures on hotel bathroom floors. More sleepless nights in airports. There'd be near-misses, too. All of them, lessons learned the hard way. \nWhat I learned was how to travel with epilepsy. Now, if I'm in a different time zone, I set an alarm on my phone to make sure I take my anticonvulsant medication at the exact time I take it every night when I'm home. I make sure I bring more than double the amount of medication I need for the trip and split the packets equally into my hand luggage and hold luggage. I avoid booking flights when I have my period, as my menstrual cycle has been known to affect my seizures. If I'm taking a long-haul flight, I pack Valerian tablets and a sleep mask to make sure I sleep on the plane. That failing, I go to sleep straight away when I arrive at my accommodation. The first few days, I let myself sleep late or take naps if I need to. If I start twitching, I stay in bed in the hope that they'll pass.\n\nWhatever I do, I won't let my epilepsy stand in the way of my travel plans.\nI'm not alone in this. Sophie Heilbron, 26, was diagnosed with Jeavons Syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy, when she was seven years old. \"I think I was a bit too young to realise at the time the impact it would have on my life, but as I’ve got older I’ve started to learn a lot more about the condition as well as how I’m able to deal with it,\" she told me. \n\"For as long as I can remember, travel has always been a passion of mine,\" she said. \"I didn’t want my epilepsy to affect that.\" Heilbron said that every time she had a seizure she learnt something about herself. \"One occurred after a heavy night of drinking with very little sleep, another occurred when I had the flu and had to sit some school exams,\" she explained. \"I quickly realised that stress, tiredness and dehydration were common triggers.\"\nAt the age of 18, she had finished Sixth Form (high school in the UK), and she booked a girls' trip to Zante, Greece. \"Realistically I knew that alcohol would be on the cards and sleep would be precious, so I actually wrote a three page booklet for the other seven girls going with me called Sophie’s Guide to Epilepsy so that in the unlikely scenario that I did have a seizure, they would know what to do,\" she said. \n\"Waking up after the first night of the trip, I knew I wasn’t feeling great but wanted to make the most of the Greek sunshine so I went out to the sun lounger by the pool and within 10 minutes was having a seizure,\" she recalled. Her friends handled the situation and made sure she wasn't in any danger. Once she'd regained consciousness in her bed, her friends told her what had happened, they called her parents, and they went to the local hospital to make sure she was OK. \nSEE ALSO: How I’ve learned to live with an invisible illness\n\"I think in a lot of scenarios, that would’ve put me off traveling but no, it did the opposite, I realised that as long as I’m around people who are aware, then I’ll be in safe hands,\" she said. \"Since then, I’ve lived on my own in Australia for over a year and try and take as many trips now I’m living back in London including solo travel to Vietnam and Mexico.\"\nThrough identifying her seizure triggers, Heilborn has learned her limits. If she's had a long day of traveling, she knows she needs to sleep. If she doesn't feel great, she stays indoors. She always carries sunglasses, a sunhat, and emergency medication with her wherever she goes. \n\"Personally, I believe that as long as you feel comfortable and feel as though you’re able to make people aware of your situation, living with epilepsy shouldn’t stop you from doing anything that you’re capable of,\" she said. \n\"Epilepsy shouldn’t stop you from doing anything that you’re capable of.\"\nHeilborn also makes a point of telling people she meets while traveling that she has epilepsy just in case she has a seizure, and lets them know what they should do. In the event of a seizure, she has her medications listed under her medical ID on her phone too. \"I’m never going to stop traveling and I get such a sense of freedom when I’m alone in another country,\" she told me. \"As long as I feel safe, then I know I’m going to have a great time.\"\nHaving epilepsy doesn't have to be a barrier to traveling overseas, according to Chantal Spittles, of the UK nonprofit Epilepsy Action. \"It’s important to consider how long you’ll be away for and speak to your doctor about getting more medication than you’ll normally need,\" said Spittles. \"This will make a huge difference in the unfortunate case it gets lost or stolen, or your return trip is delayed.\"\nThe summer after my travels to Morocco, I spent two months working in New Hampshire, in the U.S. Those months were seizure-free, but as I was packing to travel around Cape Cod, Massachusetts, I couldn't find a week's worth of medication. The missing packets of pills were needed to get me through the rest of the trip and I couldn't risk not taking my medication. \nI got advice from a nurse at my place of work, and I ended up having to go to hospital to get a prescription for the missing anticonvulsants. Neither the hospital nor the pharmacy would accept my travel insurance paperwork. When I returned to the UK, my travel insurance company refused to reimburse me. It was a costly, upsetting ordeal that I hope to never repeat. As Spittles told me: \"It’s also important to make sure you have travel insurance as the cost of medical care and treatment can be very expensive outside the UK.\" \n\"If there’s a time difference, think about what time you’ll need to take your medication to minimise the risk of seizures,\" added Spittles. I learned that lesson the hard way when I travelled to the U.S. a few years ago and didn't take my medication at the usual time. Instead, I rather stupidly had drinks with friends and took my medication at 2 a.m. EST — many hours after I should have done. The next morning, I had a seizure. Ever since, I've been extremely strict with myself about taking medication at a set time while traveling.\nEpilepsy isn't the only neurological condition that can make traveling more challenging, according to Dr. Fizzah Ali, a neurology registrar at the NHS Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, London. Conditions like migraines, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and other neurological conditions can make traveling more complicated. \"As someone with a neurological condition you are an expert of sorts. Through your lived experience you will have an idea of your symptom set, the factors which help manage it, and the factors which trigger your neurological condition. Keep these in mind when planning your travel abroad,\" Ali said. \nWhile our bodies and neurological conditions are individual, she shared some general advice that can make traveling with a neurological condition less stressful. \"These include managing hydration, meals times, fatigue and sleep, as well as avoiding recreational drug use including excess alcohol, whilst traveling,\" said Ali. \"Discuss your plans with your GP, neurologist, or specialist nurse. You may also wish to consider informing relevant parties such as the airline about your condition.\" \nEpilepsy Action has a list of useful advice for traveling with epilepsy. The Epilepsy Society also has a great list on its website. \nWhen I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was a teenager, I could never have imagined traveling the world. But with each seizure, I learned something new about my condition and how I might be able to prevent seizures. Since then, I've lived abroad in France, Kenya, and the U.S.. I've travelled throughout Africa, Asia, North America, and across Europe. \nLying on that bathroom floor in Morocco, I feared the worst: that this would be the last holiday I'd go on.

There are fewer people at airports around the world as the new coronavirus disease spreads throughout cities. In some of the areas hardest hit by the virus like China, South Korea, and Italy, travel is restricted and it's definitely noticeable.\nFor the airline industry, this is a major blow. Carriers like United, Delta, and Alaska are changing cancellation policies to allow free flight changes for the next year. The International Air Transport Association puts losses anywhere from $63 billion to $113 billion, depending on the spread of the respiratory disease.\nThe San Francisco International Airport spokesperson Doug Yakel explained that February numbers from airlines won't come in until the end of March, but flight schedules have been drastically reduced. Flights to China, Hong Kong, South Korean, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan from SFO went from 204 planned for each week in March to 99 flights, marking over a 50 percent drop. \nSo while travel is still happening (note travel restrictions for certain countries), the regular hustle and bustle is tempered. Take a look at airports in recent weeks compared to activity before the COVID-19 (coronavirus' official name) outbreak. In some places, airports remain fairly busy, but travelers are masking up and taking precautions.\nBeijing's Daxing International Airport \n\nHong Kong International Airport\n\nTianhe airport in

Hotels and other accommodations aren't always clear about how accessible they are and the adaptive equipment needed to participate in certain activities can be expensive or difficult to obtain.  \nThis is where the online travel marketplace Wheel the World comes in. The website connects people all over the world who have physical disabilities with customizable tour packages, depending on the person's needs. \nAlmost 14 percent of Americans have a physical disability affecting their mobility, according to the CDC. In 2015, 26 million U.S. travelers with disabilities took a total of 73 million trips, according to the 2015 market study by Open Doors, a nonprofit that publishes research on the disability travel market. Yet, many trips and destinations aren't disability-friendly. \nToday Wheel the World offers customers over 30 accessible destinations in the U.S. and abroad, Alvaro Silberstein, the company's founder, says.  \nThis also includes accommodations while traveling, such as hotels, apartments, motels, and trip activities. \nThey've served almost 900 people with physical disabilities, their family, and friends.\n\nTravelers can sign up for trips to destinations such as New York City, Hawaii, Paris, London, Machu Picchu, and even safaris in Kruger National Park in South Africa or Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.\nTrip packages can include adaptive equipment such as amphibious wheelchairs, which can be used on the beach, in a pool, and in the ocean, and adaptive kayaks, which can help those with various physical disabilities to kayak.\nSilberstein says there are some trips that are appropriate for people who are blind, though Wheel the World focuses on people with mobility issues. \nIn the future, they plan to include trips for people with hearing loss, and people with emotional disabilities, Silberstein says.\nCustomers can fill out a form on Wheel the World's website, detailing where they wish to go and the type of accommodations they require. \n\nSilberstein, who has gotten around in wheelchair since a drunk driver hit him when he was was 18, founded Wheel the World with his friend Camilo Navarro. The duo filmed Silberstein touring Torres del Paine in Chile in a trekking wheelchair, covering about 30 miles of terrain in five days. After they published these videos, Silberstein and Navarro were flooded with requests from strangers who wanted to duplicate the trip. \nSEE ALSO: He's legally blind, so he makes self-driving car sensors to 'see'\nOne of the biggest barriers for travelers with physical disabilities is finding information about accessible trips, Silberstein says, a gap Wheel the World aims to close.\n\nSilberstein's team checks the accessibility of accommodations themselves, evaluating things such as door widths, bed heights, if elevators are present and functioning, and bathrooms' accessibility. \nWheel the World partners with tour operators and hotels to provide travelers with physical disabilities and their families with accessible trips. \nIn 2018, Wheel the World partnered with Peak DMC, a tour operator that is a division of Intrepid Group. Intrepid Group's website claims they are \"the world’s largest adventure travel company.\" \nSilberstein convinced Peak DMC to focus on accessibility by emphasizing the number of people with physical disabilities globally. \nWheel the World is working to expand tours in Europe -- currently their website lists London and Paris as the only destinations on the continent, but their eventual goal is much loftier.  \n\"We want to allow millions of people to travel to thousands of destinations,\" Silberstein says."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1192667%252Fd5b83f29-bed1-489a-885d-635213a2c5be.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=WKcEfzwN8v2PkVukB21aiZWMhBM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103924%252F5a82af52-2bee-4871-a583-36b75d66df08.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=0OpA9plzXgqdE5hWOiKHWWyA2XY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103924%252F5a82af52-2bee-4871-a583-36b75d66df08.png%252F356x205.png?signature=8hd66eB72QJbjT3GPRhsJg2rRqs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103924%252F5a82af52-2bee-4871-a583-36b75d66df08.png%252F712x410.png?signature=qleyHDIsSMu7tMXjYkKwyrUhYzw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103924%252F5a82af52-2bee-4871-a583-36b75d66df08.png%252F280x157.png?signature=jezbI5iWNqwWDlEVM4YqFaIEWP8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103924%252F5a82af52-2bee-4871-a583-36b75d66df08.png%252F560x314.png?signature=mLJ8FseVyQQ1JnI-EbXhCljl_fk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Wheel the World vets accessible trips for people with disabilities.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-wheel-the-world-accessible-travel.png","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-wheel-the-world-accessible-travel.png","micro":1},"src_type":"png","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1192667%252Fd5b83f29-bed1-489a-885d-635213a2c5be.png%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=AxtCSlx1P1AMJ_ZY4Sop_yYGEUg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1192667%252Fd5b83f29-bed1-489a-885d-635213a2c5be.png%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=yp7lexzNmOwmSGBfFhkALg92rrY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Wheel the World vets accessible trips for people with disabilities."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  WHEEL THE WORLD / BOB AL GREENE / MASHABLE"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Wheel the World helps people with physical disabilities enjoy their vacations","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The company offers trips to over 30 destinations, vetted for accessibility.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Social Good","channel_label":"Social Good","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Social%20Good/","sponsored_by":"","sponsored_by_url":"","order_number":"","tweet_text":"Wheel the World helps people with physical disabilities enjoy their vacations"},{"_id":"5e5d03c228cc3613ea000001","id":"/article/compass-iphone-app-travel-offline-hack/","title":"The best travel app is an iPhone feature you're probably ignoring","title_tag":null,"author":"Sasha Lekach","post_date":"2020-03-02T13:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 02 Mar 2020 13:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"03/02/2020","sort_key":"1J8Nu1","link":"https://mashable.com/article/compass-iphone-app-travel-offline-hack/","content":{"plain":"{\"player\":{\"description\":\"Do you ever use it?

I was one of those people who didn't really think often about cardinal directions until I started traveling abroad earlier this year and found myself with limited data on my monthly plan. It was time to get creative.\nHave you ever wanted to delete the compass app? But you are paranoid that you might get lost in the forest, desert, or ocean so you keep it? Because, same.— Hanna Kim (@hannakimmysmile) January 3, 2020\n\nThe handy trick of using Google Maps' GPS tracker with your phone data turned off is a life-saver, but that little blue dot showing where you are and what direction you're moving is fairly tiny. My Compass app hack points you in the right direction in a big, bold font and also works without data or internet.\nI realized I could map out my upcoming route when I had WiFi on a mapping app (Google Maps, always) and then, once out of the subway station or cab or front door, use my internet-disconnected phone to tell me if I was walking in the direction of my destination.\nSEE ALSO: Traveling without phone service? These offline tools can help.\nAs a friend pointed out, the app doesn't tell you exactly where you are, but it helps orient you. No matter how remote the location, it will tell you your bearings, coordinates, and elevation. While in the Chilean desert I was fascinated to learn that, at one point, I was at 13,000 feet. So that's why it was so hard to breathe! As someone who usually lives at sea level, it was cool to get a sense of elevation gain. I checked the compass frequently during a long drive.\nFor a journey to a famous sandwich shop in central Santiago, I knew I'd have to head east-ish once above ground from the metro. Coming up from underground is the most disorienting experience — I always pretend to know that I've picked the right way, but I'm just confidently guessing. Instead, I subtly pulled out the Compass app and, boom, I actually knew to turn right and not left. I was eating lunch in no time, not doubling back after walking a few blocks in the wrong direction.\n\nEven if you haven't pre-mapped your route, the compass app can still be helpful. If someone gives you vague directions (\"It's towards San Cristobal hill\" or any big landmark that you know is at the top of the city or a few neighborhoods below you) or if you just have a general idea that your destination is in a certain part of town, this app can make sure you're on the right path. \nIt's no Google Maps (even in offline mode), but it's quick, easy, and I know where I'm going, without using any data."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111381%252F734a437c-9cd5-4e9d-836d-dbddcb8012dd.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=g7u-P0PxkWvMiDFwcAqUzzNQF2k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111381%252F734a437c-9cd5-4e9d-836d-dbddcb8012dd.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=2z5TxX40dQeNDATTOjfETT1mY9s=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111381%252F734a437c-9cd5-4e9d-836d-dbddcb8012dd.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=3mRUEE4qItIVVXbv7xN7PShES2w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111381%252F734a437c-9cd5-4e9d-836d-dbddcb8012dd.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=qFkUg_XG47ELDUq-L5-GfAbimHQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111381%252F734a437c-9cd5-4e9d-836d-dbddcb8012dd.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=t4VCf1RSPIeUCqcHR6y6mI7pcOo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111381%252F734a437c-9cd5-4e9d-836d-dbddcb8012dd.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=WXNDShw3M978kBtAqF0_yrXeI9E=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"The best travel app is an iPhone feature you're probably ignoring","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111381%252F734a437c-9cd5-4e9d-836d-dbddcb8012dd.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=3mRUEE4qItIVVXbv7xN7PShES2w=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111381%252F734a437c-9cd5-4e9d-836d-dbddcb8012dd.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=t4VCf1RSPIeUCqcHR6y6mI7pcOo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111381%252F734a437c-9cd5-4e9d-836d-dbddcb8012dd.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=3mRUEE4qItIVVXbv7xN7PShES2w=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"The best travel app is an iPhone feature you're probably ignoring","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"I was lost, but now I am found.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","sponsored_by":"","sponsored_by_url":"","order_number":"","tweet_text":"The best travel app is an iPhone feature you're probably ignoring"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":5631}
