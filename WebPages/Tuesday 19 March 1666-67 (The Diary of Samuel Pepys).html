        <h1> Tuesday 19 March 1666/67 </h1> 
        <p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where we sat all the morning. At noon dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> very pleasantly with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, and after dinner with a great deal of pleasure had her sing, which she begins to do with some pleasure to me, more than I expected. Then to the office again, where all the afternoon close, and at night home to supper and to bed. It comes in my mind this night to set down how a house was the other day in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2191/">Bishopsgate Street</a> blowed up with powder; a house that was untenanted, and between a flax shop and a —————-, both bad for fire; but, thanks be to God, it did no more hurt; and all do conclude it a plot. I would also remember to my shame how I was pleased yesterday, to find the righteous maid of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1529/">Magister Griffin</a> sweeping of ‘nostra’ office, ‘elle con the Roman nariz and bonne’ body which I did heretofore like, and do still refresh me to think ‘que elle’ is come to us, that I may ‘voir her aliquando’. This afternoon I am told again that the town do talk of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington’s</a> being to be Lord Treasurer, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> to be Secretary of State; and that for certain the match is concluded between the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6590/">Duke of Richmond</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/">Mrs. Stewart</a>, which I am well enough pleased with; and it is pretty to consider how his quality will allay people’s talk; whereas, had a meaner person married her, he would for certain have been reckoned a cuckold at first-dash.</p>

         <p>Following a quick check the Wheatley text, the one used here, follows the convention: _____ for an ellipsis in SP's text and ..... for cuts made by Wheatley himself. However, on occasion, there are omitted single words or short passages to whose absence / excision Wheatley makes no allusion -- I don't know if these are in fact defects in the Mynors Bright transcription and notes from which Wheatley worked, L&amp;M describe Wheatley with the euphemism 'a worker of random habits.' </p>

         <p>Damning with faint praise, all Sam can find to say about Elizabeth's postprandial performance is that her singing "begins" to please him "more than [he] expected." </p> 
         <p>I feel very sorry for her -- she's trying pitifully hard to achieve and please -- but trying to sing when one doesn't have the pipes is like beating a dead horse, and Elizabeth, bless her heart, just doesn't have the pipes. </p> 
         <p>Tom, Barker, Mercer, and esp. Sam's "Barbary Allen," aka Diana Crisp, obviously do, and they, by simple gift, have it in them to please Sam when all her trying -- e.g., to learn to trill -- can never come to anything. <br> <br> </p>

         <p>and that for certain the match is concluded between the Duke of Richmond and Mrs. Stewart, which I am well enough pleased with; and it is pretty to consider how his quality will allay people’s talk; whereas, had a meaner person married her, he would for certain have been reckoned a cuckold at first-dash."</p> 
         <p>Maybe a spoiler (not sure). The Duke of Richmond and Frances actually had a daring plan where they ran away and eloped. I do not know the exact date that their marriage takes place (but it's around this time). I don't know if Sam's comment about the marriage being 'concluded' means that they actually did get married. This marriage was never sanctioned by the King, which would have been customary at this time. </p> 
         <p>(This is a spoiler, but Sam won’t have the details on this) The King is devastated by this elopement and did not easily get over this. With all of the mistresses that he took over the years, Frances, who never gave in to his advances, totally broke his heart. He struggled with this loss well into the summer, as seen in his correspondence to his sister Minette. Considering his ego and need to rationalize that Frances would leave him, the King looked for someone to blame for convincing her to marry. The cabals and the politics worked against Lord Clarendon as the usual Court backstabbers (Lady Castlemaine, Lord Buckingham, Lord Arlington, etc. jumped on this opportunity to blame Clarendon for this marriage. The devastated King will turned against him, and will then stacked the deck to go after him. Sam will see the results of this, but will not see the politics behind this. </p>

         <p>L&amp;M: A newsletter of 16 March (PRO, SP 29/194, no. 23) reported that the fire had occurred at about 4 a.m. on the 14th, and that the house was near Bishopsgate St. The writer (Henry Muddiman) added that 'it being seated advantageously to promote a second fire [it] doth confirm the Jealousy of such who believe the former was begun by designe'.</p>
