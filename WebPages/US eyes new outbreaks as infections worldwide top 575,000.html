        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">NEW ORLEANS (AP) — New Orleans rushed to build a makeshift hospital in its convention center Friday as troubling new outbreaks bubbled in the United States, deaths surged in Italy and Spain and the world warily trudged through the pandemic that has sickened more than a half-million people.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Punctuating the fact that no one is immune to the new coronavirus, it pierced even the highest echelons of global power, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson becoming the first leader of a major country to test positive.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">While New York remained the worst hit in the U.S., Americans braced for worsening conditions elsewhere, with worrisome infection numbers being reported in cities including New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit.</p>

        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“We are not through this. We’re not even half-way through this,” said Joseph Kanter of the Louisiana Department of Health, which has recorded more than 2,700 cases, more than five times what it had a week ago.</p>

        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">New Orleans’ sprawling Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, along the Mississippi River, was being converted into a massive hospital as officials prepared for thousands more patients than they could accommodate. The preparations immediately conjured images of another disaster, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the convention center became a squalid shelter of last resort in a city that has braved a string of storm hits, not to mention great fires and a yellow fever epidemic in centuries past.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">As the new health crisis loomed, economic catastrophe had already arrived in the city, where many already live in poverty and the tourism industry has screeched to a halt.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“I’ve never been unemployed. But now, all of a sudden: Wop!” said John Moore, the musician best known as Deacon John, who has no gigs to perform with much of the city shut down. “It ain’t just me. It’s everybody.” </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Italy recorded its single biggest rise in deaths, with 969 more victims, to bring its total number of fatalities to 9,134. The country now has 86,498 cases, surpassing China to record the grim distinction of the second-most infections in the world, behind the U.S.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Italian epidemiologists warn that the country’s number of cases is likely much higher than reported — perhaps by five times — although two weeks into a nationwide lockdown the daily increase seems to be slowing, at least in northern Italy.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“It’s a horrible sensation, not being able to breathe,” said Fausto Russo, a 38-year-old fitness trainer who is one of 10,000 Italians whose infection has been cured. “Imagine putting your head under water.”</p>

        </div>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Spain’s Health Ministry reported another 7,800 infections for a total of 64,059. Deaths climbed by 769 to 4,858 — the world’s second-highest total after Italy’s 8,214 fatalities.</p>

        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Spain says 9,444 health workers have contracted the coronavirus. That’s nearly 15% of the total number of cases.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“It’s true that we have more deaths than what we saw yesterday, but it’s also true that the percentage increase today is similar to that of the past three days and it appears there is a stabilization,” said Fernando Simón, the head of Spain’s health emergency coordination center.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The British prime minister’s office said Johnson was tested after showing mild symptoms for the coronavirus and that he is self-isolating and continuing to lead Britain’s response to the pandemic.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team, to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,” <a class="" href="/f5ab118e48bafb8f8919e332e0ac0114">Johnson said in a video </a><!-- --> message, adding that he had a temperature and persistent cough. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Several weeks ago, Johnson had pledged he would “go on shaking hands with everybody.”</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Johnson, 55, was the first leader of a major nation known to have contracted COVID-19; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been in isolation since her doctor tested positive for the virus, but her first two tests have been negative. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Earlier this week Britain’s Prince Charles said he had tested positive.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">British Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has been at the forefront of the nation’s response to the outbreak, also was confirmed to have the virus. Britain has 11,658 confirmed cases and 578 people have died.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">In Washington, the House rushed a $2.2 trillion recovery package to President Donald Trump, approving the sweeping measure by voice vote. Lawmakers in both parties lined up behind the measure to send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">The U.S. now has 85,996 confirmed cases, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Italy, the U.S.. and China account for nearly half the world’s more than 575,000 infections and more than half of the roughly 26,000 reported virus deaths.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Analysts warned that all those infection figures could be low for reasons that varied in each nation.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“China numbers can’t be trusted because the government lies,” American political scientist Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group think-tank, said in a tweet. “U.S. numbers can’t be trusted because the government can’t produce enough tests.”</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Johns Hopkins reported more than 128,000 people have recovered, about half in China.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">New York state, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, reported 100 more deaths in one day, accounting for almost 30% of the 1,300 fatalities nationwide. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the number of deaths will increase soon as critically ill patients who have been on ventilators for days succumb. </p>

        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">“That is a situation where people just deteriorate over time,” Cuomo said. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Around the world, the pandemic threatened people living in places with little means to respond.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">India launched a massive program to feed hungry day laborers after a lockdown of the country’s 1.3 billion people put them out of work. Iran’s military hurriedly finished a 2,000-bed field hospital to accommodate the worst outbreak in the Mideast. In Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South Africa and elsewhere, the count of the infected passed 1,000 people and worries persisted that it would only get worse.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">In China, where the virus was first believed to have started, the National Health Commission on Friday reported 55 new cases, 54 of them imported infections. Once again, there were no new cases reported in Wuhan, the provincial capital where the coronavirus first emerged in December. China is barring most foreigners from entering.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">In a phone call Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Trump that China “understands the United States’ current predicament over the COVID-19 outbreak and stands ready to provide support within its capacity,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the outbreak as a “Chinese virus,” struck a different tone Friday, tweeting after the call that “China has been through much &amp; has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!”</p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Beijing has strongly protested U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s repeated references to the outbreak as the “Wuhan Flu,” saying that promotes bias against China and Chinese Americans. </p>
        <p class="Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70">Shares skidded early Friday in Europe after a mixed day in Asia, where Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 jumped while Australia’s benchmark sank 5%. On <a class="" href="/2d9e4904307e5d1c18ecba79c2dabb1a">Wall Street</a><!-- -->, major indexes were down about 3%, giving up some of the gains the market had piled up over the previous three days.</p>

Mario Carminati, who has turned over a church in the tiny Lombard town of Seriate to host coffins before they are taken by military convoy to be cremated. This week, dozens were lined up in two neat rows down the central aisle, and were immediately replaced by new ones when they were taken away.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“At least the relatives and family know that someone is taking care of them, with a prayer and a benediction before they are taken away,’’ he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite the toll, officials have also expressed cautious optimism that the exponential spread of the virus is starting to slow in the hard-hit north, thanks to two weeks of military-enforced stay-at-home orders. For several days this week, new infections and deaths showed signs of slowing down, and emergency rooms weren’t seeing the tsunami of sick that characterized the first weeks of the pandemic following Italy's first positive test Feb. 20.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The numbers are still high, but for a few days now the numbers have stopped rising, thank God,” said Dr. Luca Lorini, head of intensive care at the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo, one of the hardest hit of Italy’s public hospitals. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some 500 medical personnel at the hospital are infected, and Lorini said he has found himself treating colleagues, friends, children of friends and parents of friends in his overwhelmed 88-bed ICU that serves a city of 120,000. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He marvels that he is still standing and wonders if maybe he was infected early on with slight symptoms and developed immunity. Nationwide, at least 50 doctors have died and 6,414 medical personnel have tested positive\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We know it before we go into battle, and we accept it,” Lorini told The Associated Press.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Elsewhere in Bergamo, the Italian army’s Alpini mountaineering forces are building a field hospital to be staffed, in part, by some of the 150 medical personnel sent by Russia, one of only a handful of countries along with China and Cuba to respond to Italy’s urgent appeal for medical equipment, protective masks and personnel. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But the need is also growing in the south, where hospitals are even less prepared and equipped than the prosperous north. In one week, Puglia in the “heel\" of the Italian peninsula went from 478 cases to 1,182, with a doubling of ICU patients. Campania also doubled its caseload to 1,310 and tripled the number of people in ICUs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a matter of hours, not days,” the governor of the Campania region that includes Naples wrote to the central government, complaining that his urgent requests for ventilators had gone unheeded. “There is a real chance of adding a tragedy of the south to the tragedy of the north.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cateno De Luca, mayor of the Sicilian city of Messina, took the extraordinary step of recording a warning to residents in his nasal, gravelly voice for drones to play as they fly over the seaside city monitoring residents’ movements. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Don’t go outside! That is an order from Mayor De Luca!” the drone blasts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Italy’s high death toll and the virus' aggressive spread in the country has led Italian epidemiologists to estimate that the true number of infected people could be as high as 450,000 and to say that under-testing is putting Italians at risk of infection. Currently, Italy only tests people showing symptoms, because its labs cannot process any more, and to date nearly 395,000 tests have been performed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Virologist Dr. Andrea Crisanti, director of molecular medicine at the University of Padua and a consultant for the Veneto regional government, points to the only controlled epidemiological study done in the outbreak, in the tiny Veneto town of Vo’Euganeo, as evidence that Italy’s true numbers of infection are much higher — and that the risk of not testing more widely is enormous.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Italy recorded its first death in Vo, and the town was locked down Feb. 22 and the entire population of 3,300 tested. According to the study, 3% of Vo’s residents were infected, but between 50%-75% of them were asymptomatic. But because all positive cases were identified, isolated and quarantined, regardless of whether they were symptomatic, Vo has seen its new infections crumble. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This tiny town has taught us a lot,\" Crisanti told state-run RAI radio. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Crisanti said the Vo study showed that even asymptomatic people transmit the virus, since the few new infections registered between tests were within households of asymptomatic people. The only way to stop the spread, he told RAI, is more testing, active surveillance of all positive cases and quarantine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Based on the Vo results, Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia is planning to vastly ramp up testing across the region, aiming to reach 20,000 tests a day and hand out protective masks to each family. Already, Veneto has tested more than 83,000 people, and compared to hard-hit Lombardy next door, has a comparatively low mortality rate with 313 dead and 7,497 positive cases. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The government on March 10 imposed a nationwide lockdown after an initial quarantine of a dozen small towns in Lombardy and Veneto failed to stop the spread of the virus. On Thursday, Italy idled all non-essential production and industry, the most widespread manufacturing shutdown in the world. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The industrial lobby Confindustria has estimated it could cost 70 billion-to-100 billion euros ($77 billion-$110 billion) of national wealth a month if 70% of companies are closed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Two weeks in, the measures appear to be having their effect on the virus, slowing new infections and relieving pressure on the health system. By Friday, nearly 11,000 of Italy’s 86,500 infected had been cured.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president of Italy's National Institutes of Health, Dr. Silvio Brusaferro, said Friday that Italy hadn't yet reached the peak of its infection curve or begun to see a decline. But he said: “What we have are signs of a slowing that makes us think that we are close.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Twenty days after coming down with a fever, and after nearly a week in an air-pressurized helmet pumping oxygen into his virus-ravaged lungs, Fausto Russo is now breathing on his own and hopes to go home as early as Sunday from the Santa Maria Goretti hospital in Latina, near Rome. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s a horrible sensation, not being able to breathe,” said Russo, a 38-year-old fitness trainer. “Imagine putting your head under water.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lorini, the doctor, knows well the toll that the virus takes on both patients and hospital staff. When he goes home each night, a five-minute walk from the hospital, he allows himself a few minutes to listen to music and “unplug” from the intensity of the ICU ward. \u003c/p>\u003cp>His current favorite song is Bruce Springsteen’s “Secret Garden.” He smiles as he thinks about the lyrics. “You've gone a million miles/ How far'd you get/ To that place where/ You can't remember/ And you can't forget.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Listen to it today,” Lorini suggested. “It will give you a sense of tenderness.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This version corrects spelling of Springsteen's name.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Barry reported from Soave, Italy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Testing in Los Angeles County is expected to increase from 500 per day to 5,000 by the end of the week.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I would love to be able to say with all certainty that's where we're not going,” Los Angeles Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said when asked about New York's numbers. “We would be foolish not to prepare for a similar scenario here in LA County.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In both cities, schools have been canceled, many businesses shuttered and employees who can have been ordered to work from home. New York City, with roughly 8.5 million residents, had nearly 45,000 cases and at least 366 deaths as of Friday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Los Angeles County, which contains its namesake city of 4 million people plus an additional 6 million residents, had nearly 1,500 cases and 26 deaths.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health experts don't know why there is such a big difference in the number of cases, but believe several things could be at play, such as urban density, differences in the use of mass transportation and slightly earlier moves by authorities to enact social distancing policies. A difference in the speed and amount of tests could also be factors, as officials warn that many people who get COVID-19 don't necessarily have symptoms. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The virus is spread in tiny droplets from coughs and sneezes. Most people who get it experience mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For others, in particular older adults or people with other large health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While a shortage of tests in California during the early weeks of the crisis is one reason for a much lower number of cases, it doesn't alone explain the difference. New York has tested about three times as many patients, but it has 10 times as many cases as all of California. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced New York's first case March 1. The first person reported in Los Angeles, California's second case, was announced Jan. 26. \u003c/p>\u003cp>To date, there have been 519 deaths in New York state, more than six times the 85 in California. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The death rate from COVID-19 in California is doubling every three days, which is lower than the New York death rate of doubling every two days,” said Dr. Jennifer Prah Ruger, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania medical school. “It is hard to know with certainty the exact causal mechanisms at this stage in the epidemic.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Factors that could explain the differences in the outbreak between New York City and LA speak to the differences in the way people live on opposite coasts.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"d0ead650-6ae0-11ea-ada0-cf25117f1e1c\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In New York, residents live in large multi-unit buildings, many with small elevators and tight hallways. City sidewalks are choked with walkers and commuters who flow in and out of the city's robust subway system. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“New York City is a more densely packed community than what we see in California, even in Los Angeles, which is much more spread out,\" said Robert Kim-Farley, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. \"The mixing, if you will, of population is much greater there.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, Kim-Farley warned that with a simultaneous rise in cases and testing, “we’re going to start seeing just tremendous increases,” in the next two weeks in LA. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Indeed, on Thursday confirmed cases in LA jumped 50%, which health officials attributed to the availability of kits. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This represents a huge jump, my friends: an increase of more than 50% in a single day of confirmed cases,\" said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. \"Even more disturbingly, we see that if this rate of increase continues (in the county), in six days we will be where New York is today, the same number of cases per capita as they are struggling through.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>New York's public transportation system carries 8 million passengers a day, about eight times the ridership on Los Angeles public transit. Commuters in Los Angeles are far more likely to travel alone by car on one of the many freeways that crisscross a county 10 times the size of New York City.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Professor James Moore II, director of the transportation engineering department at the University of Southern California, said he stopped riding the light rail to campus as the outbreak started spreading. He bought a parking permit and began to drive, a social distancing luxury not everyone can afford, particularly in New York City where car ownership is scarcer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It stands to reason ... if you pack small areas and you’re dealing with a disease that is more contagious than the flu but less contagious than the measles, somewhere in there you’re probably going to come away with a lot of cases,\" Moore said. “The fact that we rely fairly heavily on automobiles in Southern California and California in general is sort of a lucky break in the crisis for us.\" \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:8694331514\">Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak\u003c/div>\u003cp>Another element that could have slowed the spread in California was earlier action to force social distancing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On March 19, Garcetti, LA's mayor, shut down schools, restaurants and ordered all but essential employees to work from home and Gov. Gavin Newsom issued the nation's first statewide stay-at-home directive that evening. New York Gov.

One parent, for example, has refused to turn over a child to the other in accordance with their agreement, citing the virus crisis, even though the other parent is taking every precaution. Police have refused to enforce the custody order and recommended the parent go to court, but it's unclear if judges will deem the case an emergency. In another case Kouzi is aware of involving a separated couple, one parent is allowing their kids to go see friends, “to be the fun parent, so the kids will want to stay there full-time instead of with the parent actually following recommendations and guidelines.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's not all grim. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Some parents have actually risen to the occasion and are communicating better than normal, rearranging schedules and increasing FaceTime access and doing what makes sense” for their kids, she says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kouzi, who practices in both New York and in Westchester County, one of its suburbs, is telling her clients to try to use the time productively or to consider mediation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“There will be such a backlog when courts open up again,” she says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some couples are experiencing only minor ripples, if any. Stephanie Pfeiffer, a business systems analyst in Boston, found herself annoyed with her husband when they went food shopping last week, and each time she put something into the cart — two pounds of butter, cans of tuna or tomato soup, a box of crackers — he questioned why.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We're arguing over groceries,” said Pfeiffer. “He accuses me of panicking and hoarding, but the reality is we NEED more groceries.” After all, the couple is now working at home together.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a minor adjustment, Pfeiffer recently moved her makeshift work station away from the kitchen table, where her husband works, into a corner of the dining room. “Now we cannot see each other,” she quips. “As time stretches out, I'm optimistic we will get into a routine and settle in.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some stay-at-home mothers say their husbands, now homebound, are finally seeing how much domestic work their spouses do. In New Jersey, Caren Tolleth, mother of a 5-year-old and a 9-month-old, finds that her workload has only increased with the addition of her husband to the routine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It's been like most days,” she reported last week, “except that my husband is leaving dirty dishes and I get to clean up after him, too.” She joked that her spouse had made the mistake of coming down at one point to chat, “and I handed him a baby to put down for a nap.
