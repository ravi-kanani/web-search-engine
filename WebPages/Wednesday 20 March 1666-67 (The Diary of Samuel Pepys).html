        <h1> Wednesday 20 March 1666/67 </h1> 
        <p>Up pretty betimes, and to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4002/">Old Swan</a>, and there drank at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">Michell’s</a>, but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">his wife</a> is not there, but gone to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6513/">her mother’s</a>, who is ill, and so hath staid there since Sunday. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a> and drank at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1707/">the Swan</a>, and ‘baiserais the petite misse’; and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin’s</a> … I sent for some burnt <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a>, and drank and then away, not pleased with my folly, and so to the Hall again, and there staid a little, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> by water again, where, after speaking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">[Sir] J. Minnes</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">our church</a> to the vestry, to be assessed by the late <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10745/">Poll Bill</a>, where I am rated as an Esquire, and for my office, all will come to about 50<i>l.</i>. But not more than I expected, nor so much by a great deal as I ought to be, for all my offices. So shall be glad to escape so. Thence by water again to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there up into the house, and do hear that newes is come now that the enemy do incline again to a peace, but could hear no particulars, so do not believe it. I had a great mind to have spoke with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, about a business proper enough for me, about the French prize <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10489/">man-of-war</a>, how he would have her altered, only out of a desire to show myself mindful of business, but my linen was so dirty and my clothes mean, that I neither thought it fit to do that, nor go to other persons at the Court, with whom I had business, which did vex me, and I must remedy [it]. Here I hear that the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6590/">Duke of Richmond</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/">Mrs. Stewart</a> were betrothed last night. Thence to Westminster Hall again, and there saw Betty Michell, and bought a pair of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13924/">gloves</a> of her, she being fain to keep shop there, her mother being sick, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6514/">her father</a> gathering of the tax. I ‘aimais her de toute my corazon’. Thence, my mind wandering all this day upon ‘mauvaises amours’ which I be merry for. So home by water again, where I find my wife gone abroad, so I to Sir W. Batten to dinner, and had a good dinner of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3162/">ling</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1332/">herring</a> pie, very good meat, best of the kind that ever I had. Having dined, I by coach to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">Temple</a>, and there did buy a little book or two, and it is strange how “<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10441/">Rycaut’s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10442/">Discourse of Turky</a>,” which before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">the fire</a> I was asked but 8<i>s.</i> for, there being all but twenty-two or thereabouts burned, I did now offer 20<i>s.</i>, and he demands 50<i>s.</i>, and I think I shall give it him, though it be only as a monument of the fire. So to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a>, where I find my wife, and so took her to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke’s</a>, and left her there, and I to White Hall, and thence to Westminster, only out of idleness, and to get some little pleasure to my ‘mauvais flammes’, but sped not, so back and took up my wife; and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10289/">Polichinelli</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/138/">Charing Crosse</a>, which is prettier and prettier, and so full of variety that it is extraordinary good entertainment. Thence by coach home, that is, my wife home, and I to the Exchange, and there met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1637/">Fenn</a>, who tells me they have yet no orders out of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/290/">Exchequer</a> for money upon the Acts, which is a thing not to be borne by any Prince of understanding or care, for no money can be got advanced upon the Acts only from the weight of orders in form out of the Exchequer so long time after the passing of the Acts. So home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> a little, where I met with a sad letter from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a>, who tells me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a> is declared by the doctors to be past recovery, and that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> is also very ill every hour: so that I fear we shall see a sudden change there. God fit them and us for it! So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen’s</a>, where my wife was, and supped with a little, but yet little mirth, and a bad, nasty supper, which makes me not love the family, they do all things so meanly, to make a little bad show upon their backs. Thence home and to bed, very much troubled about my father’s and my mother’s illness.</p>
