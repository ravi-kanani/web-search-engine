             <li> <p>We provide control tools to help you manage your experience with us. If you have an existing Yahoo or AOL account, you will need to agree to this Privacy Policy. If you have not yet agreed to this Privacy Policy, the <a href="https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm?redirect=no">legacy Yahoo Privacy Policy</a> or <a href="http://privacy.aol.com/legacy">legacy Oath Privacy Policy (for AOL)</a> still apply to your account.
