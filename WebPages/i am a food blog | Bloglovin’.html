Nothing beat\u2019s mom\u2019s soup!

It makes for the loveliest presentation and feels so special and decadent. And when served up with a big piece of crusty bread, my husband and I agree that there\u2019s nothing better.

Oh my goodness. The fluffiest banana cake with coffee icing? HELLO LOVER.  I just might be the most popular person in my house right now because Max and Emilia have been begging for banana bread\u2026 so I surprised them with banana cake.  They also secretly like to steal a sip of my iced coffee so they are all over the coffee frosting. Shhhhh. We are all in looooove. Except for Eddie. Who would rather me not ruin frosting with coffee.  But that just means more for us.  Come see me make this on instagram today! This quarantine situation actually gave me the perfect excuse to make this cake. I mean, it\u2019s giving me the perfect situation to do a lot of things that I\u2019m not doing: like spring cleaning, organizing closets, going through all of my photography props, deep cleaning ever corner of the house\u2026 but no. Instead I just keep making things like brownies and cookie bars and cake. Ever since making my banana bread with espresso glaze, I have been IN LOVE with the combination. It\u2019s so delicious and the banana and espresso complement each other so well.  I don\u2019t know why I waited so long but it\u2019s here! And you will LOVE it.  It\u2019s so good and kind of reminds me of my pumpkin dream cake. Just swap the pumpkin for banana, because the fluffy cream cheese frosting stays the same with one little extra addition. Which is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Oh my gosh yes yes yes \u2013 it\u2019s so good.  You probably have most of the ingredients in your pantry to make the cake. You only need two large-ish bananas too. (P.S. if you find yourself with extra bananas going bad, freeze them for recipes like these in the future!) I like a combo of brown and white sugars in the cake, but you can use one or the other if that\u2019s all you have. Sour cream can replace the yogurt. And of course you can add more spices to the cake or even some chocolate chips!   Okay now for the tricky part: the espresso powder. This is an ingredient that I do keep in my pantry for recipes like these. And that\u2019s the secret for the coffee cream cheese frosting. If you don\u2019t have it, you can use instant coffee powder. If you don\u2019t have that, you can try adding 1 tablespoon of strongly brewed coffee, but it may not add quite as much flavor. And if you don\u2019t have any of those, guess what?  JUST LEAVE IT OUT!  Yes \u2013 the frosting will be totally fine and still fantastic because cream cheese is what dreams are made of. So wonderful and creamy and rich and decadent. Plus, cream cheese frosting is amazing with banana bread so you\u2019re really not missing much. You can always order a jar of espresso frosting and make the coffee flavored icing at another time!  This square makes me so ridiculously happy.  I just love a sheet cake like this because it lasts. It\u2019s not like banana bread which somehow disappears in 34 seconds in our house. This one is a bit more rich and decadent. It serves a crowd, otherwise known as your family that you\u2019re with in your house for the foreseeable future. It travels well, you can bake it ahead of time and it tastes freaking fantastic. Plus, it\u2019s sort of cute!  Banana Cake with Coffee Cream Cheese Frosting     Print  Banana Cake with Coffee Cream Cheese Frosting   This banana cake is a delicious twist on banana bread!

Hello heaven!!  Today I have an extra little bonus recipe here for you so you have a project in the kitchen this weekend. It\u2019s a fun one too. And a delicious one! Plus, it will go amazingly well with this chickpea curry.  I shared a naan bread a million years ago but this garlic butter version is TOPS. It is the ultimate comfort food. And guess what? You don\u2019t need any yeast! In the craziest turn of events, I can\u2019t find ANY yeast in my grocery stores right now. I mean, are people really baking that much bread? If so, that\u2019s wonderful. But the bread aisles are practically empty too! Maybe they are just making a lot of pizza.  Yes.  Let\u2019s think that.   So anyway \u2013 this naan bread doesn\u2019t use yeast \u2013 it uses baking powder and soda. I\u2019ve made versions with both yeast and baking powder and I really love both. You\u2019re still going to let this one rise for a while, so don\u2019t get TOO excited. It only helps with the flavor.  You\u2019re also going to use yogurt! I\u2019ve used both plain regular yogurt and plain greek yogurt with success. If you don\u2019t have plain yogurt right now, you can use all milk. But if you have the yogurt, go for it.  The dough rises, you form it into balls, roll it out and cook it on a cast iron skillet. It gets all charred and delicious! But then comes the best part \u2013 the garlic butter.  OH YES. Melt some butter in a saucepan and stir in minced garlic cloves. Brush it directly on the hot naan bread. Sprinkle on some fresh parsley and you are in business! While I have always loved naan, Eddie is absolutely fanatical over it. Probably loves it more than I do! If I don\u2019t make it, he buys a package every week (which isn\u2019t anywhere near as good as homemade). We often use it for these smoky chicken pitas (instead of the pita!) and we make quick pizzas on naan too.  It\u2019s just SO easy. Make it your project!  Garlic Butter Naan Bread     Print  Garlic Butter Naan   This garlic butter naan bread recipe is divine! It uses baking powder and baking soda instead of yeast and is drenched with garlic butter. So delicious!  Course breadCuisine American  Prep Time 15 minutesCook Time 15 minutesResting Time 1 hour 30 minutesTotal Time 2 hours  Servings 8 pieces Author How Sweet Eats  Ingredients  2 cups all-purpose flour \u00be teaspoon baking powder \u00bd teaspoon baking soda 1\/2 teaspoon salt \u00bd cups warm milk \u00bd cups plain yogurt 1 teaspoon honey canola or vegetable oil, for brushing 4 tablespoons salted butter 3 garlic cloves, minced fresh chopped parsley, for sprinkling   Instructions  In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, soda and salt. In another bowl, whisk together the milk, yogurt and honey. Add half of the milk mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until the dough starts to come together. Add the remaining milk gradually, stirring and bringing the dough together with your hands. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover it. Let it sit in a warm place for 1.5 to 2 hours. It won\u0027t rise much! But let it rest. Once it rests, remove it from the bowl and knead it a few times on a floured surface, using some extra flour if it\u2019s too sticky. Divide the dough into 8 separate balls. Roll each ball out into an oval shape. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Once it\u2019s hot, brush it with a bit of canola (or another high heat) oil. Place the dough on the skillet and let it cook for 2 minutes or until it begins to bubble. Flip it and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dough. Heat the butter in a saucepan over medium heat until it melts. Stir in the garlic and turn off the heat. Brush the naan with the garlic butter and sprinkle with fresh parsley.    I wish I could make this pan magically appear in your kitchen! The post Garlic Butter Naan.

Especially since I\u2019m not feeling makeup at the moment. While a few things have stayed the same, I have some new favorites too. I\u2019m really not wearing much makeup at all right now given this quarantined state\u2026 and honestly don\u2019t have much desire to even play with it. But when it comes to skincare, I haven\u2019t missed a beat. My morning and nighttime skin care are a part of my daily routine. And I find that when I\u2019m anxious and let things slip, everything goes down hill \u2013 healthy habits, skin care, etc. So I\u2019ve made sure to keep up with it this month. Obviously this is a frivolous post in this crazy time, but if you need a moment to take your mind off everything, it\u2019s here! Plus, it\u2019s like a sneaky peek into my bathroom closet. P.S. I get most of my skincare at Sephora, Nordstrom or Dermstore. I never buy skincare at full price unless I am desperate and run out, but I have it timed pretty well so that I can take advantage of the sales. Sephora usually has a sale in April and November and that\u2019s when I stock up on Drunk Elephant products. Dermstore has occasional sales too, but SkinCueticals is rarely on sale. If you sign up for emails from Dermstore (ugh, annoying I know), usually once or twice a year there will be a discount on SkinCueticals. Sometimes I find a few things on sale with a 20% Ulta coupon too! Okay, onto the details\u2026  Morning Skin Caudalie Moisturizing Toner. I don\u2019t wash my face in the morning! I mean, unless I am sick or overly sweaty or something, I do not wash my face. My skin is dry, so it works better for me. The only thing I do is use this toner with an exfoliating cotton round. Indie Lee Brightening Cleanser. I do have one exception \u2013 on mornings when I work out, I use this cleanser. I love it. Smells like heaven! SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic Serum. This has been the biggest change to my routine in the last year. I finally bought this and I am obsessed with it. Already on my second bottle. It has made my skin brighter, more even and generally more glowy. Definitely worth the hype. Biossance Squalane and Peptide Eye Gel. This is the eye cream I\u2019ve been using the last few weeks and I LOVE it. Mostly because I really like how it works under concealer. It\u2019s great. Drunk Elephant Protini Polypetide Moisturizer. This is still my go-to daily moisturizer. It\u2019s gel-like and not too heavy, but still enough for my skin. EltaMD Broad Spectrum SPF 46. If I\u2019m leaving the house (ha, so not at the moment!), I love this sunscreen. I like how makeup goes over it too, but honestly I\u2019m really just wearing tinted moisturizer\/BB cream over it. SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion Defense SPF 50. Sometimes I use this SPF instead \u2013 it\u2019s a very light liquidy formula but it\u2019s tinted. I use this more often if we\u2019re going to be outside a lot and I don\u2019t want to wear any makeup, but I do want a little bit of coverage. This goes on so nicely. I don\u2019t ever wear this under makeup. Nighttime Skin MAC Cleanse Off Oil. This is still my absolute FAVORITE makeup remover! I love the pump, it completely dissolves any makeup perfectly \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful. If I don\u2019t have makeup on that day, I tend to use this Elemis Cleansing Balm. After that, I use the Caudalie Toner + exfoliating cotton round again. Sunday Riley Good Genes. This is still my forever holy grail, favorite product of life. I cannot live without it. It takes all texture from my skin \u2013 it removes blemishes usually in one night. I LOVE IT. I alternate this product and use it every other day. I use Luna Oil with it once or twice a week too. Dr Dennis Gross Daily Peel Pads. I still alternate the above with these peel pads. So every other day, I use these after cleansing. Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Cream. This has been my go-to night cream for years now. I love it. I also just tend to use this as eye cream too. It\u2019s perfect. If needed, I add one of the extras below! Extras SkinCueticals Hydrating B5 Gel. I\u2019ve had this for a few months and really love it if my skin is super dry. I use it at night after the Good Genes or Peel Pads, before the moisturizer. Indie Lee Squalane Facial Oil. Definitely my new favorite facial oil. This is light (if that\u2019s possible for an oil) and sinks in nicely. I will either add a drop to my moisturizer or use a layer of this over the moisturizer. Drunk Elephant F Balm Overnight Mask. This mask has replaced my longtime Dr Jart favorite that I can no longer find. It\u2019s great if your skin is super parched. I used this overtop of everything as the last step. Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask. This is a bonus hydrating mask I\u2019ll do either on a weekend or a night when I take my makeup off early \u2013 and just want some extra moisture for my skin. It says you can wipe this off in 10 minutes but I often keep it on! It is very hydrating and makes your face so smooth. Body Weleda Skin Food. This is my go-to hand cream (especially now!) and the cream I use if I have any really dry patches. I\u2019ve even used this on my face if needed. It\u2019s definitely super thick, but WORKS. I use this mostly at night or when I have a few minutes to let it sink it during the day. Indie Lee Energizing Body Wash. I love this body wash right now. It smells like heaven. Sol de Janiero Brazilian Nude Body Cream. Favorite body cream, hands down! It has a pump, it\u2019s fragrance free and it\u2019s very moisturizing. Indie Lee De Stress Body Oil. My skin is especially dry in winter and I often add a drop of oil into my moisturizer, but a few months ago I found this and am obsessed. It\u2019s a spray oil and sprays WONDERFULLY (this is important if you\u2019ve ever tried a spray oil!) right onto your skin. I like the de stress version because, well, quarantine. Exfolikate. I end up using Exfolikate once a week because it\u2019s Eddie\u2019s favorite exfoliator and it stays in our shower. I use it on my arms and occasionally, maybe once a month, even on my face. KP Duty Body Scrub. This is my all-time favorite scrub though! If you\u2019ve ever had the KP bumps on the back of your arms or legs, this is MAGIC. You do need to use it consistently, but it works so well. KP Duty AHA Moisturizing Therapy. This is a cream version of the scrub above and it is a miracle worker. Great to use on your arms before\/during summer. First Aid Beauty KP Bump Eraser. This is similar to the KP duty scrub above, but it\u2019s in a tube! I use this one if I\u2019m in a rush in the shower because you just squeeze it out (as opposed to a tub). Supergoop Play Everyday SPF 50 Sunscreen. I\u2019ve used this sunscreen for a couple years now (they have changed the name twice!) and I really like it for everyday. And this one has a pump! That changes everything.  And that\u2019s that! Pretty much everything that goes on my skin. I\u2019m so curious to know yours! Share, share below!

It\u2019s warming, comforting, so ridiculously easy, super flavorful and comes together very fast. Like 20 minutes fast. Seriously! Because we all need a meal like that right now.  Years ago (like seven years ago! yikes! how?), I first shared this chickpea curry recipe and it has remained a favorite staple ever since. You guys love it. I love it. It\u2019s super easy. It\u2019s so flavorful.  You can make it in a few minutes! I love that. And now it sounds just like the recipe here too.  I\u2019ve put many twists on that recipe over the years in my own kitchen, adding whatever I have on hand in the kitchen. Seasonal produce, chicken or shrimp, different herbs, even other beans.   One combo that I just can never get enough of is basil + coconut curry. I usually love it with chicken, so I knew it would be fantastic with chickpeas! The best part about it is that it\u2019s the ultimate pantry meal. Oh yeah. We have: Dried basil. Curry powder. Beans. Coconut milk. Rice, if you want it.  And then of course a few other delicious things, like garlic and ginger and lime.  I mean, it is super easy and ridiculously flavorful. And! It comes together SO fast. The curry alone will be done in 15 or 20 minutes.   First, you saut\u00e9 an onion and bell pepper with some garlic and ginger. Then, stir in the basil and curry powder. Next, the chickpeas and coconut milk. Finally, spritz in some lime and you\u2019re in flavor town. You\u2019ve arrived.  I can\u2019t even take it!   I love to add lots of fresh basil too.  If you don\u2019t have it on hand right now, don\u2019t sweat! In this quarantined state we gotta make do with what\u2019s in our kitchen. If you\u2019re able to grab some or grow some, go for it. If you really love basil but you\u2019re not able to get it right now, you can add more dried basil to the mix. And if you want more greens, you can toss in spinach or kale. Or even asparagus or green beans.  Oh yeah \u2013 and if you want to make this once we\u2019re out of quarantine, it\u2019s a fresh, springy almost-summery twist on a classic comforting dish. Definitely works in this season, regardless of what\u2019s going on outside.  Of course, while the curry comes together in 20 minutes, you may need to add a few extra minutes for whatever you serve it with.  Like rice. Or even potatoes. Or this amazing garlic butter naan (I\u2019ll share the recipe tomorrow, in the meantime, here\u2019s my recipe from 2011) that you can dip in the sauce over and over again. Whatever it is, prep it at the beginning so it can cook while you make the curry.  Make it your own. Add one can of chickpeas for a more soup-like curry. Use two cans for a heartier curry. Add chicken or shrimp, more vegetables that are about to go in the crisper drawer, frozen vegetables like peas or green beans or corn. Serve it over another grain or even rice noodles. Whatever you like!  Just going to live on this for the next few weeks.  20 Minute Basil Chickpea Curry     Print  Basil Chickpea Curry   This basil chickpea coconut curry comes together in 20 minutes!

This is a tough time, but we\u2019re here for you\u2014whether it\u2019s a new pantry recipe or a useful tip for your kitchen, here are some ideas to make things run a little more smoothly for you and your loved ones.  Like most people, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of cleaning and disinfecting lately (yes, there\u2019s a difference between the two).
