Here's why.","title_tag":null,"author":"Monica Chin","post_date":"2019-08-20T15:31:12+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 15:31:12 +0000","formatted_date":"08/20/2019","sort_key":"1I066k","link":"https://mashable.com/article/why-you-need-vpn/","content":{"plain":"Even if you don't think you're being tracked online, you are. \nYour internet service provider (ISP) can see everything you do. While there probably isn't a guy at Time Warner Cable sitting in a corner office watching your every move, many ISPs do compile anonymous browsing logs and sometimes sell them to advertising companies. With that data, advertisers can tailor their content directly to certain regions or browsing habits.\nSEE ALSO: Net Neutrality is dead and your privacy is at risk. Here are 5 VPNs that can help.\nThis is one of the big reasons more and more people online are considering a virtual private network, or VPN, which can keep your online behavior private. As many as one quarter of internet users around the world use VPNs, according to a survey from Global Web Index.\nRight now there's definite cause for concern. Last March, the Senate voted to permit internet providers to sell customers' browsing history without their knowledge or approval. Then in November, the FCC scrapped Obama-era net neutrality regulations, giving ISPs even broader control over the data traveling over their networks. \nEven putting aside the changing legal landscape, data is always vulnerable to hackers, and almost certainly accessible to a government or law enforcement agency. If provided with a subpoena or a warrant from the police, your ISP is required to give up your browsing history. \nWhile we don't endorse doing anything against the law while you're online, there are many valid reasons (several are outlined below) why you should make it harder for interested parties to get access to your online activity, and a VPN is one of the most reliable.\nYour VPN serves as an anonymous middleman that does your browsing for you.\nSome VPN basics: A VPN is a secure connection between your computer and a server. Normally, when you connect to the internet, you first connect to your ISP (Verizon, Spectrum, Comcast, or someone else), which then connects you to whatever websites you visit. When you use a VPN, you connect to a server run by your VPN provider, which directs your traffic instead.\nEssentially, your VPN serves as an anonymous middleman that does your browsing for you, so providers can't track the sites you're visiting. This means your ISP can't see what you're doing on the internet. It also means you appear to access the internet from the IP address of your VPN server (rather than your own IP address), so any website monitoring your activity won't know where you're browsing from. \nThere are all kinds of reasons you might want to use a VPN:\n1. When you're on public Wi-Fi\nWhen you're using a public Wi-Fi network, even one that's password-protected, a VPN is your best friend. If a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network, it's actually quite easy for them to snoop on your data. The basic security that your average coffee shop uses, a WPA2 password, doesn't actually protect you from others on the network in a robust way.\nUsing a VPN will add an extra layer of security to your data, ensuring you bypass the coffee shop's ISP and encrypting all your communication. Hackers will need to find easier prey.\n2. When you're traveling\nIf you're traveling to a foreign country (say, China, where sites like Facebook are blocked), a VPN can help you access services that may not be available in that country. \nOften, the VPN will allow you to use streaming services that you paid for and have access to in your home country, but for international rights issues aren't available in another. Using a VPN can make it seem like you're enjoying the service just like you were at home. VPN use sees huge spikes from non-U.S. countries during events like the Super Bowl and March Madness. Netflix is always trying to crack down on VPN users, but many VPN providers are continuously adapting their services in response. It's a bit of a whack-a-mole game, but some VPNs do, in fact, poke through. \nTravelers may also be able to find cheaper airfare when using a VPN, as prices can vary from region to region.\nSEE ALSO: The best VPNs for Mac users looking for privacy\n3. When you're a remote worker or student\nMany employers require the use of a VPN to access company services remotely, for security reasons. A VPN that connects to your office's server can give you access to internal company networks and resources when you're not in the office. It can do the same for your home network while you're out and about. \n4. When you're a political dissident\nSome countries don't have the same protections for press freedom, speech, and expression that many Western countries have, and a few regimes even take draconian measures to monitor and take action against those they see as threats to the regime. \nIt should almost go without saying that for political dissidents, using a VPN (among other privacy tools) is essential for internet use within an oppressive regime. They're not a catch-all solution, though, and governments are beginning to crack down on their use. \n5. When you just want some privacy\nEven in the comfort of your own home, doing your regular internet thing, using a VPN isn't a terrible idea. Generally, it will keep you from leaving footprints on the web for your ISP to scoop up.\nHowever, when choosing a VPN for day-to-day browsing, it pays to do your research.\nSEE ALSO: These are the best VPNs for your Android device\nA word of caution about VPNs\nWith a VPN, it's true your ISP may no longer have access to your browsing data, but the VPN provider now does. Some VPNs even sell that data to third parties, just like your ISP may or may not do, so in that way you could be right back where you started. That's why you should be especially cautious of \"free\" VPNs. Those services still have to make money, and chances are your data is the primary revenue source. That said, the VPN's terms may be more favorable to your privacy than, say, Comcast's. However, if you want to play things safer, you're better off paying for a VPN. \nSome paid VPNs still log user data, which just means any subpoena would pass from your ISP to the VPN provider. That said, it's likely be harder for law enforcement to get that data if your VPN isn't local to your country. \nIn summary: If you're concerned about privacy for any reason, using a VPN is a great option -- just make sure you read the fine print of the VPN provider you go with. And don't always take their word for it -- some VPN providers claim they don't keep logs on user data, but third parties have discovered evidence that they actually do. \nThere are many other precautions you can take to protect your privacy online besides using a VPN. One is the privacy-centric browser Tor, which hides your traffic by rerouting it through a series of nodes, each of which can only see parts of your IP address, making it extremely difficult to track users. Tor is free to use. The Tor Project, the non-profit that builds the browser, is funded mostly through grants and donations.\n\n \n\nThe Best VPNs\nReady to find a VPN that best suits your needs? Here are Mashable's picks:\n1. Private Internet Access VPN\n\"It installs in a jiffy and comes with a ton of features for all types of users, no matter if you're a beginner just starting out with a VPN or an advanced user who likes noodling around with settings.\"\n2.

TorGuard\n\"If you're a heavy BitTorrent user, TorGuard is the VPN you're looking for.\"\n6.

This is definitely true: According to Verizon's 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report, 81% of hacking related breaches involved the misuse of stolen or weak credentials — AKA crappy passwords. And we probably don't have to tell you this, but having your money or identity stolen isn't exactly a good time.\nSEE ALSO: Protect yourself from identity theft with these blackout roller stamps\nRemembering your complex, unique passwords for dozens of different sites is nearly impossible, especially when password requirements sound more like the recipe for a potion. Uppercase letter, number, symbol, eye of newt, etc.\nAnd that's where password managers come in. \nBecause without one, logging in usually goes something like this:\n1. You enter 10 different passwords and they're all wrong\n2. You try to change your password to a new one that you know\n3. \"New password cannot be the same as old password.\"\nvia GIPHY\n\nBut with a password manager, all you have to do is remember one master password — and they'll autofill the rest for you, plus more security stuff you probably didn't even think of. It's like keeping a list of passwords in your phone's notes, except losing your phone won't mean that your entire life is about to be hacked.\nThings to consider when choosing a password manager:\n\n  Do you want passwords to be remembered on your phone and laptop? If so, you'll need to make sure the password manager allows syncing on multiple devices. (As you'll see, most free versions other than LastPass do not allow more than one device.) \n  Are you storing passwords just for personal use or do you need to share with a group?\n  Two-factor authentication: Using the Google Authenticator app, an external device, or something similar, does the password manager require a second form of insurance to make sure that it's actually you trying to log in? Without this, if someone gets ahold of your master password, they have access to all of your stuff.\n  Emergency contacts: If you forget your master password, you need to make sure you're not completely screwed. Many password managers are equipped with emergency contacts, which are basically the password version of writing someone into your will. Here is where you give a trusted friend, family member, or boss access to your master password in the event that you can't provide it.\n\nWe've sifted through six of the best password managers out there to give you a rundown on what each plan offers, so you can find the one that fits your needs.\nTop of the line, but one the pricier side\nDashlane — $39.99/year\n\nOne of the most well-rounded options of the bunch is Dashlane, one of PC Mag's Editor's Choice picks. With one of the slickest looking and most user-friendly interfaces (including 11 language options), Dashlane Premium makes managing passwords on multiple devices a piece of cake. \nOnce you install the Dashlane app, it can be accessed by a dropdown menu in your browser toolbar or a standalone browser extension (available on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari for iOS devices — yes, even the Apple Watch). Dashlane gives you the option to import passwords from any site, and also allows you to import passwords from other password managers. After importing passwords from all of your sites, you can separate them into categories (like banks and shopping, social media, etc.), and Dashlane will let you know if it thinks any are too weak. If they are, Dashlane can generate a super random, strong password for you. For extra security, turn on two-factor authentication using Google Authenticator.\nPremium also offers unlimited password sharing — just enter their email address and specify what they're allowed to do with the password (which seems simple, but a lot of password managers make the whole sharing thing pretty difficult). You can also set up Emergency Contacts here.\nAs one of the most all-encompassing options, it's also one of the priciest coming in at $39.99/year. However, for this many features and the extreme simplicity, we'd say it's worth it. Sign up for Dashlane Premium here.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Dashlane Premium — $39.99/year\n              See Details\n            \n          \nSticky Password — $29.99/year\n\nAnother Editor's Choice from PC Mag is Sticky Password Premium. For those who are borderline obsessed with cybersecurity, this may be your best bet. It stores an encrypted copy of your data in the cloud, and the only way you can get to it is with your online password and master password. And, for extra extra security, you can also opt for secure no-cloud sync. Here, your devices will sync any time they're in the same Wi-Fi network, and your data never leaves your devices. As for two factor authentication? Unlock a Sticky Password using your master password, plus a time-sensitive password via your smartphone that updates every 30 seconds.\nSticky Password Premium is $10 cheaper than Dashlane, can be installed on MacOS, iOS, Windows, and Android devices, and automatically syncs all devices together when the master password is entered. Sticky Password Premium can import and manage bookmarks and passwords across common internet browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc., and also supports more obscure browsers like SeaMonkey. Sticky Password will offer to generate strong passwords and also supports app passwords.\nFun fact: For each subscription, Sticky Pass Premium donates a portion of the money to a manatee protection fund. If you didn't think it was a great choice before, we bet you do now.\nSign up for Sticky Password Premium for $29.99/year here.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Sticky Password Premium — $29.99/year\n              See Details\n            \n          \nKeeper Security & Digital Vault — $29.99/year and $59.99/year\n\nAnother Editor's Choice from PC Mag is Keeper Security & Digital Vault. Recently upgraded, this password manager sports a polished look with the color scheme of your choice, and is an excellent, all-encompassing choice. Keeper is not messing around.\nWhen we say all-encompassing, we mean it: Keeper has a broad selection of native apps for macOS, iOS, Windows, Windows Phone, Android, Kindle, and Linux, as well as browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer — so there's never a device left out. One unique feature is Keeper's Zero Knowledge philosophy: meaning the user and the user only knows the master password, no info is remembered in the cloud, and it can only be decrypted with that password or by answering a security question. Other password managers have an automatic password update feature, which allows the company to know your master password. However, when it is time to update, Keeper can generate a new password for you.\nKeeper is not only a place to store passwords, but also a place to store your private documents, photos, and other files — it's like the hardcore version of putting a passcode on your phone so no one can see all of the weird pictures you've saved. The amount of file storage available depends on what subscription you choose, and Keeper offers three: an individual plan and a business plan, both $29.99/year, as well as a five-license family plan for $59.99/year. The family plan includes 10GB of storage, making it a pretty sweet deal. If your family shares a lot of logins for things like Netflix or Wi-Fi, Keeper's Family Plan is 100% your best bet.\nSign up for Keeper Security Unlimited for $29.99/year or Keeper Security Family for $59.99/year here.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Keeper Security & Digital Vault — $29.99/year\n              See Details\n            \n          \nPassword Boss Premium v2.0 — $29.99/year\n\nAnother strong contender is Password Boss Premium v2.0. Possibly the nicest interface to look at (other than Dashlane), Password Boss does basically everything you'd want a good password manager to do — it even supports MacOS and iOS devices in its new version, which it previously lacked. Now, Password Boss Premium can sync across all devices, storing your data in the cloud using government level encryption (according to the website).\nWhen you go on a secure site that you haven't been on yet, Password Boss will offer to save the login info, and then will automatically log you in every time you go on that site. Once a password is saved, you can create folders and separate your credentials into categories by dragging and dropping. Aside from passwords, Password Boss will also store important info like bank account and credit card information, IDs, passports, or insurance info, and personal info like addresses, phone numbers, or random notes that you'd like to keep private. \nPassword Boss also offers team plans, available in both Standard and Premium tiers with team-based sharing for five or more people. Fun fact: Charities, schools, and churches can apply to receive Password Boss for free.\nSign up for Password Boss Premium v2.0 for $29.99/year here.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Password Boss Premium v2.0 — $29.99/year\n              See Details\n            \n          \nLastPass Password Manager — $24/year\n\nA reliable, budget friendly option is LastPass Premium. This ultra user-friendly app has a few different plans offering various sharing features, so you're sure to find something that closely fits your password needs. The LastPass app can be installed on MacOS, iOS, Windows, and Android and can run its plug-in on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Opera. \nPro tip: LastPass' free version is seriously impressive. Ideal for a single person's personal use, it offers a ton more than the other free password managers out there, including syncing across multiple devices (a true rarity for a free version), two-factor authentication, single sign-on, and emergency access.\nIf you're dealing with business and multiple employees storing their passwords, the Premium plan is probably more fitting. You'll be able to create a digital contingency plan with others for emergency access, generate strong passwords, get extra secure multi-factor authentication, plus LastPass for apps. At $24/month, it's also cheaper than the premium plans from most competitors. Once in a while, you may come across a website with a layout so weird, some password managers literally don't recognize it. Fortunately, LastPass offers a manual save option in every password entry box.\nFor $48/month, LastPass also offers a family version with a family dashboard and unlimited shared folders. Up to six users will get Premium accounts and have access to group passwords to things like Netflix, WiFi, and TV, and more private credentials like bank account info. There are also business plans available.\nSign up for LastPass Premium for $24/year or LastPass Family for $48/year here.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Lastpass Premium — starting at $24/year\n              See Details\n            \n          \nZoho Vault — $12/year\n\nIf you're looking for a straightforward, nothing fancy password manager that still, you know, works, Zoho Standard is an awesome choice. Have as many passwords as you want, access them from any device with the Zoho extension, enable two factor authentication, and share with your team freely — all for only $1 each month.\nZoho's Standard Plan will let you know when it's time to change your password and can generate a new one for you, and allows sharing passwords with third parties who don't use Zoho. However, if you're using Zoho for work and have a team larger than five, you might want to bump up to the professional plan, which is Zoho's most popular service. By paying $4 each month, you can share chambers (password groups), which can speed up the process significantly if your teams all have separate logins for multiple websites. Zoho Professional also allows for the \"glass account\" to be broken in case of an emergency, which Zoho Standard cannot do.\nWhile Zoho's vault does allow storing of private data like bank accounts or health care info, it won't auto fill these for you in web pages. Sites with two-page logins like Gmail or Yahoo also give Zoho a little trouble, so keep that in mind if you use those email services. Zoho does not import passwords from browsers like the other services mentioned above, but once they are manually entered once, autofill steps in.\nSign up for Zoho Standard for $12/year or Zoho Professional for $48/year here.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Zoho Vault — starting at $12/year\n              See Details\n            \n          \nRoboForm 8 Everywhere — $19.95/year\n\nAnother affordable option comes in the form of one of the oldest password managers: RoboForm 8 Everywhere, a 15+ year old manager that recently got an upgrade. It works on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and Linux devices, supports browser extensions and can import passwords from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer, and other password managers. Compared to competitors' interfaces, RoboForm's is a little all over the place — but the same basic ideas are there.\nUnlike Zoho, RoboForm saves logins and passwords, as well as addresses and phone numbers (yours or other people's), credit card numbers, and any other fields that you're constantly filling in manually. Just use the toolbar to choose the credentials you need, and RoboForm will fill in the blanks. It even has an option to remember the answer to your security question, which is kind of convenient, but also kind of counterproductive. RoboForm will also generate passwords (with tougher requirements than most competitors), back up your data in the cloud, and designate \"digital heirs\" as your emergency contacts. A family plan is also available for $39.90/year, giving five users Everywhere licenses and secure sharing of common logins.\nAs for two-factor authentication, Roboform doesn't operate like most of the others in the bunch. The closest thing to that is One-Time Password, which sends a temporary password to the email address connected with the Roboform account any time a new device tries to log in. \nLearn more and sign

We started storing the food inside and assumed we had gotten rid of them once and for all. We were wrong, and now I have the video to prove it. \nSEE ALSO: There’s finally a Nest Cam for outdoors\nRing first broke into home security with its Ring Video Doorbell. When someone rings the doorbell, an alert is sent to your smartphone and you can view and talk to whoever's at your door. Alternatively, the doorbell can begin recording when it detects motion at your door and send alerts to your phone. And thanks to its built-in infrared LEDs, the camera works at night. \nThe $199 Ring Stick Up Cam works in a similar fashion, save for the doorbell part. Ring’s goal is to help ease your security fears by providing multiple products that complement one another instead of forcing you to buy a doorbell from Ring and an outdoor security camera from another company.\n\nWith the Stick Up Cam, Ring basically took its doorbell design, changed the housing color to all black and removed the doorbell button. \nThe two of them look nearly identical. That’s a bit disappointing, especially when you take into consideration the company’s Video Doorbell Pro, which is smaller and far more stylish.\nRecycled design aside, the Stick Up Cam isn’t necessarily ugly. Its black housing is unassuming, albeit a little mundane -- a welcome trait for a security camera you want to draw as little attention to as possible. \nSet-up is simple \nRing uses its Android or iOS app to complete initial setup of the Stick Up Cam, something you’ll want to do before mounting it to an outside wall.\nUsing the provided Micro USB cable, you charge the camera and then follow instructions in the app. The process involves pressing a button on the back of the camera, searching and connecting to its temporary Wi-Fi network and connecting it to your personal Wi-Fi network. \n\nInstallation, on the other hand, can be a bit more involved depending on your comfort level with a screwdriver and putting holes into your house’s exterior. Inside the box you’ll find screws, a screwdriver, a drill bit, and two different mounts. \nUsing any combination of the provided tools, you can do everything from mount the cam to an overhang or directly to an outside wall. \nBecause I have to return the product after the review period ends, I didn’t want to put any holes in my home. But after looking through the instructions it was clear that installing the camera is a straightforward process that shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes. \nDon’t worry about placing it somewhere rain or snow can’t reach; the camera is weather resistant and should be able to withstand some moisture. My review sample survived three heavy rainstorms in as many weeks without any issues.\nSolar power is optional \n\nRing states the battery in the Stick Up Cam should last six to 12 months on a single charge, depending on activity and use of its Live View feature. Alternatively, you can provide constant power to the camera through a Micro USB cable and a smartphone charger. Or you can spring for the $50 Solar Panel to provide consistent power to the Stick Up Cam. \nThe Solar Panel comes with a 5-foot Micro USB cable and a weather-resistant sleeve to help protect the charging port when connected to the camera. \n\nRing advises users to place the panel in an area where it will receive direct sunlight for two or three hours every day. Naturally, Ring includes all appropriate mounting supplies in the box along with the Solar Panel. \nI used the panel during my time with the Stick Up Cam, and found the battery to maintain a charge of 65 to 70 percent. \nMotion detection still needs some work \n\nHaving used the Ring Video Doorbell for the past year, I’ve grown accustomed to its finicky motion alerts. I’ve gone through troubleshooting with customer care, turned off motion detection altogether, turned off only particular sections the camera monitors, turned it back on, and everything in between. \nI’ve come to live with the fact that it’s not perfect and that I have to deal with the random motion alerts pushed to my phone. \n    Wait for it.  Ring Stick Up Cam review coming to Mashable soon. A video posted by Jason Cipriani (@mrcippy) on Jul 7, 2016 at 12:02pm PDT\n\nAs much as I wanted to believe things would be different with the Stick Up Cam, they weren't. I received several alerts during testing in which I was unable to see any movement at all in the recorded video. I don’t know if something quickly passed by the camera and it didn’t start recording fast enough or if there was a bug that flew by and set off the motion sensor. Look at this video and see if you can find what triggered it. I sure can’t see anything. \nFor its part, Ring tells me the company is constantly working on improving motion detection for the Doorbell and the Stick Up Cam through software updates (installed without you having to do a thing), and that the Pro version of its Doorbell has \"more advanced motion features.\" Why that same technology wasn’t brought over to the Stick Up Cam is a mystery to me.\nLive view and cloud recording \n\nAll Stick Up Cam users have access to the company’s Live View feature. Using Live View, you don’t have to wait for a motion alert to view your camera’s stream. You can open the app, tap a button and watch. \nIn testing the feature before launch, I never had an issue with the amount of time it took to establish a connection (both on Wi-Fi and a cellular connection), nor did I experience any issues with stream quality. The Stick Up Cam captures 720p video, by the way. \nRing offers a cloud recording plan at a cost of $3 a month or $30 per year for each camera connected to your Ring account. With an active subscription, you can go back and view old videos captured during a motion or live view event, complete with audio from both involved parties. \nPeace of mind is worth the price \n\nThankfully, the highlight of my time with the Stick Up Cam was it capturing the raccoon helping itself to dinner. \nThe Stick Up Cam did provide peace of mind. Knowing if anything was moving around on the side of my house, be it an animal or would-be bad guy, I would at least have video proof. \nThe overall design is boring and the fact that motion alerts arrive when there’s no motion is annoying. Hopefully, Ring is able to figure out the second of these frustrations through future software updates. \nSpending $200 on a camera, plus another $50 for the solar panel, is an investment. But it's an easily justifiable one if you live in an area where added serenity will help you and your family sleep better at night. \nRing Stick Cam\n          The GoodQuick, easy installation and setup • Provides peace of mind and extra security • Can view a live stream from camera, from anywhere on your phone or computerThe BadBoring design • Too many false motion alertsThe Bottom LineThe Ring Stick Up Cam with an attached Solar Panel is a truly wireless security camera for those looking to monitor more than just a front door."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F154552%252Fring-stick-up-cam-review-6.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=osxLlv0TJKFWq__C8E-RajnvgIY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F15425%252Fring-stick-up-cam-review-6.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=CL8IMepj3oxVCkRoAXdfAMvUZeo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F15425%252Fring-stick-up-cam-review-6.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=sFUldXdNj3rvj1QkNmYAFdvyzz4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F15425%252Fring-stick-up-cam-review-6.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=qQQrZckCijjgY8M_7-H_Ctof2SI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"This solar-powered home security cam is truly wireless and 100% green","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F15425%252Fring-stick-up-cam-review-6.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=sFUldXdNj3rvj1QkNmYAFdvyzz4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F15425%252Fring-stick-up-cam-review-6.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=sFUldXdNj3rvj1QkNmYAFdvyzz4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"This solar-powered home security cam is truly wireless and 100% green","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"procon":[{"data-title":"Ring Stick Cam","data-pros":"Quick, easy installation and setup; Provides peace of mind and extra security; Can view a live stream from camera, from anywhere on your phone or computer","data-cons":"Boring design; Too many false motion alerts","data-bottomline":"The Ring Stick Up Cam with an attached Solar Panel is a truly wireless security camera for those looking to monitor more than just a front door.","data-mashablechoice":"true","data-year":2016}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Peace of mind makes up for boring design.

A home security camera aids in this by allowing you to see what's happening around your house without having to get up close and personal.\nBlink XT2 cameras are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use, and you can check out the action they're capturing on your phone or compatible Echo device, like an Echo Show 5. If you don't have an Echo with a screen, that's OK — Amazon is throwing in a $10 Echo Show 5 when you purchase Blink XT2 security cameras.\n\nBlink cameras have customizable motion detection, two-way audio, and night vision, and can withstand elements like rain and snow. They're durable and reliable for peace of mind.\nAmazon's Echo Show 5 has all the Alexa features you love, plus the added convenience of a screen. It displays the time, has access to Prime Video, and (obviously) can show you what your security cameras are seeing.\nThese Blink security kits come with either two, three, or five cameras and include

device owners who want to use Google services like the Play store and Gmail are basically out of luck.\nThe Android OS maker published a post in Google's Android Help forum Friday titled \"Answering your questions on Huawei devices and Google services,\" as Gizmodo spotted. Apparently, Huawei users, or people thinking about getting Huawei phones, wanted to know whether they would be able to use Google services on new devices.\nThe answer was an unequivocal no, at least for new devices (and maybe, eventually, for older ones as well).\n\"Google is prohibited from working with Huawei on new device models or providing Google’s apps including Gmail, Maps, YouTube, the Play Store and others for preload or download on these devices,\" the post reads.\nWhile the international community is not in total agreement, the U.S. government considers Huawei a security threat. According to Chinese law, the government has a right to data sharing access and information from private Chinese companies, even non-state entities. The U.S. government has taken the position that this makes the use of telecoms technology from a Chinese company like Huawei too risky from a national security standpoint. So on May 16, 2019, it placed Huawei on its \"entities list,\" which prohibits U.S. interests from doing business with the company.\nThose high level politics have implications for Android users. Google can provide services and work with Huawei on tech for devices that were released prior to May 16, 2019. But it won't be giving Huawei devices access to the Google Play Store and Google apps to newer devices. It says any side door attempts to get Google apps on Huawei devices carry a \"high risk\":\nSideloaded Google apps will not work reliably because we do not allow these services to run on uncertified devices where security may be compromised. Sideloading Google’s apps also carries a high risk of installing an app that has been altered or tampered with in ways that can compromise user security.  \nIn other words: use janky versions of Google apps at your own risk, people.\nGoogle previously urged the Trump administration to allow it to continue working with Huawei devices, saying collaboration would ultimately make things more secure. They have apparently lost that battle."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111126%252F52185b1f-d043-473e-bb63-0bba2a2695cd.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=649j9P5jgtE-goeUW9lRYgqXNls=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111126%252F52185b1f-d043-473e-bb63-0bba2a2695cd.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=7K9noq99L_tnKMzW1M5XBv1-fV0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111126%252F52185b1f-d043-473e-bb63-0bba2a2695cd.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=IwYljefQ0W8cQEOmw9U8Hd8G2w8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111126%252F52185b1f-d043-473e-bb63-0bba2a2695cd.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=vwneSZXIubDYSUL35fPahHl8HCE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111126%252F52185b1f-d043-473e-bb63-0bba2a2695cd.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=hT8GF7DJWaTXyCD5_nSohFIsat0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111126%252F52185b1f-d043-473e-bb63-0bba2a2695cd.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=ZuRGhfxt87z-xYW2Va0R5slQlqY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Google to new Huawei owners: Use our apps at your own risk","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111126%252F52185b1f-d043-473e-bb63-0bba2a2695cd.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=IwYljefQ0W8cQEOmw9U8Hd8G2w8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111126%252F52185b1f-d043-473e-bb63-0bba2a2695cd.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=hT8GF7DJWaTXyCD5_nSohFIsat0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F111126%252F52185b1f-d043-473e-bb63-0bba2a2695cd.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=IwYljefQ0W8cQEOmw9U8Hd8G2w8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Google to new Huawei owners: Use our apps at your own risk","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Bad news for Google-loving Huawei users.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Google to new Huawei owners: Use our apps at your own risk"},{"_id":"5e4172d728cc360d99000014","id":"/shopping/feb-10-ring-home-security-systems-echo-dot/","title":"Ring home security systems are on sale, but maybe don't buy one","title_tag":null,"author":"Miller Kern","post_date":"2020-02-10T15:12:22+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 15:12:22 +0000","formatted_date":"02/10/2020","sort_key":"1J1aJw","link":"https://mashable.com/shopping/feb-10-ring-home-security-systems-echo-dot/","content":{"plain":"TL;DR: Ring security systems are on sale and come with a free Echo Dot, saving you up to $159. (But read on!)\n\nRing home security systems are offering some pretty decent price cuts right now and they come with a free Echo Dot, but we're not so sure you should hop on this deal. Ring doesn't have the best rap when it comes to handling your private data and personal information. The company partnered with law enforcement to grant them access to Ring doorbell footage, a program which you can now finally opt out of.\nRing has had so much negative press that competitor Arlo decided to capitalize on it (it's a dog-eat-dog world out there). If you already have a Ring or another type of video doorbell, Arlo will give you $50 to trade it in.\nThe deal on Amazon right now is on Ring alarm systems and does not include the brand's video doorbell, so you don't have to worry about visual hacking, but use caution in determining whether you want the hardware in your home. There are a couple different systems on sale, saving you up to $159.\nThe most basic system offered is a five-piece kit that includes a base station that keeps the alarm system online, a keypad to arm and disarm the system, a contact sensor that monitors doors or windows, a motion detector, and a range extender to ensure each component gets proper signal. Kits with additional pieces mostly include duplicates of the aforementioned, which is intended for larger homes.\nThe cool thing about these security systems is that they are compatible with Amazon Alexa, which is good considering they come with a free Echo Dot. If you're comfortable with Ring as a brand, check out its alarm systems on sale starting at $139.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n

security precautions'","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2020-01-14T00:01:01+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 00:01:01

been terrorized by hackers are now suing the company, saying the Amazon-owned firm doesn't even do the bare minimum to protect against hackers.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed earlier this month in the United States District Court, claims that Ring has shirked basic security measures that would help protect camera owners' accounts, even though the company has known that its devices are a popular target for hackers. \nThe suit comes after multiple reports of hackers gaining access to consumers' cameras and live video footage from inside their homes. \nIn one particularly distressing incident, a hacker yelled racial slurs at an 8-year-old girl whose mother had recently purchased a Ring camera from a Black Friday deal. That girl's parents are now plaintiffs in the class action suit. \nA spokesperson for Ring told Mashable the company doesn't comment on legal matters. Previously, the company has blamed its users for poor password practices, saying hackings have been a result of weak passwords or re-using passwords that have been previously compromised.\nBut the lawsuit points out that the company fails to take basic security steps that could prevent these kinds of attacks, even if camera owners aren't using two-factor authentication.\nRing does not require users to implement two-factor authentication. It does not double-check whether someone logging in from an unknown IP address is the legitimate user. It does not offer users a way to view how many users are logged in. It offers no protection from brute-force entries—mechanisms by which hackers can try an endless loop of combinations of letters and numbers until they land on the correct password to unlock account. Even though these basic precautions are common and unexceptional security measures across a wealth of online services, Ring does not utilize them for its services.\nThe filing further argues that Ring is well aware that its devices have become popular targets among hacker groups. Vice's Motherboard previously reported that hackers have created software that essentially streamlines the process for taking over Ring cameras. The lawsuit also notes that there is a \"a widely livestreamed podcast\" dedicated to hackers who gain access to random Ring cameras and harass their owners, as proof that the company knows it should do more to protect users. \nRing’s failure to properly safeguard access to user accounts is even more egregious in light of the presence of hacking forums and podcasts dedicated to hacking Ring devices.\nYet even in light of widespread reports of hacks and unauthorized access to devices, Ring has refused to take responsibility for the security of its own home security devices, and its role in compromising the privacy of its customers. Even as its customers are repeatedly hacked, spied on, and harassed by unauthorized third parties, Ring has made the non-credible assertions that it has not suffered any data breaches and that there are no problems with the privacy and security of its devices\nYou can read the full lawsuit below. \n   TZ LeMayVRing ClassActionComplaint by mashablescribd on Scribd"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1150037%252F3a1c882c-21ea-47bb-989b-9f899532e4ff.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=U2i1jhTDmLmHUozD2LIPjtJs5MI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1150037%252F3a1c882c-21ea-47bb-989b-9f899532e4ff.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=BL7fQxA9l77r7Wu7q5AVs0gb4zw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1150037%252F3a1c882c-21ea-47bb-989b-9f899532e4ff.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=tGED0PLZibxKw44bLbuoJHnZhAU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1150037%252F3a1c882c-21ea-47bb-989b-9f899532e4ff.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=xXdx0iA7L6sbnDzg910-WMoDQr4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1150037%252F3a1c882c-21ea-47bb-989b-9f899532e4ff.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=sYnt8qdms1rhQJoh5y10T3KwgYk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1150037%252F3a1c882c-21ea-47bb-989b-9f899532e4ff.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=CS9r2H_COsjwwrihXWo5LmR7a6I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Ring is now facing a class action lawsuit after several camera owners have had their devices taken over by hackers.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-ring-class-action-lawsuit-hacking-security.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-ring-class-action-lawsuit-hacking-security.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1150037%252F3a1c882c-21ea-47bb-989b-9f899532e4ff.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=wSVUKZQKLSM1QC8Movc-Kb-j7Gc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1150037%252F3a1c882c-21ea-47bb-989b-9f899532e4ff.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=c9YCnN2wUHMlQA1UBVADJD-kqpY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Ring is now facing a class action lawsuit after several camera owners have had their devices taken over by hackers."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Stephen Brashear / Getty Images"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Ring hit with class action lawsuit for 'failure to take basic security precautions'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The Amazon-owned company will have to answer to victims of camera hacks.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Ring hit with class action lawsuit for 'failure to take basic security precautions'"},{"_id":"5df90cf22463a35d9300000b","id":"/article/whatsapp-security-flaw-checkpoint/","title":"Crisis averted: WhatsApp fixed a lethal security flaw","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Kraus","post_date":"2019-12-17T17:14:21+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 17:14:21 +0000","formatted_date":"12/17/2019","sort_key":"1IHgqp","link":"https://mashable.com/article/whatsapp-security-flaw-checkpoint/","content":{"plain":"Imagine the app that is your communication lifeline unexpectedly and repeatedly dying. \nThe research arm of Check Point Security announced Tuesday that it found a WhatsApp vulnerability that could have caused frustrating and potentially disastrous functionality for users. The firm alerted WhatsApp to the problem in August, and it is now fixed. \nUsing group chat, Check Point was able to create an exploit that would repeatedly crash the app. WhatsApp wouldn't work again until the app was uninstalled, reinstalled, and the offending group chat was deleted. Here's a video demo of how it works.\n\nTo most users, the bug might sound like just a frustrating experience. But the researchers pointed out to Fast Company that for users like activists or dissidents, it could be especially harmful: The bug has the potential to interrupt communication, and would require deletion of chat logs, multimedia, and contacts in group chats. That scenario is a real possibility, considering WhatsApp is a favored communication tool, especially internationally, since it has end-to-end encryption.\nWhatsApp recently made changes to group chats to make them more secure and less susceptible to being a channel for spreading false and dangerous information. Before April of this year, anyone could add you to a group chat. Now, if you enable the setting, anyone can \"invite\" you to join a chat — but you have to accept or deny the invitation. Still, if you don't have your privacy specifically set to disallow group adding, anyone can simply add you to a group; groups can contain up to 256 people. \nWhatsApp has been the target of vulnerability exploits before. This spring, attackers started manipulating WhatsApp to totally take control over users' phones using Pegasus spyware. And in 2018, Check Point discovered that it could manipulate the sender names and text of forwarded messages, which enabled the spread of fake news.\nFacebook-owned WhatsApp has been taking action itself to combat fake news on WhatsApp by restricting the forwarding functionality. Despite fixes meant to make WhatsApp a tool for non-malicious communication, the work of these researchers show that the \"secure\" messaging platform is far from air tight."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1120956%252Fe5bd63c0-67f1-48f8-a008-b8b1abafb689.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=H9ff7XNptMjSi_v9uUs1K29jpwo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108207%252Facc3bb1f-8780-417f-ba8c-8281b48a2963.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=4MjHtCrP7A723qxF_HR0cfHblXc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108207%252Facc3bb1f-8780-417f-ba8c-8281b48a2963.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=2I8SY6j2aIQ1HtI-D3YWIhU5f3M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108207%252Facc3bb1f-8780-417f-ba8c-8281b48a2963.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=OwifqglumHhVsr66DPdNQITV_rU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108207%252Facc3bb1f-8780-417f-ba8c-8281b48a2963.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=xZJ01PdfMJV0hwayR24Rs3zLyWI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F108207%252Facc3bb1f-8780-417f-ba8c-8281b48a2963.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=SDMssKwfIJjh_8Q9B9V239BwAfs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"A crashing circle of hell","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-whatsapp-security-flaw-checkpoint.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-whatsapp-security-flaw-checkpoint.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1120956%252Fe5bd63c0-67f1-48f8-a008-b8b1abafb689.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=l0mImzD8Ajnnh1x-CdrMf5LimOA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1120956%252Fe5bd63c0-67f1-48f8-a008-b8b1abafb689.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=ei7UrjhhYRN3ETY9QoNc4d02xUo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"A crashing circle of hell"}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gett"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Crisis averted: WhatsApp fixed a lethal security flaw","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It was hiding in plain sight.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Crisis averted: WhatsApp fixed a lethal security flaw"},{"_id":"5dd734512463a323f300000d","id":"/article/twitter-2fa-security-update-remove-phone-number/","title":"Twitter just fixed a major problem with its security settings","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2019-11-22T01:05:19+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 01:05:19 +0000","formatted_date":"11/22/2019","sort_key":"1IxXnV","link":"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-2fa-security-update-remove-phone-number/","content":{"plain":"It's time to change your Twitter security settings! \nThat's because the company is finally, finally fixing a major issue with its two-factor authentication security settings.\nTwitter will now let users remove their phone number from their login verification settings, in a move that's already delighting security-nerd Twitter. \nAnother 🔑 update today: you can now use Two Factor Authentication without linking a phone number. If you already have your phone number linked along with App-based 2FA, you can unlink your 📞 it in the \"Account\" section of your settings while still keeping 2FA on. https://t.co/t63iRz2lIy— Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) November 21, 2019\n\nIf you're not already familiar, two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account so it's more difficult to hack. One common method is to use a phone number to receive SMS codes upon logging in, which are required in addition to your normal login credentials.\nThe issue with this is that text messages aren't very secure. And relying on SMS-based 2FA can have disastrous results when a determined hacker is involved, which is why most security experts recommend an app-based 2FA method like Google Authenticator. Otherwise, you're at risk of falling victim to SIM swapping, or a number of other creative methods hackers use to intercept text messages.\nThe problem for Twitter — and the reason why its 2FA has been widely criticized — is that up until now, the app still required users to opt into SMS security codes even when a third-party authentication app was enabled. Twitter has never publicly offered an explanation for this despite it being a major point of frustration for its security-minded users. \nThere's also the not-at-all-alarming fact that Twitter recently admitted it had \"inadvertently\" used people's 2FA phone numbers for ad targeting. (The company apologized and said it ended the practice.)\nLuckily, Twitter users no longer have to worry about any of this. As of today, the company is updating its security settings so it's possible to use two-factor authentication without adding a phone number.\nAnd, just in case it wasn't already completely obvious: Yes, you should absolutely change this setting right now.\nHead to your login verification settings (also available here) and make sure that \"text message\" is unchecked. (A Twitter spokesperson confirmed that the feature is still rolling out, so if you get a notification that removing text messages will disable login verification, hang tight and try again a little later.) Then, you can delete your phone number in the \"account\" section of your settings.\nThen, breathe a sigh of relief knowing that your account is now much harder to hack. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1086472%252F6c1d8a0b-4ebb-4c60-94c5-8b3db926995c.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=eFsSWT_FqBnBlhKmwaRPRl6hhj8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106867%252F13610213-b500-4e7f-bc4a-db890b4b397d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=cVbeLMlTYBlZSD8XLZyBcA1qpVI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106867%252F13610213-b500-4e7f-bc4a-db890b4b397d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=gly8Wb5k9WKlNI1UHDIH_NLQn0g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106867%252F13610213-b500-4e7f-bc4a-db890b4b397d.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=7_33ctXd0imAEccg3UDwhdWGq60=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106867%252F13610213-b500-4e7f-bc4a-db890b4b397d.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=d2kjEGoJFBGhok7Oz-eZllg-8LI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106867%252F13610213-b500-4e7f-bc4a-db890b4b397d.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=D8rJKGe1J5k-zlYEEvkTiiLqZ6k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Twitter finally updated its 2FA security settings to fix a major flaw.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1086472%252F6c1d8a0b-4ebb-4c60-94c5-8b3db926995c.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1086472%252F6c1d8a0b-4ebb-4c60-94c5-8b3db926995c.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1086472%252F6c1d8a0b-4ebb-4c60-94c5-8b3db926995c.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=TD63DhKJlSuXRo9S0kkoZVA3RUg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1086472%252F6c1d8a0b-4ebb-4c60-94c5-8b3db926995c.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=ElCtGgCFsftE1Iw9rhjk-OFS_6g=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Twitter finally updated its 2FA security settings to fix a major flaw."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Jakub Porzycki / NurPhoto via Getty Images"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Twitter just fixed a major problem with its security settings","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Update your settings now!","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Twitter just fixed a major problem with its security settings"},{"_id":"5dbaedc728cc362035000064","id":"/article/creepy-tech-gadgets-halloween/","title":"9 creepy tech gadgets and features spookier than a Halloween movie","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Kraus","post_date":"2019-10-31T14:20:52+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:20:52 +0000","formatted_date":"10/31/2019","sort_key":"1IqbjK","link":"https://mashable.com/article/creepy-tech-gadgets-halloween/","content":{"plain":"A mysterious voice coming from inside the house. A watchful eye you never knew was there. These scenarios may sound spooooooky, but they aren't paranormal.\nThese days, the plots of horror flicks can sound a lot like modern technology. We don't have to look to ghost stories or scary movies for tales of shadowy characters or the past never really dying. Tech products and hackers are our modern day Freddy Kruegers. Minus the, ya know, murder. \nIn honor of Halloween (and cybersecurity knowledge!), here are the spookiest tech gadgets and features.\n1. iOS 13 'Attention Correction' for FaceTime\nThe least human-to-human thing about FaceTime is that when you video chat with someone, you're not really making eye contact. Apple decided to do something about that problem of human connection with... artificial intelligence.\nIn July, Apple introduced a feature to FaceTime called Attention Correction. It uses AI to subtly alter the way a user's eyes appear to the person they're talking to, and make it look like they're actually making eye contact. \nIt hasn't exactly worked out: some users report that the effect is \"creepy.\" Uh, yeah! We don't remember asking for a disembodied intelligence to move our eyes around for us! This feature has big time \"eyes in the painting following you around\" vibes.\nWell that's fucking creepy - Attention Correction Feature in iOS 13 Beta Enables Appearance of Eye Contact During FaceTime Calls [Updated] https://t.co/0qx59KT4gP— newtman (@newtman) July 3, 2019\n\nApple *may* have gotten the message. One week after releasing Attention Correction in an iOS 13 beta, it removed the feature in the next iteration. However, it touted Attention Correction at its September hardware event, so the strange AI feature could still rise from the dead. \n2. Fitness trackers\nIn 2018, the world woke up to the fact that strapping a GPS to our wrists was *maybe* not such a great idea. That realization occurred when a Twitter user pointed out that they could find U.S. military bases by searching fitness app Strava's \"heat map.\" \nThese devices and apps are collecting, aggregating, and analyzing data about where real people are at all times. If you don't have your privacy settings toggled to give you the utmost privacy (Strava rolled out significant changes in September 2018), people could deduce a lot about you just from viewing GPS tracker data — which, in some cases, is public online. No thanks!\n3. Advertising pixels\nYou're not just being followed IRL.... there are a lot of eyeballs watching you in the digital realm, too. Advertisers are able to track your activity around the internet when websites place a line of code, also called a pixel, on their sites. That's why ads for, say,  some shoes you've been checking out, will sometimes appear on the next site you visit, and then eternally follow you around the internet forever more. Are you being haunted by the ghosts of would-be purchases past? You betcha.\n4. Suggested locations in Google and Apple Maps\nOne day, notifications started appearing on my iPhone: traffic is heavier than usual. It will take you 25 minutes to get to [my home address]. Helpful? Maybe. Creepy: good god yes.\nIf you don't have Location Services disabled, Google and Apple maps keep track of where you're going, and sometimes prompt you to name these places, or even suggest destinations. Both are getting better about giving you the ability to delete your location and route data. But let's be real: they know where you were last summer.\n5. Facial recognition\nFor anyone who's seen Face/Off, this is an obvious one. Facial recognition cameras don't just take pictures of your face, they create data that corresponds to your unique 3D proportions. Databases with 3D renderings of the world's faces is a little too House of Black and White for me.\nWhen it comes to using biometric data for security, like with Face ID, companies like Apple say that this data is decoupled from your identity. Tell that to John Travolta, Tim!\n\n6. Ring\nThere are a lot of smart security products out there, but none have reached the same Minority Report-ish heights of mass surveillance that Ring has. Multiple reports linking Ring to police surveillance and crime prevention have shown the role it might play in the law enforcement of a surveillance state. Plus, the ability to constantly be watching outside your home, no matter where you are? How Jeff Jeffries of you, Amazon.\n7. 'Memories' on iPhone, Facebook, and other 'Time Hop'-esque features\nThe past coming back to haunt you is the trope of too many horror films to name. Now, all the terrible photos and bad decisions you made on social media will eternally come back to life whenever a sentient algorithm decides to take you for a walk down memory lane. \n8. Bluetooth\nIf the killer always enters through an opened window or a door left unlocked, consider Bluetooth the back door into your digital life. Recent research has shown how hackers are able to exploit Bluetooth to gain access to your phone, intercept messages, and even play audio. Toggle that bluetooth off and don't let them in the house!!\n9. Smart Home Assistants\nWith Alexa, Google Home, HomePod, and Portal, it's easy to turn any home into a haunted house.\nAll of the big tech companies scrambled recently when reports showed that workers were listening in on audio collected in the home, sometimes containing intimate information; they have now revised policies to give users more choice over data collection. \nThere was also the incident when Alexa randomly recorded audio from its owner, and sent it to someone in their phonebook; a conversation just started playing out of the speaker out of nowhere! Who the HECK is in the house?!\nPrivacy missteps aside, the overall idea of a digital butler (that we've imbued with human qualities) that's always listening, waiting to be awoken to serve our needs, is the creepiest watchful presence of all.\nAdditional reporting from Jack

congressman, responsible for leading the lawmaking process and representing the interests of the American people, has a comically weak phone passcode. \nAn eagle-eyed viewer spotted Lance Gooden, a Republican representative from Texas, typing in his phone's passcode on camera on Wednesday during Mark Zuckerberg testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. Although Gooden can easily be targeted as a weak link in national security, his passcode appears to be a simple 777777. \n\nSEE ALSO: A Congresswoman addressed Mark Zuckerberg's dumb haircut mid-hearing\nThe GIF has over 146,000 views on Gfycat at the time of writing, and also hit the Frontpage of Reddit on Thursday. \nTwitter users were both horrified and amused at how ill prepared elected officials are when it comes to digital security.\nWhat's your passcode, Congressman? pic.twitter.com/DOcN5DkM5o— Zack Whittaker (@zackwhittaker) October 24, 2019\n\nSiiiiiiiigh. Just use FaceID if you're going to do this. https://t.co/8Pkxalby1K— 👻 YOU DIDN'T USE A YUBIKEY AND GOT HACKED 👻 (@msager) October 24, 2019\n\nCounterpoint: “123456” takes up too much time for such a busy policymaker https://t.co/4Z3gKCh8r3— Aki Peritz (@AkiPeritz) October 24, 2019\n\nSome noticed similarities between Gooden's passcode and Kanye West's, who went viral last year for typing in his very secure passcode of all zeroes on camera during his meeting with Donald Trump in the Oval Office.\nSeriously, this guy and Kanye West are just begging for someone to hack into their phones. https://t.co/4xZLAPRc1W— Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) October 24, 2019\n\nDespite serious concerns over his digital habits, Gooden is leaning into it. He responded with a joke that few Twitter users find funny.\nyou do realize you are a member of the US govt and we have very highly skilled adversaries that would love to compromise the mobile/global recording device you carry with you in your pocket to all government business.if you lose sight of that phone for 60 seconds, its hacked.— 🧛&#x200d♂️🧟&#x200d♀️ 0x7A69 🎃 travis 👻 0x2B21 🧟&#x200d♂️🧛&#x200d♀️ (@travofoz) October 24, 2019\n\nWhen Mashable's tech correspondent Jack Morse called out Gooden on Twitter, he responded by sharing an article Morse wrote in 2017 about how Apple's Face ID makes a device less secure than a strong alphanumeric password. \nJust following your advice, dude.https://t.co/NtQIwPb0va— Lance Gooden (@Lancegooden) October 24, 2019\n\nThat doesn't excuse 777777 as a passcode, though. \nShould we be worried? Yes. Are we tired? Absolutely. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105219%252F98a3af21-778f-48d1-9b6b-cbc2842e1c8f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=QKn8W-Hti9JUTAR_xQsO4AnbQlQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105219%252F98a3af21-778f-48d1-9b6b-cbc2842e1c8f.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=CfsO8TUk45VsJxGhky5Bfzy3C_Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105219%252F98a3af21-778f-48d1-9b6b-cbc2842e1c8f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=KcgBrj4U4QG74C7XwCXhd795tfQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105219%252F98a3af21-778f-48d1-9b6b-cbc2842e1c8f.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=5I6_GVhUR94gw3EJzp3Ln1r4W8U=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105219%252F98a3af21-778f-48d1-9b6b-cbc2842e1c8f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=6ondK6tWHzVRJN4g7DEdHNUPSTA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105219%252F98a3af21-778f-48d1-9b6b-cbc2842e1c8f.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=CqwaFmKzFhZpP-CcgLG8BtgxyYw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Wait, is this congressman's phone passcode just 777777?","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105219%252F98a3af21-778f-48d1-9b6b-cbc2842e1c8f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=KcgBrj4U4QG74C7XwCXhd795tfQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105219%252F98a3af21-778f-48d1-9b6b-cbc2842e1c8f.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=6ondK6tWHzVRJN4g7DEdHNUPSTA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F105219%252F98a3af21-778f-48d1-9b6b-cbc2842e1c8f.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=KcgBrj4U4QG74C7XwCXhd795tfQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Wait, is this congressman's phone passcode just 777777?","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Texas Rep.
